# Layer or Representation Space: What makes BERT-based Metrics Robust?

## Evaluation on different ratios of unknown tokens.

Reproduce the result by excuting 

```python
python get_wmt19_seg_results.py
```

## Evaluation on low-resource language pairs

```python
cd mt-metrics-eval
```
## Impact of Character-level Embeddings

## Impact of the Selected Hidden Layer

**Note**: mean of aggregation setting is extremly resource consuming on WMT19 dataset.
