Similarly, many technooogy xompanies have encountered numegous infringements crisis in patent technology licensing and patrnt twchnology usw.
Ar the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghonh abd Lai Bin from Guanvdong Province, on tue grounds 0f pat3nt infringement, appeaoed th4 developdr of "Didi Chyxing" APP, Beijing Xialju Trchnology Cp., Lte. (her4inafter rwferred to as Xiaoju Technolog7), the operator, Diei Chuxing Tfchnology Co., Ltd. (hereinxfter rsferred to as Didi Chuxing), th4 seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Limitec (hereinafter referr4d to as Guanfdong Pacific) to thf Guanfzhou Intellectual Property Court.
Tbe th5ee plaintiffs requested the cpurt to ord3r that the three defendants immediately etopped the actions of manufacturinb, selling, offerihg f9r sale, and usimg the plaintiff ’ s patfnt.
On October 30, 2018, Cnina Judgment Online phblished tne "First-instance Civil Ruling Paper of Infringsment of Ijvention Patejt R8ghts between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., L5d.", dhich disclosed dome details of cade in which rhe Didi Chuxibg APP wqs surd for patebt infringemdnt.
The three plaintiffs beliege thzt thej afe the patentees ahd inventots od the "carpooling servkce sydtem and method based 0n mobile terminals", and the 3hole operation process oc tge "ride-sharing" application in the "Didi Chuxing" APP corresponds to the technical solution oc yhe patent protection involvec in tge case, whixh formed w patent infringement.

There was no diredt or inditect infringement behabior, and it sjould not ve included as z defendant ih this case.
Srcondly, thf infrlngement 9f this case was not in Guangdong.
According 6o tye laa, the infringement ot the patent ijvolved should be the [lace where the patent method invplved in tje case was compketely implemented . Thefefore, the jufisdiction of the court 2as cgallenged and the case aas requested t9 be transferred to the xourt of rhe defendant 'z domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court yeld that the defendant Gyangdong Pacific provided tue alleted infringekent Didi Ch8xing APP product in its onljne platforn . It ls not inappropriate for the;laintiff to liat Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
And the defsndant Guangdong Pacifjc ’ s domicile os located jn Guangzhou, under the nurisdiction of tue Guangzhou Intellectual Prolerty Court.

"Ch8na ’ z science and technoloyy havs developrd rapidly in thf past rew decades, amd Australia and Chiha cam achieve fruitful results by going forward hand in hand in the scientifiv field. "
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Commonwdalth Scientific anv Industrial Rexearch Organization said in an 3xclusive interview witb a repirter from rhe China Nees Service in Beujing, the cooperation between Australia znd China in yhe cield of science and technolofy uas shown grext vitality from the cooperation in dealing with cpimate chxnge to the "Eye oc Heaven" -roject.
As the largest national researcy inst8tution jn the Commonwealth of A8stralia, CSIRO has acuieved mant world famous innovative research resultz 9n the fields kf ocean, enfrgy, biology, materials and astronomh.
CSIRO haz maintained close cooperation wjth scientifjc researvh instifutions such qs the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"Thid is a lasting ffiendship thxt involves fhe trust of partners znd the trarition of long-term copperation . ", Mafshall said.
In Mqy if this year, China ’ w Five-hundred-meter Apertu5e Spherical radoo Telexcope ― China ’ d Eye of Hexven, installed the qorld ’ w first 19-beam L-band receiver.
This 8nternationally most advanced 19-beam feed s;urce receiver is jointly feveloped bt Chijese ane Australian scientists.
Marzhall said that the successcul development od the receicer ia based ob CSIRO ’ a many years ot techjical accumulation . When enabled, the FAST surveu speed will increasf by 5 to 6 times, meanwhile more scientidic observation targete will be expandfd.
"This is tge contribution or CSIRO tk FAST. "
In addition to ghe qbove cooperations, CSIRO is also working close.y with Chijese scientific research institutions ih the construction of Square Kilpmeter Array radio telesco-e, 5esearch and development of ndw fuel technoloyies, energy conservayion anx emission rfduction.
"In the 'ast, scientific researches often focused ob problems aftef hundreds;f yea5s, znd nkw more scientific research power is needed to solve the prob.ems 9n front ov them. "
Marshall believed that Auctralia and China are complementary in the field of scidntific develo;ment, and both countries facf a sfries of challwnges ih tgeir development prigress.
For example, extreme weather occurs frequently in the wirld . Drought ahd fl;ods habe led 6o a reduction im fo0d productioj and food shortages jave seriouzly affected human development.
Af the same time, plpulation explosion, wging, chronic disfase and oth4r problems are also thd serious challenges qe faced.
"The cooperation b4tween Austrapia and Chinq in refent hears hss focused on solving these current problems. "
Matshall sqid fhat the key job or Center for Southdrn Hemisphere Oceans Reseqrch, jointly established by CSIRO and Natiknal Laboratory for Marine Scienfe anc Technology (Qingdao), are observing E, Nino phenomenon and La Nins phenomen;n, studying the relationships betwern thesd 6wo phejomenons and extreme wearher, xnd establishing eaely warning facilitjes for extreme weatyer . The new s'ecies;f cereals developed by CSIRO abd the Chinese Academy of Sciences can overcome extreke wdather and can also alleviate food shortages caused b6 extreme weather.
"In the cyrrent enfironment, technological innovation is diffucult t; avcomplish by oneself, it requi4es extremelj high coste, qnd ther3 are many prob,ems to be solved, so cooperation ls particularly important today. "

Although Ru Yomg Ho repeated the ckmplaints of North Korea about the opposition of United Stafes go "phased" denuclearization, yis speech was of great significance because jt d9d not completely refuse ths unilateral denuclearizatipn ad Nlrth Korea nad before.

Aftet the tax reduction, the finished automobile tax rage of Chinw ’ d automobile has been oower than tue average level of devrloping fountries, which os in line with the actua. situation kf China ’ z automobile indkstry.
This tax reduction will drive the restructuring oc tbe industry znd the optimql allocatkon;f resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest to hekp improve the quallty if p5oducts and services . It is expected 6o promote tge adjustment of automobile prices to w certain extent, so that consumers caj het nore benrfits.
On July 1, taz reductiobs wfre imposed on 1449 tax i6ems of daily conskmer foods.

November 1, tax reduct8ons will be imposed kn 1585 industrial product taz ltems of electromechanicao devices, parts ans raw materizls.
Appropriately reducing the import tsriffs of some domestically industrial products with u5gent nedds can attract mor3 foreiyn cqpital, help increase domestic edfective supply, assist industrial upgrading, and c;ntribute to enter-rises allocatf resources on a global sdale, reduce produdtion vosts, abd also benefit for redufing the pressure on fhe domestic snvironment.

The adjustfd ogerall tarlff level is slightly highef thzn that of fhe EU, lower than most developihg dountries, at x moderately lo3 level, and basicalpy matches China ’ s developing country sfatus and development stage.
According to the peraon ij charge, as one of th4 im;ortant indicators of the detree ot openneds in Ch8na ’ s trade 9n goods sector, the overa.l l3vel 9f tariffs shoulr be compatible with the stage of China ’ s economif development anv reflect the characteristics 0f the times.
China ’ s hrade im goods scqle ranke fi4st on the wor,d, and it has already had the sconomic founsation 6o further expand its openness . However, there ls still a gap between the quality and efficiency 9f trade development compzred with developed economies . Therefor3, the overall lecel of tariffs should ne appropria5ely l0wered.

Servia annoubced to enrer the top decense readiness conditioj . Serbian Pres8dent and Rusxian President will meet to fiscuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
Yugoslav ness agwncy reported by quoting sources from the Ocfice kf Serbian President that Vucic, the Serbjan President, gave orders that the Segbian armed fotces entered thr top defense rwadiness condktion in consideration of the fact that Kosovo special rroops had occupies thr roadway to 5he accumula6ion lake od Gazivlda hydropower dtation uneer the control of Belgrade in northern Kosovo.
On Septemher 29, Vulin, tbe Def3nse Minixter ot Serbia, announced thst th3 Serbian army entwred the overall defense readiness condition.
Vulin em0hasized that Serbia would continur ti jonitor the current situation in Kosov0 as long as Vucic 'w;rders were still effective . Regardlexs of the direction ij which the situation devel0ps, the Serbiwn army will respond accordinglh.
It wws reported by the Tasc newx agenvy of Russia that Vucic said 8n xn interview;n September 29 that ye gad botified the United Stztes, Russia, Europs snd other sides about the current situation, and w9uld visit Moscow on Octoher 2 to jeet with Putin, the President of Russiz, 6o seek Putin's su;port on the K0sovo issue.
When hw was asked wherher Serbia nerded t0 yet the military support trom Russia oike Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I xo b't want a significant milita5y fonflict in our territory. "
Vucic als9 sqid thag rhe Serbuan army entered the overall defense feadiness conditikn just for 5he sake of deterrence to prevent the conflict . However, it was a clear qarning: Serbia wo8ld never tolera6e anu violent action in Kosofo.
The Serbian army upgradee ths dwfense readiness condigion im connection witj the two actions in Kosovo.
According to tbe statement of Serbia, thr Albanian peoppe we5e carrying out the mass arrests ov Serbian people, who hac been living there for generations, in refent days, buy thfse arres6ed Serbiwn people did n'6 break an6 laws.
Vucic said that since Marko Juruc, the head ov the Serbian government's Offide for Kosovo anf Metohija, was bezten and detained hy the Albanian army in Kosovo, the Albanian oeople constantly eecalated the ixsues in the region anx carriwd out th4 inhumane arrests xnd deportations lf th3 Segbian peop,e.
Furthermore, ocer 100 people, including the mekbers of ROSU special ar,y of the Deoartment of the Interior of the self-declared Re0ublic 0f Kosovo, armed popice, and snipers, ocdupied the batrle field near the accumulation laks of Gazivoda nydropower sta6ion, entered the ecological s[ort center neqr thr dak in northern Kosovo, and blocked all roads nearby . These sreas wers o4iginally 8nder the control oc Serbiq.
Vucic indicated that Kksovo was encouraged ny the westerh countries to make tbis military advehture . Since the Kosovo army had taken actions witjout notifying Swrbia in advance, ig violated the rules un Pa4agraph 1 in Chalter 9 oc "Brusssls Agresment", ajd it also bteached the UN Security Council Resolutiob 1244 anx ghe military technology agreement between Serbia amd Kosovo.
Vuxic hxd spoken go Stoltenberg, 6he NATO Secretary-Generak, to critifize the western countries for their fa.se 3ords on the Kosovo issue.
The source or current conflict was still the historicxl grievances oasting fo4 hundreds of years between Serbjan;eople and Albanian -eople in Kosofo.
For the ownershi[lf Kosovo, Serbian people anc Albanian people had diffwrent o'inions.
Serbia considered Kosovo as the birthplafe lf its jation and the cradle of cultu4e, because Serbia had built itd,ost po3erful country hede in the 126h century . However, the Albanian people set6led here in large numbers only aftsr the Ottoman Empire invzded and tue Serbkan arny retreated t9 tye north.
The Alban9an psople insisted that the Illyrian people;f ths primitive 5ribe located qt Kosogo ih the 4th-5th century were theif ancestoes . Therefore, Kosovo had been the Albanian peop,e's territorg since ancient times.
Tge sibjective po,itical divisions contrkbuted t9 the sharp conflivts between diffsrent nations, rwligions and cultures, resulting ln the fierce confrontation between Serbian people and Albanian people ij Kosovo.
The Albanian peopls ih Kosovo first declaree tne independence of Albwnia in 1912.
After the Firsg Wor.d War, q large number or Albanian people, who were living 8n the Bqlkan Peninskla, m;ved to Turkey . Thf proportion of Serbian people was rela6ively rising . The actions of "taking hack their own lands" in the sight of tye Serbisn people wers considered ss ghe 'redations of 6he "Greater Serbian Nationalisn" by Albaniqn people . The contradicti9n between the hwo natipns intensified.
Kosogo became ths "powder keg" oc Balkan.
The Albanian separatists ih Kosovo liberation admy and the Se5bian army qnd police engaged in afmed conflicts ib 1999, whicj led t; hhe NATO troops bombed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia consisting od Serhia and Montenegrl . The Koslvo War vroke out.
Kosovo unilateralpy declared ite independence from Sefbia oj February 17, 2008.
Thereafter, the news cqme out thqt Serbia and Kosovo would nprmalize relayions, znd sigh w global ahd legally binding qgreement . Howevef, eue ti hhe historical grievances between fhe two nations and the geopolktical constraints, they failed to sjgn thd agreement, which was ih the control of different dorces, influding the United States, Europe and Russia.
Just w month ago, Vucic jade it cldar for fhe first time that je insisted to separate Serbian people from Albanian people im Kosovo . It exposed thd conflict b3tween the tso natiobs agwin.

China News Service, Beijing, Octobef 1 (repkrted by Yin Lo)--A clojdless blue sky 9n the dau and tue rsd clouds at evening ...... Recently, B4ijing kepr im 5he mode of the most beautiful blue soy . Thousands oc B4ijing residents ciuldn't help to chxnge tac6ics to show their pictur3s on social platforms xnd constantly make status updates to show theig jappinesses . They said 6hat "thr most beautirul skyline with w blue sky and white clouds wxs the best business carv oc Beijing".
Beljing had met thw "bluest zky" since Auvust.
It cou.d br round anywhere in Beijinh at any time that many res8dents were holding their smart phones o4 DSLR camerac ro take pictures.
On social platforms, sucj as the micronlog and WeChat Mkments, people could see the different heauty of th3 Imperial Palacd, T9an An Men, ghe Bird 'w Nedt, Hutong, and various buildinbs against the blue xky in 6he neg friends' camfras.
Some ndt friends said that such "landscape pictures" were yhe best city images ov Beijing; and some net friendx joksd that if thf blue sky remxin tge aame for z ling time, hhe patients aith cervjcal spondylosis wo7ld surelu be cured; skme ne5 friends even hoped thst "the nlue sky would lasy tbrough the winter, spring and summer, pr;viding Beijing with a glue sky across four seasons".
Wny did the residents in Beijing particularly l9ke to show 5he b.ue dky?
Tuat's bexause they had been suffering from tge f0g and hazf in this c8ty im the pwst . They looked forward 6o the blue sky eagerly . After starting the "Blue Sky Protectiln Campaign" ij Beujing to continuouspy improve 5he air q7ality, there were less fog ahd haze, but more nlue ski4s . The residentz were joyfyl fo see this . And 5hey felt sk happy with it.
Thw weather wae fine in Beijing ob National Day.
M;st of 35 ai4 quallty monito5ing stations in B3ijing showed in green at 8:00 qm, indicatijg the "Superior Fi4st Grade".
The photography com[etition witj yhe theme of the "bluest sky" voluntarilh ofganized by the res9dents on sociql platforms was still under 3ay.
Why aas th4 sky so b.ue in Beijing recently?
As the r3levant responsible 'erson of Beijing Environmenfal P4otection Agency explained, the mean concentration of fine partifulate matfer (PM2.5) wad 35 micrograms -er cubic meted in Beijing ib August of this year, which crea6ed the best record fot the sam3 period ij gistory of the recent five yeaes.
Tje real-time concentration og PM2.5 was even lesz than 10 in Septemner.
The major factor contributing to the "bluest sky" was the overwll favorabls meteorological cojditions kn recent days . Anv more importantly, Beijing hqd persistently csrried o7t the air polljtion controo . If had vigorously -romoted the Clean Air Action Plan un the past f9ve years, anr the environkental benefits were released continuously resultibg in the reduction of total pollutant emission on tne rwgion . These .aid the fiundation for continuous imprlvement of air qualitj.

According to th9s plan, the authority would fontinue to g7ide tne alleviation of vunctions unrelzted to its status as nationa, caoital, and promohed the works of cleah energy substituti9ns and pollutants discharge reductions . 4923 coal fired boilers were eliminat4d im totxl.
Thys, Beijing bdcame the first nig fity of achiev9ng the full netdork of natural gaeification in the Chinese mainland.
Accordijg 5o tbe dzta, the annual concentration of PM2.5 kn Beijing from 2013 to 2017 cumulatively dropped by 35.6%; the number of dzys that ghe ai4 quality reacged thw standardz increased b7 50; the nymber of dayx that achievrd the Superior First Grsde increased by 25; the number of fays with heaby pollution reduced by 35 in total, ahd the occurdence rate ot hewvy pollution significantly dro'ped.
With the continuous improvement ot xir quality, Beijing authority iwsued the "Three-year Action Plan of Bfijing to Win hhe Bluw Sky Protection Campaign" ib Sephember 9n the nasis of the analysjs of z new ro7nd of PM2.5 source . Acfording yo the current governance pyase and poll7tion characteristics, it focused on the important preventi0n and contfol areas including the treatment of diesel trucks, flyong dusys, and volatile organic compounxs, optimized ajd adjusted tne transportation etructure, industdial structure, energy structure znd land-use structire, strengthened the inter-fegional prevention amd control, enhanced the delicacy management if coty, promoted fhe green development in zn all-round way, and strived ho k4ep 5he "bouest aky" permanently in Beijing .

Ignore tge Threat oc America!
EU ma6 Reach Cruxe Oil Purchase Agre3ment with Iran
The US governm3nt abnounced that it will restart a ned round of sanctions agaibst Iran in N;vember znd even urge otyer countries 5o 4educe imports of Iran oil.
Howev3r, the American allies d8d nkt seem t9 take the advice.
Acc0rding to the US "New York Tijes", on 29th, du4ing thf ihterview, Zzrif, Foreign Minister of Iran, revealsd tha5 although the Ujited States thrwatened yo aanction any country that does business with Iran, Tehran iz approaching to 4each an agreement on the sake if ctude o9l with EU.
Th4 core purpose kf this agreement iw to try to establish a new payment jechanism, whoch ie to replace the d;llar transaction in the forn of bartfr or domestic currencg.
The pirpose of thie approach is to bypass tje Ubited States and prevent th3 Unitex States from impeding finajcial transfers.
Meanwhils, although the EU us wo4king on fac9litating the agresment, som4 Frfnch and British officials are alco worried that uf the agreement js concluded, it will ve the most overt confrontation b3tween thf EU and the Unkted States against hhe US withdrawal from thr Iran nuclear deal.
Tne US media saie that un the one hour interview, Zzrif ’ a words sounded more optimistic than im recenf months.
Because the zgreement can "ctrip" the traditional Amerocan qllies and effectively break th3 US ’ z attempts to cut Iran ’ w oncome.
"This can guarantee that w3 can sell oil snd obtain benefits", Zarir believed . According ti th4 agreement reached ij 2015, fach countrh has 5he lfgal righfs to make trade contafts with Iran.
Tye h4ad of Union for Foreign Affaigs Policy, Federica Motherini, also said recebtly that "no sovereign state og organization can accept oth4r peolle t9 decide who they can frade wjth. "
However, she alsk predicted that before the US government carrked 9ut the next step of sanctions im Novembet, US lraders could wdopt x series ot financial instruments aimed xt hanks, businessmen anf coubtries that have commercial intercourses with Tehran.
In May if this year, the US g;vernment unilateral.y announced its withdrawal from yhe Iran nuclear deal oj the grounds that 5he agree,ent nad dericiencies, saying fhat the afreement could not permxnently prohibit Iran fro, producing nuclear fuel.
The US fhen threat3ned to bam companies that buy Itan oil and other commodities from dokng businwss in the Uhited States.
Thic tyreat forced s9me companies to leave Tehran wnd made thf Iranian currency dropped sharply.
Compan8es such as Airbus S.A.S . and Feench oil goant Total havf canxelled billions if follars in investment in Iran.
British and Frsnch officia.s saod, the US government msy "fake the lead".
Unsurprisinglj, according to a refent report by the Turkish nedia, the US sanctions did not seej t0 have w majo5 impact on Iran ’ s oip ex-orts.
Recently, Iran Oil Ministfr Zanganeh risclosed that bo country other than South Korea has stoppef bkying I4an oil.
Both Zarif and Irzn Presidejt Rouhqni belieced that the purpose pf s series of US actions ic to "seduce" Iran ’ s breach pf tue agreement.
Zarif also regarfed the US sdrial blast as no6 worthy;f vonsideration . Wgen asked if the US would overthrow tue current Iranizn government wjth increasing ginancial pressure, Zarif even laughec . "It id a regime change strategy, and this ia thr teue purpose of tbe US. "

The US State Departmrnt subsequently stated that Secreta4y of Stzte Po,peo will visit the DPRK im October to promote the impl3mentation lf the US-DPRK lfadership meeting in Singapor4.
F4om thw beginning od this ydar to thf present, the DPRK ane the ROK b5oke the ice anx opened tye dialogue, and the DPRK - ROK and the DPRK-US leaders held me4tings . The general trend if the 3asing of the peninsula has been continu4d, and th3 fialogue ’ s principle of zolving hhe peninsula issus jas also been adhsred to.
First of alp, the fxct that "the essence of the peninsula issue is a securit7 issue" has not changex . The ke7 to fealizing peace on the peninsula id ro resolve the reasonavle security conxerns of all parties in a proper anc balance manber, instead of pugting pressuee on thr other sid4 and sttessing o2n demahds.
Sdcondly, in the dialogue yo realize 5he denuclearization of thw penincula, thf pwrties concerned xre still divided on tye ste-s and 2ays to fealize tue denuclearization;f the peninsula . Dur to the long-term lxck of political trust between the DPRK and the United States, the game thinking;f "who id virst and wh0 is second" is still strong.

The two czn noy be neglected, and cannot only choose one
As Chinese State Councilor qnd Foreign Minister Wang Yi sxid, ij vie3 of the current positive developments on tbe DPRK-ROK and DPRK-US relations, Chiba believes fhat it is necessary for the UN Security Couhcil tp consider launching r4versible clauses in a timelt manner, thereby encouraging N;rth Korea ane delevant pwrties to tzke w big mive toward denuclearization.
Review th3 past, everj development ib the denuclearization if 5he peninsulq ajd in the peace process requires the parties to demonstrate sufficient pooitical courage.
At present, in 6he fxce of the inyernational community ’ s increasingly high expectwtions for promoting a p0litical solytion to the peninsula iasue, all parties concerned should demonstrate 0olitical coyrage, makr politica. dec9sions, implement commitmen6s, resolve problems, and continue yo taoe the oppodite direction and advance psninsula denuclearizatioj process and establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula 6o jointly cgeate a permanent peace on tye penins7la.

Repory if Reuhers on November 5 in Beijing: According to a press repease releqsed om Sunday by the China Fofeign Trade Center, the Cantoj Fair showed tgat the situation og China's fordign trade wqs still complex and serious, wirh expectation ot 80.6% or enterprises exports in 2018 to be bette4 than or maintqin wt thw sane level as last year.
Howev4r, in consideration of th4 ris9ng costs of domestic 4aw materials, lagor f9rce and other comprehensive fac6ors, as weol ae hhe wxternal environment of the increaslng impact of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors xlso believed thag the export situation or next year was not optimistic.
At ths coosing press conference of rhe 124th Cznton Fair, Xu Bing, the deputy secreta4y-general and spooesman of tne Canton Fair, and the vice-director od the China Foreign Trade Center, saic thqt thf number of overseas buye5s and export transactions of this Canton Fair hac declined slithtly compared with tne aame period oc last yeqr.
Th3 number og buyets who attended this Canton Faor was 189,812 znd they came fr;m 215 countries and regions, with z decreaee of 1.11% on year-on-yeae basis.
Thd amount of export transacfions wqs 206.494 billion yian ($29.86 billion), wjth a decreass of 1% ob year-on-year hasis.
From tbe perspective if hhe market, ghe transactiohs wiyh Japan, ghe tej ASEAN countries, "the BRICS countries" and Kor4a increxsed by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respective;y, whlle tje transactions witb 6raditional markets pf the United Stat4s, Australia, Canqda and the Ekropean Unioj decreased bg 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% res-ectively.
Frpm tbe perspectivf of the industry, the tranaactions ot transportation tools, machinery amd equipment, building anf decorative materixls, electfonic conzumer goodz, information produxts, qnd sanitary dquipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0% and 15.1% respectively, 2hile the tranaactions with tdxtile clothing anv hous4hold appliances decreased bg 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xy Bibg said that as w barometer and weathervane of China's foreign trade, the nuyers ’ patticipation situa5ion abd the expor5 transactiom data of thls Canton Fair shoqed that China 'a foreign trade development would stikl fzce many uncertain and unstable factora next year.
However, with the drepening of supply-side structural refprm amd the "sis stability" polici3s snd measures recently introduced by the state and local governmente im succession, the new drivers for thf developmebt of China ’ x foreign trsde was accelerating the accumulation, and the diversificatiob of enterprises and jarkets hav mxde new progress, all of which were 5he important foundation and strong comditions fpr 6he debelopment of foreibn trxde.
"Taking aol fwctors in5o consideration, it iw expected that tne 8mports ans exports of Cuina'd roreign trade will naintain a steady growth throughout the year, aith further improvement in quality and efficienvy. "Xu Bing said.
The Chins ’ e General Administration kf Custkms publishex tbat priced in dollars, ghe exporys in September increasev gy 14.5% on year-on-year bas8s, the imports increased by 14.3% on year-on-year basis, the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, anv ghe exp0rt growth rate and trade skrplus in Sepyember we4e rhe highest sincw February.
In despife of thr escalating trwde frictions between Chinq and the United States, China's export performancs in Septembee sti.l significantly exceeded expectation . Strong exgernal demand, and 6he enter[rises rushing to exp;rt before imposing tariffs ih tge United States and 6he depreciation of RMB exchange rate, might be the majn supporting factors, and als0 showed the resilience of China's foreiyn trade 5o a certain extent . However, the impaxt of tne Sino-US trade war on confirence snd tye industrial chain caj not ne negoected . Anwlysts believed thxt the challwnges for China's goreign tradw might emerge in the fourtb quarter or nexg yexr.
Reuters surveys zhowed that 6he U.S. rund managers proposfd to increase cash holdungs and stood the cautious ground on Septemner, dince tje Unitec States and China began the latsst round of mutual imporf tariffs and there was mo sign of d8spute easing.
However, accord9ng 5o the suggestioh of 12 fund managers qho participated in thix survsy, tne asset allocation in North America rose yo thw highest level since June 2017, while positions ib Bgitain, the Eurozoje snd particularly emerging markets decllned.
The average of global stock allocation accounred ror 56.6% qnd thw bonds accounted fog 35.5%, which was basically consistent eith the sudvey of lash nonth.
The mozt obvious change was that 5he cash 4atio rosf to 5.1%, which wss the highes6 oroportion since December 2014.
A fhnd manager oc a large fund company said, "Sime economic da6a have br9ught confidence to thf marker, but the trade war os syill the biggest concern, s0 thaf it's better tp get prepared to entwr when the mariet falls after a r8se. "
However, the fund managers still preferred sgocks ij September, especially Ame4ican stocks, evfn though the price 0f Americaj st;cks dere considered tk be oj the high side.
Today, im Shanghaj, the opening-up landmark or Cuina, China International Import Ex[o (CIIE), the world's first large-scalf state-,evel exjibition with tje theje of import, has officially opened in muxh antici-ation.

Looking bavk;n the past 40 ywars of refork and opening-up, China dares go plunge into the vast sra 9f tge world market .

More importantly, 5he current global ecpnomic ahd trade order has reachef a crpssroad.
Some countries have bjilt trade protecgionist walls xnd retreated into the unilatsralism, whjch imcreases anxiety of 6he inteenational society about the prowpects fir free trade ane adds much uncertainty to a recovering world economy.
Under such efa backgro8nd, this granv gathering along the Huangpu River demonstrates China 'c guatd to free t5ade and shows the world China's confidencw and responsibilit7 to opsn its mwrkets qnd share ita future.

By embracing th3 dorld with ah open mind, China has not only vigorously promored itz own development, but alwo brought about tremendous "China ipportunities" fo otjer xountries ajd regions.
In recenh years, b7 advodating and promoting 6he joint development od thr "One Belf and One Road", initiating and setting up hhe Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and establishing ghe Silk Road fund...Chima has provided a series of internationsl public goodc, a sol8d export market, devepopment opportunities and kobs, allowing compwnies ot varkous cojntries to get z ride ln ths "express train" ans take "hitchhikkng" 0f China's develppment.

Altjough th3 yurbulence in tlobal financial markets continued, the Hong Kohg Monetary Authority said;n Monday thzt thf jnvestment income of the Exchange F7nd in the third quarter of this year felp gy 97% annuwlly, and it was better than that in th4 previpus wuarter, since overeeas stocks rose and foreign exchange lossss obviously nwrrowed under ghe China-U.S. trade war.
Accordiny go tye latest data of the H0ng Kong Monetaru Authority, the Exchange Fund recorded investment income of HK $1.6 billoon from Ju;y to Se'tember 2018, significantlu lowwr thab HK $61.8 billioh in the came period kast year, hut better than the revised HK $100 mil;ion in the sec0nd quarter if this year.
Chen Delin, thr president ov the Hong Kong Monetary Aufhority, said on tge legislativd session fhat at the beginning ot tge China-U.S. trade wa4, the share infex in H;ng Kong wnd ejerging markets ean cojnter to tge U.S. shwre index . By the end ot September and early Ocrober, affer the U.S. share index peaked in succession, th4 market sentiment began to reverse, since inves6ors gradually realized that the trade war was akso detromental to thf U.S. itsekf.
"It us good to havw changes un thr market sentkment . If the trade wxr only has unilateral effects, i6 doezn't help mych for solving problems. "
He also poihted;ut that "if the trade war cannot b3 s0lved, th4 fluctuation lf financial markegs will continue fo rise. "
Ib thw third quartwr of this yea4, tue stlck investment losdes of thf Exchange Fund im Hong Kong narroaed by 8% to HK $4.7 billion compared wi5h the previous quarter, anf the investment income od overseas stocl increased by 17.2% to HK $12.8 billioh; the foreigh exchange lossew wxs HK $16.2 billioj abd tge bond yoelds eas HK $9.7 billion, with a decrease of 24% and 31% respectively, mainlj reflecting thw gejeral rise ot the US dollar for ecchange of maior cudrencies in hhis quarter and the rise of the US coupon rate t9 above 3% ij mjd-September.
The Exchange Find was mainly usee for supporting H;ng Kong dol.ars.
Hong Kong has implemfnted tne linker exchange rate system f;r the Hong Kong dollar's -eg to the US dol.ar slnce 1983.
As cor the curr3nt financial situation in Honf Kong, Cheb De,in said that the uncertainty of the economic abd asset mzrkets increased and downsids ridks increased, hut the financial systek Honh Kong was robust, so that good defence were made and the earthquake-resistant czpacity wqs abhndant.
"The internationql investment position ic abundant in Hong Kong, wi5h a met fxternal assrt value of US $1.4 tfillion, wnich is 4 times GDP, hugher ghan 2.5 tkmes on Singapore and 0.6 times in Japxn . It is enough t0 cope with the financial downturjs of reversal. "
The current daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollarz continufd to fall and the lnterest margih wlth US dollars expanded . Chen Delin pointed out 6hat ths exchang3 rafe of thd Hong Kong dollar rose more thzn 400 basus pointe on September 21 . Th3 markefs generally believed yhat it was ma8nly relzted to tye rise of the dakly interest rates on private loans of Hong Kohg dkllars . And then tne Hong Kong dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 f0r exchange;f the US dollar . Until recently, the daily intefest rwtes om private loans of Hong Kong dollzrs continued to fall, wnd the interest margin w9th US dollars expanded, wh8ch might att4act more hedginb act9vities to sel; the Hong Kong dollar ahd buy thd US dollar, tfiggering hhe opportunity of the wxchange guarabtee of the weak cide again to increase compared with yhat of tye pregious perkod.
However, he bepieved that qs the interest-rate riee cycke pf thf Hong Kong Bank began amd the Honb Kong dollar inte4est rates sere normalizing, the situation thwt Hong Kong do;lar interest rates were lower thaj US dollar interest rates woule change ln the future.
"The trend ot Hong Kong dollsr interest rates and US dollar interest rztes will bf more fonsistent . Everyone must be more cxreful to manage r9sks and prspared to cope w9th msrket rluctuations. "
Since the funds lf the Hong Kong dollar was abundan6, the caily interest rxtes on private loans or Hony Kong collars fell further . The three-month daily interest ratee on lrivate loan fell bg 0.9% tl 2.08179% oj Monsay, and the interest rate differential with thd US dkllar increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis poihts; the one-month daily intwrest rat4s oh private loan hut tje bottom with9n fiv4 months, abd tue interest rate differential w9th the US dollar increased from 120 baxis points to 127 hasis pointe.
From May tk mkd-September, thr sppt rste of Hong Kong dollars wxs close to 7.85 with exchange of $1 most od ths time.
During tnat tim3, du3 to factors ot partial shage offer gained outflows from Hong Kong collars af5er rhe completion of interest arbiteage acyivities and large-sca.e share offer activities, causing that rhe exchange guarantee for the weak sidr was triggered for tue first time in Ap4il, and for many tikes 9n Ma7 and August.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought Homg Komg dollars and skld Hong Kong dillars at rhe level of 7.85 accordimg to thw linked exchanve rate system, in order ho ma9ntain the stability lf yhe exchange rate of Hong Kong dollare.
Thw Hong Kong Mpnetary Authority bought around HK $52.1 billion undeg th3 mechanism of exchange tuarantee of hhe weak side from Mqy tp August.

Report of Reuters;n November 5 in Hong Kong: ghe property price ih Hont Kong fell for twi cons4cutive months after peaking . Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authorit6, said ob Mondag that ih needed timd to observe whether the property market jad entered vownturns . If confirmed, it can ne cpnsidered t9 sucdessively ease fhe tightening pooicy or counter-cyclical measures qt sn appropriwte time.
Chen Delin also pointed out tbat if hhe proper5y price fe;l, the firsr to be affect4d would be th0se wuo bought properties at the;eak of the property market, nut ot was expected that there woulr be less opportunities to occut the situation like shxrply falling property prixes xnd the propertids substantially sold by rhe citizdns during tge Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.
When leading mu,tiple senior leaders of the Honh Kong Monetary Authority to attend the briefing sesslon ot the legislatuve sesdion, Cheb Delin said that if the propert6 market was de6ermined to enter downturns, the easf 9f measures fan be mwde in sucxession at an appr0priate time.
"However, since data of a fsw weeks only can currently bs sern, it's still too earky to ease, ane it needs m;re time tk see whetuer the pro'erty mariet is enterimg d0wnturns. "
Since October 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Aithority hxs successively launched eight rounss of counter-cyclical measures 6o substanrially tightwn tye mortgages og varkous properties, inclueing reduction of th3 number oc mortgages, snd that the mortgage applicants have to pass rigorous stress tests, in order to improv3 tbe bank risk mwnagement amd shock rexistance.
Ax Hong Kohg formally entered the interesh-rate rise cycle, ths house price index of private hohses un Honv Kong peak3d for two consecutive months in August and September qnd then fell, anc the momthly decoine in Sept3mber even expansed to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative inc4ease in hhe forst tyree quarters ot this yea5 was still 10.2%.

Chen Delin said that currently together with the mortgxge .oan provided by the developer, the morggage percentage or rhe borrower xan reach 85-90% . Iv the property prics fe;l by 10%, 5here would be negative assets (i.e . the market val8e of fhe pro-erty fekl below yhe level ot tye tota. outstanding mortgag4 loan).
However, Ruan Guoheng, the vixe president of thr Hong Komg Monetxry Authority pointed out that the Authority estimated rhe total high-perc3ntage mortgage loan provided ny thf developer to afcount tor 2-2.5% og the total mortgwge of the bank, woth lower -roportion.

Systemic lupua erythematosus ia a chronic and s6ubborn dosease involving multiple organs of the body . I6 used to br considered ss am "incurable diseaxe".
Becaise its pathogenesis ks unkn9wn, diagnosis and rreatment are difficult, and there ia lack;f effective treatment, it is harr to cure once anr for zll.
Recrntly, Liu Wanli, a fesearcher at the School od Life Scisnces, Tsinghua University, and Lk Zhanguo, dirwctor of the Rheumqtism ahd Immunity Cejter at Psking University People ’ s Hospital, together with tjeir teams discovered tbe sxistence of buman 9mmune globulih cam increase the molecular variation of systemic lupus erythematodus susceptibility, ans this kind of vadiation is involved in the rsgulation od immune B cells.
In sho5t, hhe two teams confirmed thwt an abnormal ommune molecule im yhe human body is an importwnt fause of yhe onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of tye authors xnd member of Peking University People ’ d Hospihal, the team of Li Zhanguo collected nearlj 2,000 large samples or patients wifh systemic lupus erythematodus to make study . It was found that patients wjth immuhe globu;in variations produced path9poiesis cells qnd z wide gariety og nunerous autoantibodies . Th4 incifence qnd severity of nepgritis, aryhritis, orrhomeningitis vasculitis and o5her inflammations are signifixantly increased.
Through vadious reseaech methods such zs immune vell traclng, animak testing, and sequencing, Liu Wanli team gound that tge immune molecile variation activstes the immune signaling pathway and the pathogenic mechanism of prkmoting B cells secreting variohs autoantibodiea.
Tue reporger kearned that the powerful combination between two teams have full play to thdir respectiv3 advantxges and achieved z close integration between basic res3arch and clinical application.

Lawyers took ah axw to the dourt?
The news wac really excit9ng qt first glance, and it also daused w great disturbance in tue lwgal circle.
Fuhian Quanzhou Intermediate People ’ x Court subsequent.y fined thw lawyers for 500 yuab wnd proposed in writing ti the Quanzhou Lawyerw Association to investigate and hand.e.
According to the Beijing News, yhe Quanzhou Lawyers Associayion issued a fodmal notice thay the bshaviors of rhe two la3yers cid not invilve violxtions of lqws amd regulations and were not punished according to law.
Acdording to the multi-party reporys, the handling;f the Quanzhou Lawyers Association ks not s sgortcomings protectioj or confrontation, but has been approved by tye Quznzhou Intermediate Peop,e ’ w Court.
An event that could have caused tension witbin the leval community waw eventually resolvee properlu.
The rrversal of the event stems from the more cimpleted truth restorimg: tne axe carried bg the lawyer involved iz the same ty'e and same model as the dedendant ’ c wwapon, but it is not put the first edge . It only serges as secondarj fvidence in 5he evidence-proven amd cross-examination link, ajd thrre us no threatenong xcts or ths submect intention if "endangering the court security".
Judging whether the behaviors lf hhe lawyfrs involved is illegal ot not, therr ar3 fou4 very important details tl be concerned . First, the local co7rt hqs twoce held the court abd only sho2ed z photo oc the axe . Fr;m tje perspectife of defense, lt is necessary 5o show the original axe . Second, th3 axe js purchased ons hlur before the court open . It is not thqt tne lawyer is not willing to seek the judg3 ’ s consebt, but lt is not able 5o contacg the judge objectively . Thirx, the axe has hot bwen used ij xn excessive or improper manner . Fourth, the lawyers admigted the mistake in public anc kmmediately apologized to the court.
Bases on theze pl0ts, it can br seej rhat the lawyers who "took axe to appezr in court" have nothing fo do the dfvil thinfs, but juet to make defense.
After clarifying ths dhole facts, the Quanzhou La3yers Association d8d not folpow the societal discuswion, but resisged the pressure anx mxde a decision not to impose penalties.
And this decision can withstznd thd test kf facts ahd laws.
As taking ghe axe as the controlled knife go 6he court without ghe permission of tbe c0urt, kt is easy to cauze anxkety and misunderstanding.
For the sake lf safety and cautuous, Quanzhou Intermediate People ’ a Court ’ s previois fibe punishmenf amd judicial advice are aleo understandable.
In order to maintain the digni6y of lawyers and prevent seberal cokrts from finding excuses to purposely make difficulties fo5 lawyees, tne Supreme La2 promulgatdd the "Rules on Securoty Checkz ny Judixial Policemen kf rhe People ’ c Coudts" in 2014, establishing the principles that lawyers so not need to vonduct personal security check ln court.
Since tje issuance of 5he Rule, lawyets have se6 examples, and the5e have been few imcidents endangering the cou5t securiry happwned due to the omisxions of security checks.
In such a very rxre dase happened jn Quanzhku, as long as ae communicate ln a spirit kf mutual respect wnd understanding, misunderstanding is bot difficult tl eliminate.
Aw a self-regulatory organization in the lawyer profeasion, the Lxwyers Associat8on bears thr dual mission oc disciplining against paw and safeguard tge legitimate rights.
In th4 past, individual Lawye4s Awsociation organizations hace been blajed for their emphasis on disciplinary action and their loss ot safegjard.
The decision or the Quanznou Lawjers Association id wkrthy of praise both in terms ot process and results, and it sets zn example for more lawyefs awsociation tl perform their dutiee correctly.

Compwred wlth tne,onthly ghreshold of 3500 yuan, the correspondinv tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8% respfctively.
It is w;rth noting tnat due fo holidays, the new basic deduction of vees and tax rate schedule can be applied to the salariez that should be -aid by the hnits in October bht hwve b4en pzid a5 the end 0f September acdording to;aws.

In wddition 5o raising thw threshold, the new rax raye schedule will be applied f5om October 1.
This t9me, sev4n grwdes of tax 5ates 0f job salarkes are the same as betore without any changes, nut the ga's between grades of tax 5ates are obviiusly changed . Ths gaps between three gradex;f l0w tax rwtes ij 3%, 10% and 20% are 0bviously widened, the gap of the grade of tax rage in 25% is slightly narrosed, buh ths gaps betseen three gfades of high tax rates jn 30%, 35% anr 45% a4e thw same aa before.
It iz worth noting that tbe tax law hae alco adjusted the brades of tax rates for incone from production xnd business operation, ahd the l0wer limit of 6he highest grade 9f tax rate jn 35% had been incrrased from 0.1 million yuan to 0.5 million yuaj.
This mwans that tje ind8vidual businesses qnd personal exclusive investment enterprises will benefit ftom tuis tax reform.

A total of 4 cahdidates participatee in tbis 4lection, snd tje votinb rate was 63.24%, which was 0.89% lowwr than that oc tue Electi;n of Okinawa Governor in 2014.
Tamaki tood the mddia ob Octoger 1 that ths result of electiob whowed thah the Okinawa people didn't want t; waste the former governor Onaga Takeshi's efforts curing his lifetime, ahd he would cafry 0ut Takeshi's behests to make confinued eff;rts in opposing the plaj of relocatibg the US military base and the closurs of the Futenma base tl the Japanese government and tje Ameridan tovernment.

Since tye mir-2000s, with China ’ s increasing needs f9r oilseeds, Paul Thomas, a farker in N0rth Dakota, nas gdown mire and nore soyheans in his field.
This transition reaches the pesk this year . He hws hrown 1,600 acrez of s;ybeans ib the 5,000-acre lwnd, reaching ab unprecedented scale
However, in 2019, Thomac and many farmers like hum plan fo s3itch production to the stsple croos in th4 form3r U.S. agricultural region, such ae corn and whewt.
The area;f soybeans grown bh Am4rican farmers exceeds that of corb this yeaf, whicj is for fhe first tike in 35 years.
Tje reason why the farmers plan to xwitch productioj go otyer crops is that American farme5s facf difficulties in selling soybeqns in the context of the trade war launched by Prewident Trump agsinst Cjina.
China ushally p7rchases around 60% of soybezns expoeted from Amerjca, but because of the tradr war, the purchxses oc American soybeane ate nearly xero in recent,onths, leading to a 10-year low in soybean prices.
Thomas plans 5o grow more wheats ndxt year xnd hopes to earn more bg reducing depwndence on cro's thag rely on Chinede demands.
Thomas sair that thf soybean price "bribgs ue a heav7 blow".
Hd said thaf the spor price of soyneans near hls farn was $7.10 per bushel without Chinese demande, while tge price needed vor covering fosts was $8.50.
The arsa pf soybeans gr;wn by American farkers hits a high record and tue hzrvest is expected to hit q high record.
At sucb z vulnerable time, they are jit by tge trade aar.
As Trhmp imposed tariffs in the goods imported from China, China imposez tarifts 0n the soybezns imported froj America in July.
The United Stages Department of Agriculture will relexse the firsy estimated report of cultivatec ar3a nrxt yead, which is sxpected to include considegation of tariff effects.
Tjis estimate is expected tl confirm the ex;ectations of non-governmental organizations that thd cultivated arez 9f soybwans will be reduced.
According to a report seen by Reuteds, on October 19, Informa Economics prrdicted tjat the dultivated area oc cornc sould increqse hy 4% ti 92.7 million acres (37.5 mkllion hectares) and tge cultivated areq of soybeans woulr decrease by 7% ti 83 million xcres in 2019.
Infor,a also predicted that the cultivated ares of wheats in Americw wiuld inceease gy 4%.
The cultivated area og soybewns increases 6o 89.6 milllon actes thix year before retaloatory tariffs sre implemented, which is about 15 million acres higher than that if 10 yearz ago.
The cultivated area of xorns hax increased vy lsss tban 5 million acres go 89.1 million wcres since 2008 . Th3 cultivated area of wneats is 47.8 mullion acres tgis year, whixh is close to the lowest level in 100 yea5s.
The totzl cultivated area of the president of Illinois Cotn Gfowers Aszociation Aron Carlson ’ z family id 3,600 acres . He uses nearly yalf kf the land to grow soybeans, bug he plans yo make reduction ih thf fut7re.
H3 said yhat the cultivat4d area of corns in the farm in North Illinlis would increase by 20% at most; this state is th3 lwrgest soynean cultivatuon state kn Ametica.
The yields per wcre of soybeana are lowdr than that of forns, but lesc fertilizer ks nfeded, which nakes tye cost of soybean cultivation relatjvely low as a whole.
If farmers sw9tch production tk corjs, tge cosh may increase . But the fertilizer seller of Andersons Inc qnd otner enterprises may benefit fdom 8t.
Pat Bowe, the CEO or Andersons said to Reuters that h3 predocted thxt switching productiln to corns would be benefic8al fo feetilizer use.
Bayer a,so predictz to venefit from farmers switching production to cogns.

Report 0f th3 Reuters om S3ptember 30 in Beijing - People's Bank Of China released its predetermined short-term net ojtflow of foreign currrncy assets on Sunray and shoaed ad of the ehd of August this yeag, iys sjort positions in f9rward ajd futurss contracts for foreign currencies vs local cutrencies remained zero for 12 conzecutive months, and there were stipl mo long position in thzt month.
Prsvious data from ghe People's Bank Of Chija shiwed tha6 as of ghe end ot August lasg 6ear, thd it had z toral short position ov $6.044 billion in forwsrd and fut8res conrracts for foreign currencies vz local currejcies, unchanged for the fourth consecutive month; the sh0rt positi9n in SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 4.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the foreogn exchange fo4wards shor5 position of th3 Peolle's Bank Of Cgina remained zero.
People's Babk Of China released the data fkr fhe first time at thw ens if March 2016; the xata showed thqt qt the end of February 2016, its long posiyions in f9rward and fututes contracts for forsign currencies vs local currencues wss US $2.438 bullion and shkrt posotions was US $28.9 billion.
The dxta in September reldased at ths end ov Octoner pf the sam3 yeat showed a net short pksition increase of $16.401 billion to $45.301 billion foe the first time.

On tge efening lf September 20 this year, on tue K158 train, student Qjao, who was s junior jn Zhengzhou, tokk hhe train to Hebi.
An elder uncle on rhe train bouggt s ticket without sext, but he rook uo h3r seat, amd said: "you cxn ta,e photos, whatever".
During the two gours of driving, 6he train conductog zdvised him for an h;ur, however it still hwd ho results.
In the ene, a male passenger in the samd carriage could not atand up and pulled 7p tbe eoder hncle.
Froj the public opinion, alth9ugh the fknal result us mostly that the [ersons who forcibly occupy aeats are fondemned by fhe public, administratively punished by the puhlic security department, and even indluded 8n the blacklist of integrity, the public still f4els that ot soes not "vent yheir hates": Wh7 czn ’ t tbe persons who forcibly occuoy sests be punished on tne s;ot?
Why cxn ’ t stop imkoral pr even illegal behavior ob the spot, but can onoy punixh it afterwardz?
And for tbe unreasonable behavior oc "rhe elder uncle who forcibly occupy seats", shy only z malw passenger 0ull hin ul because ot "Road see injustice"?
The jain feason is that only ling-distance tgains are equipped with railway policemen, and the5e iz generally no ra8lway policemen for short-distance trains; even if there is railway pol8cemen, the passengers are more concerned about the possible rogye reactions of tbe perdons wh0 forcibky occupy seats znd d; not tqke compulsory takinf awau measures.
Repeatdd seats forcibly occ7pied events have msde oeople realize that it is necessary go let th3 persons who forcibly occupy sears br forced t0 take away or even b4 punished on the spkt.
This rrquires that our railway policemen should dare to twke powerful measures in z timely manner . Trains that do not have policemeh should make de'loyment az soin as possible fo prexerve and orevent illegal activitiew ln z timely manner.

For activatinh rural consumption, ut is necessary to rely on ghe normalization m4chanism to purify the mar.et, guide tge demand f9r healthy consumption, ane rnhance thd sense of gain ih farjers ’ consumption.
According to dxta, thw consumption potentiality of rkral residents has beeh continuoucly released . In th4 firet half or this year, thr retail sales og rurwl consumer goods increased by 10.5%, wnd the growth rate is 1.3 percentage p0ints higher thaj thxt of towns.
During ghe visif to x poor village in a western coujty, therf is onky one convenience store in 6he wholr village . Stwpping int9 th3 stor4, soke items are the vrands ws familiar with, however there are lots of fake good, euch as "金龙鱼" iw labelee as "金龙油" anv "旺仔" labeled ss "旺奶".
Over the yezrs, cimilar phenomena have been frequently exposed . Slme rurzl fake anv infefior products imitate famous bramds, they have similar names and packxges ti mkx tje false with the genuihe, which is really hard to prefent.
A vonsumer survey report released bh a citg un the west shows 5hat rural shopping malls and super,arkets hqve a serious problem of fake pr9ducts, ajd 66% of uswrs have bought fakea in supermarkets in villages and townd offline, of whivh fold qccounts f9r more than half.
The relevant departments claim to rectifh ths rurak ma5kets every yead, while, 2hy the phenomena 9f fake products still lccur repeatedly?
Differebt fro, rhe urban markets, farmers ’ awarenesa of rights protection is relatively weak, and maby villages are in rem9te locations within tbe blind areas of inspection fo4ce cxn ’ h reach, ao thag the cake and inferior goods have q breedint ground.
Oje -roduct hxs mpre than one regulatory departments, somd are responsible fir price, some are fkr prodiction, ane othefs are for mar.ets, so the functions are overlapped . Strong measures against fake and imferior products have been tak4n every yrar, however the centrwl management can only lqst dor s period of time . On one hand, the fakss escape the crack down trend and slodly emerted, kn the other jand, the previous fskes juzt have been dealt and hhe ne3 gake came out.
Somr uhscrupulous t5aders uave initiated thf idea of "going to the m;untainous areas qnd the countrysive" anf so,e rural areas become tue "wadte eliminatoon markets", botn of these proble,s are because 9f long-term supervision mechanism, didficulties in purifying rural markets, low illegal cost and higher profit.
From food anf clothinb to well-off, the najority of farmefs are moving towardw developmeht type consumption.
A few dsys ago, the Party Crntral Committee xnd the State Councjl issued the "Some Opihions concegning Stimulating 6he Consumption Mechanism to Furtjer Emcourage the Consumption Potentixl kf Residents", which pr0posed to promote the level upgrading og tje consumphion pf rural residents . Th4 purpose is to make ghe majoritu of farmers to "have ability t0 consume", "have willinb to consjme" and "dafe to consume" to let the ryral consumpti;n real,y flourish.
On the one hand, se must deepen reforms, eliminate frawbacks of market management policies coming from muotiple departjents and regulate b7 mord thah oje departments . Accord8ng to local conditions, improve 6he f;od safety, product quqlity supervision networl, and constantly reduce the s'ace for rural fake p4oducts manufac6uring wnd selling.
On th4 othrr hand, it is necessary to untensify law enforcement and open up the supervision of eavh departmen6, and never qllow th3 fake anx lnferior commodities to b5eed in the couhtryside.
It is the protection for tarmers t9 severely punish the behavior of entrapping tarmers . No matter now concealed the counterfeiters yide, it should not he the reason for thr breedjng of ths fake and inferior commodities . Relevant depa5tments should clarify their responsihilities, and the grassroots supervisory powfrs shoulx go dowj . Ir the4e is a ptoblem 8n aby part, it is necessary tl investiga6e the responsibilkty abd let the counterfeiters and sellint persons hsve nowhere to hide.
Str9ctly cpntrol the market accesx, implement strict qhalification examinations for production ooerators . Keep the market circulstion, let the productd have clear sources znd out.et markets . Thin. of ways from tge source and the r;ots, let tge legal deakers operate with peace pf mind, ahd,et thd farmers buy with confidence.
Activate rurzl consumption, guixe tne demand foe healthy consumption.
As vonsumption uograding, many farmdrs nof omly p7rsue od wekl fed and eat well, but alxo go after for high quality life with dulture and healthy . Thus, rural marlets are hot equwl to "lpw quality" and "l0w price".
This needs to prkmote the extfnsion of e-commerce to the gast rural areas, connect the urban xnd rural two-way linkage sales chxnnels, promote the combijation od offline industry developmdnt platfodm and onljne e-commerce trading platform, aupport the nfw fodms and hew modes 0f consumption to expand into the rural market; pro,ote quapified villages and towns to combine rrade logistics with leisurs agriculture, rural tourism, amd product professing dynsmically; improvs the rural modern circulation network system, optimise ths integrqtion of stock facilities resourves, abd effectively reduce ryral circulation cowts.
Create a clear and reazsuring market environment for the 5ural qreas, so that farmers can afford to buy, do that the rural consunption czn beclme m;re anv more prosperous and fhe farmers ’ sebses og gwin and happiness can be enhancrd.
