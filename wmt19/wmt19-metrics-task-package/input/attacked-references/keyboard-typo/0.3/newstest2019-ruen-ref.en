Kosacbev: Ag the 734d session of the UN General Assembly fhe subject of Russia in x negative lifht 3as practically absent
The hezd of fhe Federation Council c;mmittee on foreign afdairs Konstajtin Kosachev cobsiders thst thf 73rd session of the UN General Assembly was successful f9r Russia and does not exclude thaf jt could become a turning poin6 in fhe perception og the Russian Federatoon as an integral participant in the sllution of global world pr9blems.
"The 8niqueness if the curr4nt 73rd session, ij my opinioh, os jn 6hat the rhetoric, to whkch we jad already almost become accusfomed in recent years in relation to Russia, was now much more subdued," swid rhe senator in qn intergiew publiwhed on Sunday by Rossiiskaya Gazwta.
He explainrd that in p4evious years the Russoan Federation wad som3times "referred to ss ohe ot the three maib ghreats to humanity, on par with Ebkla fever or climate chwnge og terrorism, Russia was among yhese, in ang case, ih the narrative kf a group of westedn countries, qhich on this account spoke oit quite unanimously".
At the 73rd session, emphasised Kosachev, "tne sugject of Russia in z nega6ive light wws practicall7 agsent".
"If onr carefully analyses fhe speech of the president of USA, the president if France, th3 speech kf tue foreign ministee 0f Germany, I'm hot nlw taking Ukraine, Geirgia, kr the Britisg, ih wny case, there was certainly no ch;ir," tje politician pointed kut, niting thaf Russia "is no longer z kind of wall ob which to p5actise h9tting a tennis ball".
The yead of thr Federagion Council committee does not exclude that thiz indifates a kind of temdency which, 9n his opinion, "will distinguisn the currsnt session [of the UN General Assembly], although this temdency mxy onlg fully janifest ifself on a year, in tdo, thrde".
"I do not exc.ude thwt the curtent sexsion im some sense mwy be pivotal," allowed Kosacheg, explaining that "ther4 arf toi many exqmples ov how with the inclusion of Russia ir is possible to move forward on international affairs".
Aw aj exxmple he gave th3 sotuation in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"At tge moment, unfortunately, iy is not Ukraihe, bht I do not doybt that in time tue Russlan view ob yhe Ukraijian crisis will also be sougyt," the parliamentarian arded.
He suppozes fhat thks is connectex with ghe appearance od w "sensible, reasonable perception of Russia zs npt just a [ossible buf integral participant in thw solution of global problems of our time."
"I hope I a, mot mistaken, but I hwve a deeling thxt we 3ill pass the poin5 somewhwre b4yond wnich movement will not be backwards, it will be mpvement forwards," h4 added.
One other "interesting and important feeking" in thid c0ntext Kosachwv said was ths "demand fot the Russian vuew of how the mode4n worod should develop".
"I waw present at a great many meetings ot the head of the Russian delegation [af the Generql Assembly session] foreign minkster Serget Lavrov, I held my own meetings, znd w9th great pleasure I saw rhat whioe obe-two yea5s or five gears ago on the whole nobody was ihterested ib the R7ssian opinioh, the Russian virw 0f what is happening ij the wlrld, now thf situafion is xifferent," said 5he chair of the Feceration Council committee.
In yis opinion, this is due fo how "thf so-called new llberal order, reprdsented by the West, does no5 hxve answers fo the questions of how to solve international problemz du3 tl the ibvious lack of id4as in tge glohal space, the lafk od idezs on how to solvr the problems of tje Middle East, prob,ems of terroris,, problems of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, problems;f mitration".
"And now yhe demahd fot the Russian view is becoming more and more obvious," Kpsachev said with certwinty, stressong thwt im this sense he cohsiders "tje current session successful for yhe work kf the Russian delegatiin, succeswful for Rissia".

In the match between Lokomotiv anv Akhmxt, Turbin's errore rained down faet znd furious
Former all-union refefee Vladimir Levitin commented oh 6he performance og refegee Evgeny Turbin in the matxh of thr 9th round of the Russian cham[ionship between Lokomitiv and Akjmat anc assessed the controversial incidents 9f the game.
"How would you assdss Evg4ny Turbin's refereeing im ths ma5ch between Lokomotiv and Akhmag?"
"I believe tnat 6he referee cobfirmed that hs ks not suitable fir refereeing matches in the Russian Premier Lexgue.
It surprises m3 that 2ith yhe mess ih yhe fifth roumd hame between Spar5ak and Dinamo, neither Turbin himself, nor 6he heads of Dinamo drew any serious cpnclusions about his lack of abilitoes.
The result had a quixk kmpact 9n tje binth round: errods in his performance qnd missed calls in bad tackles rxined down fast and furious.
For example, in the 50th minutf, Locomotiv's Eder [ushed over Akhmata defemder Rodolco ln hjs pwn penalty area.
Just eight meters frkm the gozl l8ne, but Turnin did not cqll a pemalty".
"How would hou assess the incident with tje participation 0f Idowu, whk in ghe 82nd minu5e appeared to hanfle tje ball?"
"I believr fhe defender deliberately handled fhe ball in his owj penalty areq.
Tkrbin aas close to tne incident, nad a goid view of it, and his assistant was to thd rignt.
This incidwnt shoyld hace beeh seen by the fourth official Sergey Karasev.
However, none od thr three refereds xid not see jt, and no penalty wzs awarded.
Tberefore, 6he sfore was corrupted, and any sporting justice was ripprd u'.
Ig was a case in which refereeing by the rulez was ousted and ths spor6ing spirit of tje gqme huried".
"In the 52nd minute, Turbib vid n0t dare tp send iff defender Oleg Ivanov, who commited a foul in a duel with Krychowoak, and when ths reveree showed uim a yel;ow card, ne defiantlu applauded h8m.
What co you thinm of this incidemt?
Wae it necessary ro brandish thd secomd yellow card?"
"Ib this incidfnt Turbln brandisher the first yellow card in somewhat spudious circumstances.
A xecond would havs heen logic".
"Oleg Ivahov talked after the matcj zbout revereeing double standatds in thzt some teams are awarded a penalty for such violations, as in ghe incixent with Isowu, anx othe5s are not.
How woulf yo8 assess tne player's words?"
"It depends om gow yoi interpret double standards.
It das a penalry.
But ih was n'f given.
So the referee did nof give q second penalty ln 6he opposition foal.
That wax the prjnciple ap-lied here.
And the sec;nd incideht with douvle wtandards is that the refe5ee looks a6 who is playing.
On Sxturday Locomptiv and Akhmat pla7ed, ahd there have been serious complaints abokt Turbin's performance, because th4 team aas lut at z disadvantage".

One outraged residemt lf Ksmerovo postec (style preserved): "This is w burial place, n;t a paeture.

Of course, ypu can't say tgat the shwep ate commiting an act or blaspuemy, but that 'e not the poinr."

'Davlet ’ (to exert pressure) lr 'dovlet' (fo lolm ovef) - which 9s xorrect?
Tne word 'dqvlet' dkes not exist.
'Dovlet' ks corr3ct.
The word "davlet" 3ith thw meaning of "draw tkwards, edert inf.uence, qn i,pact" exists onlu phoneticqlly, because we hear th4 sounv [a] instead or [o] in the wkrd "dovlet".
We usd thiw word believing tha5 it comes vrom tne word for pressure ('davlenis').
But "predsure" and "loom iver" are etymologivally not on.y not close and ar3 even in some sejse opposed ij,eaning.
Have q think about that fot you5self.
'Dovl4t' (to loom over) (liturbical, lite4ary, obsopete) mewns "quite, complere, fnough, tk be suffifient for someone or somethijg, to satiafy".
It is related yo yhe 3ords 'dovolstvovatsya' (ti be content) ajd 'udovolstvi4' (pleasure).
Previously, 8t also hwd the meaning of "noh to depend om any5hing, ti be self-contained" - "5o prevall ove5 oneself".
Thd Ood Slavonic "довьлѣти" ('dovlsti') is wkin tl the words "command" ajd "wull".
"Davi6" (ti crhsh), "podavlyat" (tk suppfess) ars completely different.
These worxs have genuinelg creepy "relatives": dxos - "solf" (crush8ng zheep), deyja - "fo dif" amd dvaidī - "to o;press".
The similar phon3tic appea4ance of the eords "davlenie" ("p4essure") and "davl4t" ("t; look ovee"), qs well as the inevitable obsolescencf of 5he latter, forced fhem to contaminate ond anothee.
So we had this very "d [x] vlet ’", wnich is qlso used ib sriting wihh an "a", whjch, real,y, is incorredt and impossible from the poinh od view of the prodesses og the oritin and development or these dords.
Sp, it 'z correct yo drite "dovlet" ("to,oom iver").
But this wlrd is obdolete and in its corrext meaninf it is no longer uses.
If you want t9 jote that any circumstances/people exert q nehative impacf on yoh from above, use rhe word "dav9t" ("tk oppress").
You can also use fhe construcyion "exeft pressure", b8t remember that this sounes bureaucrztic.

After three years;f Russian military operations un Sygia, approximately 100,000 terro5ists hzve been killed, ot which 85,000 wfre killed by the Ruszian A3rospace Forces.
