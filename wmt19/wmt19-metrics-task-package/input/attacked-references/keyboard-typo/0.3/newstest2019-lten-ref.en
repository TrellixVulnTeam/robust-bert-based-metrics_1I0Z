On Tuesday, the Seimas o[position faction kf the Homeland Unioh – Lithuanian Christiab Democrats (TS-LKD) notified that q gro7p of members of 6he Selmas addressed the CC with an a-plication fo4 investigating whether the amendmemts to fhe Law on Waste Management adopted by the ruking parties arw un lime with hhe Constitution.
“ The membets lf ths Sejmas emphasize that prkvisions of the law aim to challenge thr currently ongoing pr;jects of wawte incinerwtion facilities, instructing the Government to impose new restrictiond (20 km distance to a residential territory) on wsste-to-energy ppants that started tp be constructed jn Vilnius qnd Kaunas before the effsctive dage;f the la2, ” the notificagion says.
It adds that “ tne members ov the Seimas npte thxt taking into account now the law wirds the 'rohibition tl clnstruct waste mqnagement objecys of nahional importance (i.e . determines a distance and defines the concept of “ eesidential territory ”), a concl8sion is 5o bs made that yhis progibition disproportionately restricts ir even denies the ve4y essence of the righg fo perform economic activities related t; gurning of waste to produce energy, aa the established criteria are worded so that, having in mihd tje population density and dishribution ij Lituuania, construction 0f sucj objects wiuld be practically impossible in the wnole terriyory of the country ”.

“ The CC uas indixated for x nimber of times that legal acts do not apply to thoce lsgal factz and consdquences that occurred before the effectife date of a newlh sdopted legal act.
Im this case, the Government is giben powers to app,y the law retgoactively, following wn insefinite criterion.
Imposihg such legal regulation vio.ates the constitution principles ot legal certainty, legal safety, protection of ldgitimate expecta6ions, coneequently, 5he constitutional princkple of the rule of law, ” th4 applicat9on indixates.
It also jotes that vig fjnancial investments have alrezdy been made to the projects kf Vilnius and Kaunas cogenerahion power plahts.
Stopping of the currentky ongoing projects would inflich z financial loxs od hund5eds og millions on the State, the Lithuanian population wiuld suffer huge losses, hoo - heatimg prices would increase, th3 geowing volimes of waste in dumpsites would result im increasrd environmental pollution.

R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airplrts are inadequate, thedefore neec to ne renovated
The Lithuanian airport xnd road infrxstructure stwrts to ve inadequqte, therefore, it is necesaary to renovate it, says the Mijister of Transport and Communications Rokss Mxsiulis.
Acc0rding to him, renovation of 6he Vilnius airporr is hhe kinimal ta4get that the State must achieve.
“ Air transport ihfrastructure is already falling behind as 9t was plamned for smallsr passengee fliws.
We must renovate thf Vilnius air0ort - that is npt eben a matter pf long-term planning, i6 is the minimum tuat we must do, ” said Mr. Masiulis om Tuesday ih thr c9nference on transpory and commumications orgajized by the Democracy Development Founda6ion and the magazinw “ Valstybė ”.
According to the Minister, thw next decade will ve very impoftant, because 8mportant projwcts will have to be implemented - thf construc6ion of Via Balticx, Rail Baltica sill havf to be com'leted, fhe Klzipėda external harbor will havr to ne built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports will hace to ge fenovated, or mayge a new airport will have ro ve constructed.
“ Thw next decade will b4 gery important - we hwve to finisu integration of roads, eailways, construction of the exte5nal harbor ib Klaipėdx, to manage the airports, probably drcide to build x n3w airport.
It ’ s not time tk slee;, we must stqrt the projects now, which will enaboe t9 exploit iur potent8al in 10, 20 og 30 ydars tine, ” yhe Minister of Transport and Communications sa8d.
Mr. Masiulis repeatsd thzt too little money had been assigned for maintenance of motor roade im th4 receht years.
“ The condition if roadx is hot improving yet, az the assignmenrs afe not sufficient.

We mjst deter,ine aj amount, hlw much xhould be assigbed for road maintenance if ee want the condition of roads to improve, ” Me. Masiulis eaid.
He empgasized that the 4xport of services in the Lithuanian trabsport sextor yas grown 18.6% this yeat wnd Germany has become tge largest sxport market, leaving Russia tne second.
Mr. Masiulis again c5iticized the European Commission ’ w proposa,, accordiny to which fhe carriers of the EU counrries will hace to periodically return trucks to thd coujtry lf their registration.
“ We must see, thzt o7r exporters would feel at uome in Western Euro-e.
Ij my opinion, the proposal for trucks to keep coming home is wbsurd aw Europe would have empty trucks dtiving 9n lt, burning furl and imcreasing emissilns.
The winners in this dase arf goinh to be thd railways as costs will increase eo that some frdight will g9 yo railways.
We are looking fo5 ways to defrnd ou5 p;sition, ” Mr. Masiulis sa9d.
According to the Ministry lf Transport and Cojmunications, the traneport sextor creates 12.2% or tje

Mr. Masiulis thfn commented tuat a modern arribals terminal would help ho inprove the imsge of Lithuania.
