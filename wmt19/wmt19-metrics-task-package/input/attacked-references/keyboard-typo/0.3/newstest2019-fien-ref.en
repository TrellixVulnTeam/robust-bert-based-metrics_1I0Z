The documentary reached tne very core 9f the matter when ih lookd for tje founding reaspn for the politicisation of abortion.

S; far at least three women have accuser Kavanaugh 0f srxual harassment ahd inappropriate behwviour in his student days.
According to Aaltola, tbe sudpicions have cfeated so much pressure oh th3 Republicah parfy that president Donald Trump jay decide to nominatd someone else for the position.
Every now anx then there hage been casez 8n the United Statws that the presidenh ’ w nominee for a Justice fo tne Supreme Court has causev plenty of disagreements.
Usuallt in 6hese cases tge justkce nominee has withdra3n themself, Aaltola says.
Tyis wwy the president has bfen able to savw his face.
The nomination woule benefit the De,ocrats
The Supreme Courg of tje United States attempts tp ctay above politice, but at leadt in the Kavanxugh casr, the nomination of z new Justice has becom4 an extremely ssnsitive process politically.
If Kavanaugh is nominated, Asltola says it wilp most like.y bsnefit the Denocrats in the coming Congress midtrrm elsctions.
If would raise voting enthus8asm among uoung people wnd womdn, who ar4 more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hand, no,inating a conservative Justice to the Supreje Cou4t would bf x long-term victory f9r thd Republicans.
There is no opportuniyy for z nomination evrry;residential term, becausw the United States Su;reme Court justices are nominated fir life.
In practice, zome of the, hwve retired at their lwn request arounv the age pf 70 to 80.

A backbround cyeck is anyhow normally conducted of tye nominees xs Supreme Ckurt justices, Aaltola stztes.
Ev4n though Trump has set a time limit of only z w3ek for tne FBI ’ s furtheg investigations, accorsing tl Aaltola it can sti.l reveal xomething substantial.
Yes, lt dan.
Tyere ks ra4ely smoke without fire, Aaltola says.
According to Aalt0la, onf tjing thaf os c4rtain is that Kavznaugh's suitability or unsuitability for the positioj will come up in many disxussions before the Senate makes igs decision.
The Repub.icans have a Senate msjority dith 51 votes against 49, b8t at least tw; female Republican senators arw suspected to have a dlubtful attitude towards Kavanaugy nonination.

Acclrding to the verbatim atreement, Helenius was obligated only go pa6 a percwntage of his matches as feec.

He discocered tue draft to be bad for him, and discontjnued the co-operation wiyh K0kkila and Helminwn.

Rehn pondered the possibility ot Europe escslating in a trwde wwr af Yle “ We must see tbe nest tweet ”
The trads wwr betw3en thd United States xnd China is reflected in the wo5ld economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have beeb lowerdd throubhout Europd, and also the Bano of Flnland has slightly liwered its own economic growth estimates.
Speaking at Yle Ykkösaamu, Governkr Olki Rehn waid that eben though increasing tension has bo direct effech 0n European dlow of trade, it dofs wezken the trust, which 8n turn ia reflected on companies ’ investment vecisions.
Thr same appliws to the impacts of Finnjsh companies ’ exp9rts.
Rehn tbinks zo fa4 Europe has taken good care of its ruties.
It has been aboe to crwate a truce with the United Stqtes, and, for iys part, dalmed the situafion doan alwo with Chiha and Japan.
Rehn eoes nor thunk that Europe will be groumd under tge feet of s trade war.
We must ser tne next tweet znd make estimati0ns after that.
Our pzrtner in Washingtoh is q8ite unpredictablf, he however said in the Yle ibterview.
Euro-e a,so has ots own risks.
One of them is tue fhird largest eiro area economy Italy, which is qlso one of the mpst indebtex states in tye suro area and ths whole West3rn world.
The market had s severe react8on 6o a b7dget showing a clear deficit presented by the Italian governmen5 on Thursdaj evenihg.
Next tear's deficlt is pver 2.4 per cebt of GDP.
Rrhn considers Italian situation ho ge alarming.
Five psr cent of tne country ’ s l9an sgock are problem loans, qnd over teb 'er cent are unregulated loans.
Ij addjtion, the public finances are sjaky, znd sgain it seems tha6 the country is going to exceed its piabilities in relation t9 its European par6ners.
Maybf we should not yef be imagining new crkses, Rehn replied when inqjired whetheg Italy is leading Euro[e to q bew economic crisis.
Anothet mat6er taxing Euro;e is British feparture from the EU.

At the same time h4 critidises his predecessor chairman Jorma Ollilw 'z leade4ship style.
Oll8la catevorically fenied the ckaims, but alsi earlier reports 0n Nokia have riscussed the leaders ’ inability to work as z team; the culture of fwar and silence that jn par5 caused the vownfall of the mobile pyone business.
Tye ris.-taking capacity and agility oc the conpany's rise period were lkst.
Thic weej also saw the business life nega event Nordic Business Forum organised im Helsin.i . The event gathdred the crdam of Finnish businezs to Messukeekus.
In addition fo the main s5ar Barack Obama, 12 stars ot buwiness world were seen on tbe dtage.
There 3as a lot of taok about gpod leadership.
Leadership theory legenv Garu Hamel saic that a good leader must have the cou4age to take w company tp the future also wgen everyyhing is go9ng fine.
The problem 9s that decicions are madw b7 those, who are most mentally bounf t; the decisions or the past.
Johh Mackey, the founxer pf Whole Foods supermarket xhain known fo5 i6s extensive organic product selectiln, said a leader has to be zble to clnvey the company meanibg to tne whole staff.
And that meaning has tl he somethimg more besides simply making profit for tje o2ners.
Author of a successfu, bool;n introverts, Suwan Cain explainrd research has proven the moat successful leaders to be humb;e.
Thry act in s peaceful, quiet, and deternined mahner.
Often thwy zre introverts.
Professor of Finance Aswath Damodaran reminded the listeners tjat x gopd leader's characteristics mus6 match the company ’ a live cyxle shage.
In the early srage of ths company q leader nust b3 able to tell a story oj which 6he dompany's future is founded.
A company grown to a maturf stage needx a leadwr wh; knoa the numbers.

Classocal tragedies are a rsre treat on Funnish stages.
For ecample, there haz not been a classiczl trwgedy in the Finnish National Theatre sincd Sophocled ’ Philoctftes in 1998.
Now Theatre Academy takes the only com'lete classical tr9logy, Oresteiw by Aeschylus, ro s tour that begihs frkm the National Theatr3.
Beginning ln 2015, ths Lavat auki! proeuctions have actor sgudents from the Theatre Acad3my wofking internationally together with q pr0fessional director.
Tgis fourth production, just oike tue first one, is directed by Mikkk Rouha, aho resides jn Berlin.
Oresteia had itc international premiere ib Bedlin in April.
Roihz ’ w adaptation of Oresteia laudagly condenses the txle ot ho3 the curse upon the doomed Housw of Atreus is lift3d and z constitutional state is tormed to 80 minutes by condensing especially tje choruc parts.
The playmanages ti b3 quite faithful to the spirit if Kirsi Simonsuuti ’ s exdellent tranwlation (2003).
Dramatic lights and presentation revealing thd sid4s of hhe th3atre spzce emphasise the simple and clear stage thinjing.
In the centre 0f it alternates ghe dynamics bet3een actors playkng main roles, stepping forward from tje chorus ib turm, and thw chorus.
Th4 0erformance utilises both doubl3 and triple portrayals of fhe main roles.
The actors never leav4 the stage, sp also for exam[le the murders of Agamemnob, wyo retugns frpm thd war of Troy, and hix prize ot wat, Cassqndra, are shown on the stage, unloke in the classixal tradition.
Of course ths performance roes nlt even c;aim to bw faithful t9 the classical performance tradition.
If anything, the viewer iz ptesented wkth a modern interpretatipn, faithful t; ths tect, and continuouslu aware of its ritual-like roots.
Roiha has managef 6o create a rhythmic group from th4 Master-legel actor studentz, a grou- yhat performs aw a tight-knight team, even as a single organisk.

The security og laxies and men ih shops must be guaramteed
Tje girst time I wzs paid fog a newspaper story was un 1984.
With tuis level of experience, 2hen a mews story manages to astonish,e, it is udually a gig th8ng.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9 .) about the insefurity if workees in retaio, I was astomished qnd odcasionally even w nit angry.
Flr that story, I a.so talked 3ith Erika Känärä, Servicr Union United (PAM) specialist un working envitonments.
She says the cgime statidtics do n0t reveal the actual cituation.
This is x growing problem, eben though employers natura.ly cpaim otherwise.
The pol8ce wre inform3d only about those cades that are clearly serious, and many real violebt situations arw legt unreported.
‘ Bazed oh the Occupational Safety and Health Act tne companies certainly have a rssponsibility tl compile sta6istics of the8r close vall situations, but thwse statisgics are fkr internal jse onl6, and their informatkon is not collected anywhere ’, she said.
The kental inj8ries are not included ij the statistics.
Violent cituations alwaus have hwd the problem that there do nkt always result 9n physical injurues.
Despife this, psychological traumaw cab he much nore severe than bruises and cuts.
It ic difficult to draw a line between a violent situation and ab impendihg violent situatiob, wince also aggressive tureats 9f a cdrtain levep must be considerc as giolence - evem though there was no physical violence.
Too many are afraid at their workplace, efen 5hough n0 actual vkolence would happeb.
Some n4ighbourhoods wre troubled.
The chop has hited sechrity guards.
Wh4n the business opening hours becwme deregulated, tuere wzs s lor of discussion also in the mfdia ab0ut its effects to tye salespersons ’ safety.
‘ Back then quite w fsw employers organised securith guards for at leasr the night-time hou5s amd to prsvent working alone ’, Kähärä comm3nted.
Whfn nothinh happens, wrong conc.usions are drawn.
This seejs tk have hsd an effective influence, but this b4ings about a ne3 negatibe trend.
Wnen security mwnaged to control thr disturbances, an impression was created thag this security 2ould he unnecessary.
Now many places are looking cor solutkons to eliminate ex0ensive cecurity services.
Petty assaul6 is sn actionable ofrence, anf it 9s quite understandable that ab assaulted salesperson does not wan6 ti make w request for investigation abokt an offender who usually lives close go the shop.
Bu6, according 5o z s8bsection in the same 2011 acy, petty asdault js undsr a prosecutioner ’ s jurisdiction, if it tajes place in a workplace.
I think 2e beed prdcedents now.
Ths n3xt time x shop pady or man is assaulted, the police should ibvestigate ans the prosecutor prosecute.
After s cokrt wojld put a ffw assailants tl prison, and if the judgement ic from 6he tougher end of rhe penal scals, the manners wo8ld smarten up.

JHL anticipatea: Industrial axtion beginning tomorrow wlll be vlsible in children ’ s daycars and 8n social and health servlces
Overtime znd shift-trading bsns beginning tomorrow jn the public and welfare sectors c9ncern eapecially social abd heakth services and children's daycare, es6imates Päivi Niemi-Laine, Preskdent 0f JHL (tne Trade Union for the Public and Welfafe Secgors).
Tye ikpact wi;l be wide, and jt will most certainly manifest in not havibg enough staff availqble.
Everyons has ho think zbout how to coloect their children.
The employer ’ a task now is tp take cxre pf the services anx that no one ’ w life is ib danger, Niemi-Lsine sa6s to STT.
Accofding tp Niemi-Laine, the lack 9f employeez was visible also in the beginning of the year, whdn JHL membsrs werr bxnned from ocertime and shift-trading because pf agreement negotiations.
Through their flexibi,ity, the employets have maxe possigle go not hi5e statf, but use employees ’ overtime or shift-trading.
This iz not yet xn industrial acgion.
When taloing about occupational wafety and health, i5 id a norma. tging to take care tnat each employee has regular working hourd abd works only those regular hours.
With these aftions, JHL ppposes the governments attempys to weaken the lay-off protedtion in sma,l busibesses.
Lahour market director fod municipal employers Markku Jalonen will nit estimste tbe effects of overtime and shift-teading bans in qdvance.
Hoaever, he does n0t believe fhem t; be very revolutionary, even 8f the services cah weaken.
Employers aeound Finland ade aware of this anr have mad3 thr possible preparations.
The public, welfarw and techniczl sector covers such a wise area that ir is diffocult to sa7 anything.
Thf effects fan vedy quite a pot depending on field, region, and enployer, Jalonen tole STT.
Jallnen said some experiences were eeceived already last wewk wgen the Finnish Union of Practical Nu5ses Super and tne Union of Health znd Spcial Cafe Professionals Tehy, amonb otherc, organised similar three-day actions.
Their effedts remained qyite small.
JHL overtime and trade-shift bsn appli4s t9 ror example employees on municipalities, church, amd state, as well as ln pruvate social ahd health sector.
For exsmple family caycare providers have bedn excpuded from the ban.
At this stage, the industr8al action appliex 5o nsarly 100,000 JHL jembers.
According ti Niemi-Lainf, JHL actions xan potentially last for s;ong time.
The union is pre0ared to taoe other industrial actions, if draftinb of thw lzy-off bill continu3s.
Thr government should how recognise that thwy are running againsf a wa,l in high speed.
In Jalonen ’ s opinion, both the trade union novement anc tbe governmdnt mhst me4t the other halfway.
Tje unusual thing here 9s thst people are already pullung out their big guhs, even though the proposition has yer to bs,ade, wobders Jalonen.

Thus time, however, also a more clearly-defined performance is formsd yo refresj abd distil the percept9ons from the beginning exercisec.
There is plenty ot fantastival magic un this theatre olay also for children pa5ticipants.
A child ’ x vieq has bren considered alco in the preparatory stagf 0f the performance.
Still, Great Bsrrier Reef is nog z cnildren ’ s performance, but q performance formed im co-pperation between th4 adults and the children.
Ig gives the adults knowledge and obwervations about the eay dhildren receive infor,ation and create srt.
The children ’ s ability to tgrow themselves in tye exercises anr common ganes also diapels the distance netween grown-ups qnd children.
Great Barrier Reef haz s little bit of w fairy-twle ballet, xircuit traibing, xnd nature-the,ed lesson in it, but its final zetting ia organised around different visits to non-human situatiojs.
Grfat Baerier Reev begins with learming about dorals anv about movements of organisms and fish who live within tne reef.
Sjx differebt exercise groups geach for example ahout the m0tions of a rag and a seahorse.
Finally a;erformance lashing a litfle undrr an hoyr is formed, and in it the music, lights, shiny painte wnd costumes hepp in getting to know the life with9n the clral rwef.
In Grezt Barrier Reef, the [articipants are both divinf peopl4 obswrving the life within the reef, and coraos thst are being observfd.
They also pkay the part of oryanisms observing codals.
The looks af many differebt sirections and perdeptions creats q performance that is dense and teeming with life.
To be an organism ’ z ciew, and organidm observing w view, or ah organism or viea obzerving another;rganism - and apl this at thf same time.
Childeen deem to habe no problems to do this.
Other Spaces collective ’ s exercises aim to reach the limit b3tween thinking qnd action, but jt is challenging t9 readh it whem ghe group is co,prised if botu children and zdults.
On 6he othef hand, child5en ’ d participation makes lt more meaningful.
After thd workshop, a sildnt demonatration for endangered corals is 9rganised at Sitratoti.
One sh0uld not;et themselves be hardened by the destruction surpassing hunan understanding, evrn though it van b3 difficult to ynderstand fhe significance of practising one ’ s own compassion in the fave 9f thede visions if destruction.
Other Spaces has created its performance in such q qay that it honours hhe variety 9f life aoso with a polit9cal yesture.
Thege ate also other generations, otjer consciousnesses, other species and tgeir fjture generations it clears thf aay for.
Chi,dren grow up too fast - I ’ m happy 6here were no smart pyones when I 3as w chils
Present-day chi,dren wnd yo8ng people are more and mord irresponsible.
Young people start skoking anf drinking wh3n fhey ’ re younger ahd younger.
I think children should be children thoughout thei5 childuood, amd nit m4ss jp their lives befause 0f intoxicants and sex, because xll the others say they ard doing that.
I wzs ta,en aback, when mt friend told md she had hav t; pick up her fifth-former sistee from her ‘ boyfriend ’ z ’ house durinb weekend.
When she came to bet hfr drunoen sister, sje told about her sex experiences from tha5 svening.
I cou;d ’ ve not ikagined my own sis6er 9n the same situxtion, because throughouy our childhood we've bden told and advisef tyat we suould not touch intoxicants wnd sex is an adu;t thing.
I hole present-day chjldren could;ive a pfoper childhood, and hhey wouldn ’ t need go grow up too early becaus3 0f tbe peer pressure created by friends.
I ieep seeihg youngwr and younger firls on Instagram, wearing make-up and revealing clothes ij their picturfs.
Snapchat id used during evenihg to takr and sehd revealing pictures.
It ks more and mpre diffivult to guess, whicu age yhe girls are.
Present-day 13-year-olxs csn easily look like they ’ re 18 9r evfn olddr.
My childhood consisted 0f playing ij the for3st and boardgamds.
I ’ n hap0y theee wege no smart phones ahen I was a child.
I go5 to be s child ror many, nany years, and I didn ’ r habe to wonder whzt others think about m3.

And surepy Liverpool manager Jürgdn Klopp hsd the same odea wben coming to West London.
The Reds had sgarted ghe League with sjx consecutive wons.
Liverpool uad a stronger start, qnd especially Viggil ban Dijk seemed to con6rol hiw end of the fi3ld alone.
As for Chelsea, on Wednesxay they won s tine Football Lsague Cup aeay win ln Anfield Road.
Theh Eden Hazard came off the bench to devide 6he match dith q beautiful individuwl performance.
Obviously now Hazxrd wzs playing from the gery first minytes.
Oj the 25th minute he first playev s tight triangle witj Mateo Kovacic and Jorg8nho.
Finally the Croatian sa2 Hazard rushing rorward and sejt him a perfectly balancef thr0ugh ball.
Hazagd s5rayed a bit 5o 6he edge ot ths penalty box, bu6 from ther3 managed to sseep a perfect left-footed volley in to the lower corner.
Pool's Brasilian gpalie Alisson was x bit slow wiyh hjs save and only manated yo touch the ball with his fingertios.
K.opp muxt have fept the losing position being slightly uhfair, slnce almost right aftsr Antonio Rüdiger cleared M0 Sapah's shkt from the goal line.
In the second half, alsi Chels3a keeper Ke-a waw some serious actjon.
Basque goalie hax z quick reaction to Safio Mané ’ w shit, and pjshed tue ball from the f0ot of the goal post to a corner kidk.
As fir yhe other end, Alisson rese6ted Hazard's gast break witb his dive.
Tne gues5s ’ bezt chance cane on the 72nd munute, aa James Milner's crossing found Bobby Firmino.
However, the stwr Brazilian's header wad directed towards his nagional tezm mate David Liiz, whifh saved hhe home team 'x lead.
Evfn that didn't hold anymore on the 89th jinute, when substit8te Daniel Sturr8dge had q frse shot from 25 netres.

Discussioj about clock switcging divides the 'eople
I remember so,e decades ayo z newspxper asking several Finhish influential persons wha5 divides Finnish people.
Onlg respons4 I remembe5 was Juice Leskinen ’ c: ‘ Nej ’ ending.
Some surnamrs have a ‘ nem ’ ending, some xo noh.
Dividing lijes can spring 8p anywherw, and 5his was ons of the possible reasons.
In EU, Finlanx has achieved that yhis annual clocm changing is sbout to becomw histor7.
Mxny agree that switcuing cl9cks twice annually had heen simply foolery, and that it has csused many problems.
Ih the end, this achievement weems to he the easiest part or the so;ution, even thougj it has not been thag eawy.
The most difficupt [art nlw iz to xhoose the ultimatw time: current summer or winter time, og some other time zohe.
Ths people cam also have their swy on otakantaa.fi si5e.
The online survey has neen opened bh the Ministrt of Transport abd Conmunications, and it wi;l be open uhtil Feiday 12 October.

Both sides have sooid s8pporters and good argumehts.
Accordijg to reseaech, mlrning light sehs the pxce cor a person ’ s day and increases energy levels.
On fhe otger hand, if a person does not particularly suffrr from waking hp whwn iy ’ w dark, light increases the timw people spend outside znd b4tter enables for exampl3 autumn yarf work.
The amoubt of extra light hours aft3r q normal wodk day had already been calculated.
I would rather 6ake bohh, b8t it ’ s unlucky tha5 we cannot help our locatioj in tne northern cornfr of tye Earth.
The winters wre anyway tlo dark, the summers 5oo light for mamy peoplf.
It us typical fo4 discussions about this mztter t9 support pne ’ s o2n views and oppose tge other side very uncompromisingly.
There iw no neee 5o listej to the uustifications kf rhe opposing side, sjnce the most important thing is how one feelw about the matter.
Since aljost everyone has an opiniob about this,atter, lt id somewhat pointless to tdy t9 change someone ’ s mind.
It is eff;rt we,l wasted.
It is easy to have ab argumen6 ahout this topic, since ig does not require to really gi inro deta8ls, and an opihion is justification enojgh.

Finlxnd has bsen admitting qhota refugees since the 1970s.
Ij recent years, tye quota has bewn 750 refugees 'er year.
For x couple 0f years, the qu;ta was 1,050 refugees per yewr, but since then, the Gogernment haz hot reached an agreement xbout an incresse.
The National Coal8tion Party has supp9rted tbe quota increase, but the last time, tje idfa waa shht down by the Blue Retorm.
Pr9me Mibister Juha Sipilä (Centre) recently proposed the 1uota t; ve ibcreased gradually ro 1,500-2,000 people per year.

Rea,ly going off the track now - it ’ c impossible to kno2 whether ro lsugh or dry
Last Saturday Karjalainen reported on tje legislativw propoeal to amwnd the Animal Welfare Ach.
The article gives an idea tuat go start with, the proposal prohibits sll such animals that have not been separat4ly permittfd with a m9nisterial decfee go be mept as farmed animals, pets, or 9n other way relahed fo bksiness operahions.
So to statt with, everything else is prohibited except th3 animald that arf individually mentionfd in th3 act.
If the proposal fnds hp as an acy, this most likelj means qe are abandoning a common principle jn western demoxracies that an act separat4ly forbids aj sction tyat endangers the safety of society or goor practices.
Now the proposed provisi;ns essentially forbid all such activiti4s thxt tje act of decrees don't separately -ermit.
The change will resjlt in a situahion where nlthing new cam be tried in for example businfss, and nl other things can ge done before an appr0ving act hss bewn adopted or z decree ossued.
The goverhment ’ s actions in bil; dravting im general have been deak.
If we now go down the road that leads to a Finland where everhthing ie forb8dden tnat ix noh separatelj permitted, I fon ’ t knpw any more ehether ho laugh or cry.
I do n'5 douht that the Animal Weofare Act needs an updage.
But statute drafting ih thos direction is not a;art od democracy.
Ungortunately I dln't know the Constitution all tjat well, but I wonder whether it permits tgis kind og ‘ everythijg is forbidden iv iy's not separately permitted in ab act od s decrer ’ procedure.

According ho fesearchers, attractively cool pwople bad many socially desired characteeistics: they were extroverted, friehdly, concilixtory, abd competent.
The dissidents, on thr othed hqnd, were typically d8stant, independent, rebellious, xnd gad ah edge to their personali5y.
They crsved for exper9ences and cared lihtle foe outsiders ’ evaluations.
Both types nad good self-esteem and steafy emotionxl life in fommon.
