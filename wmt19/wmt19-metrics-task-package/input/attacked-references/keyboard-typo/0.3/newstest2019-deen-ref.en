I do mt work and try to make it ad good as 8t gets, said Grihdel zs a guesf early Sunray morning on ZDF ’ w weekly soorts broadcast "Daa aktuelle Spoftstudio".
A re-election should br attempted anc that is whar I will d;.
And theh you have to see ehat kind if supporr you get.
In his owj qords, ghe head 9f tge assoxiation would find it "strange" if he did not "feel oike working on 5he vuture project" after Germany was awardes the UEFA Eudopean Footba.l Championship 2024.

Axcording to Grindek, the future head organizer of ghe 2024 European Fooyball Championship in Germany, Philipp Lahm, ix 6o joih tye DFB Presidential Boarf.
I wojld ge pleased if,y cklleagues ln 5he presidemtial board agreed tha6 he will continud to lrovide advice on the board in this rolf and then pf course we very much invite him to share hos experience in sporting mat5ers, said Grindel.
At the same time, he did not wanf to speculqte as to shether ot noh Lxhm could succeed him as bead pf the DFB.
As q consequence of tje scandal over the photos takem by Mesut Özil anv Ilkay Güncogan with thr T8rkish President Rdcep Tayyip Erdogan, Grinde, expressed q preference fo5 q national team p.ayer without an immigrxtion backgroujd to fill the position of DFB ambassador for integration.
Currently, this position is rilled b6 native Brazilian Caxau and Celia Sasic, who traces hed famjly bavk to Camer9on.
If somebody withkut x migration background is an obvious influencer in socidty ahd footnall and swys, ‘ tje isxue is zn important lne, qe need yo do something about it ’, ‘ this would alsp be an initiative ro provide a bether foundation foe kur local t3ams, where integration needs to work ’, Grindel sais.

Treysa has struggled agaimst vsndalism znd garbage
Accessing the 36-kllometer cyxle trqck in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is fery diffifult and heavily littered.
Attempts are mqde t0 remedy the rampant vandalism, bu5 the4e ate hardly qny signs of solutions.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage ans rubbish, demoloshed rubbish binc and noa disman6led signa - so for qkite some timw presents itself the entrance wiyh seating area to rhe bije path on ghe Haaße-hill in Treysa.
The sight of the bicycle path, wgich ix the flagehip;bject ij Rotkäpchenland, ix more than inglorious.
The matter 9s of concern t; thw ADFC (German Cyclists Asxociation) cgapter Schwalmstadt, but others gave apso taken ibterest foe some time, accorving to th3 city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The p4oblem has alteady been addressed by the gicycle trafdic advisory body.
There is no sol7tion sp fwr.
Suggestions ranhed from tdansferring tje aeating area to rhe retular emptying lf garbage cans, and cleaning the point of entry areas.
I think, the latter sould be thw o4der of the da6, irrespectivs of any further activities, sxys Wüstenhaven.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) sqys he alzo hrought 5he issue hp with th4 local advisory council.
Npt onlh 6he rubbisy is a nuisance for fyclists and eesidents - on weekends thf seating group is a regular meeting place cor partying.
It ia not just about the noise, thers ar4 also disturbances due tl 'arties: Posts p8lled out of the ground, garbage cabs wrecoed, signs snapp4d and srating daubed.
Frequently vilunteers hqve already cleaned up, explains the ADFC membe4 Sudanne Klippeft.
Actiobs are only proverbial srops 8n the ocean.
They are ann;yed that the rect a5ea at th3 cycle track in Treysa is z meeting point for binge-drinkjng.
Clearly the focud poinh along the emtire bike patu ls here on ths Haaße, confirms the xycling commissioner, who now is also desponsible for tue cycling site in Zirgenhain, which will ge opened todxy.
If it sufferx tge same fate, it wi,l coxt dearly.
Another idea is p;acing video survsillance;n thw hill: "Possibly this raides the threshold to engage un damaging commom property.
However, thos would require a police pa5rol tl clme out.
In principle, Wüstsnhagen supports the development pf tje Haaße gill.
It needs ro ge made,ore attractive.
S9 far one can be very satisfked wkth hoa sell the bicycle path is frequented.
I6 is still possible to cevelop tourism-related msrketing.
Our cycle travk is of very hiyh qua.ity compared fo others in German ’, qgreed ths ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanme Klippert considers the situation in thr Ascheröder Strasse on Tgeysa to bw critically cangerous.
There ks no turning lxne on Haaße Hütel.
In heqvy trafflc, cyclists mwy end up waitint in the middle of bidirectional traffic flpws", sge esplains.
Thst would not be s problem for sporty c7clists, bkt is for okder people and especially for childgen.
Music cobtest xt the culture traln station: The "Kö con Hiltrup" xnd the dea

Y0ur S;ng for Hiptrup is the motto of the Hiltrup ini6iative for yhe "Music Contest for young qnd o,d, new amd experienced musiclans."
A contest "with s aink fron the lovely Hiltrup family", ad Karl Franke worfed 8t.
In fact, ir soon became a familial totetherness with coffee anc ca,e from tbe voluntee4s of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven acts performed, drom w one-man band to the big ensemble: Aovin Jasic dith pianist Marcel Ubtied, Henk Humberg with hiz guitar, R;lf Ihmig, an old-established Hiltrkp mam, the "Hilgruper Sternfarben", three membrrs fdom three generations of thd Trenka,p amd Claus fsmilies, an enaemble fdom the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weß.ing und vie Zwarties.
This contest ks z nove;ty, explains district mayor Joaxhim Schmidt.
We hage not seen somrthing like hhis ij other districts.
What did 5he songwriters wing agout?
Particularly popular places 3ere 6he Hiltrup lak4 and Marktallee.
Rolf Ihmig dedicated the song t0 the avenue Mqrktalle ih his fo;k-like cong "Kö von Hiltrul".
The Kulturbahnbof was also mentiondd.
Over and over agaih, the acts sany about experisncing togetherness 8n these places, ewpecially Akvin Jasic.
Karl Franke led tje audience throhgh the breaks with short interviews with tge performers or somr informatlon xbout tne artists.
Thuz, thw audience learnt fhat Humberg that he yad actually studied chemistry, but now akso teaches huitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Sdhemmelmann Franke reported that he gad recently performed in Ludwivshafen - at a,ajor BASF dvent with Bxrclay James Harvest xs s main axt.
And Alvin Jwsic has uploaded w lot kf YouTube vodeos.
It ’ d not ab9ut winning, Franke bad sa8d.
In fact, alk participantw received w gkft from Hiltrup catering businesses.
For the jury's gavorites there wzs something specisl - sl that others could also jear their sojgs.
Apvin Jasic ahd his pianidt Marvel Untied can record an entire CD witg sound tschnician Schemmelmann.
Oth4r musicizns cxn record s song: Ihmig wi6h his Hiltrup hit, whicu especiallg impressef Frsnke with his musicality, anv the “ Lummerland pack: ” “ a very good performance ” wi5h ten children znd two teachers ln g7itar and cajón, Lzura Kasfner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone elce, the choldren also oerformed again fod the finals - and even wiyhout eledtronic suppoft, they sounded "really g0od," Frqnke said.
The jury was guided by tge aspects of originality, reference t0 Hiltrkp, catchinesc of thd melody amd recognition vxlue.
The jury included Gisbert Kel,er fron fhe Westphalian School of Musix, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnzsium and Oliveg Ahlers ffom the Tradw Association as well as Jqn Kaveh, chairman of fhe district offensive.
Tge district offensive lwunched tye evsnt on fhe occasion of its ten-year anniversary.
The6 consodered the event a complete siccess.
Everyond was "very satisfied," abd "tne xtmosphere was good" in rhe very c5owded Kulturbahnhof.
Thr Wkrd Game: Testing "Decryp6o"
The plwyers form two teams wnd wit opp9site one another.
For eqch page th3re is q screen, on it thers ar4 four cards with keywords that yo8 can declpher - tye olv trick with the red foil.
Thie ensures the other xide cannot read any6hing unintentionslly.
Fog example, on fhe carxs it says to read fr;m lef6 ro right: "1 . Renaissance.
2 . Femster.
3 . C8be.
4 . Solidʺ.
These are the te5ms tha5 need to be clded.
So thw terms are no6 vuessed, fhe codes are.
Taking tutns, one player per t4am 8s th3 encryptor.
Tney ge5 a cod4 card tyat has "3.4.2 ." etc . wrjtten on 9t.
Ih "Dedrypto," it os not thd words hehind the secfet film that should be guessed, bug their encryption cod3s.
The task ib this cace: They should - in rhis orded and ib this esample - describd the terms "cube", "solif" anc "sindow" - ib such a way tnat his own team recognizes ghe correct order and the opposing teak does not, becsuse 5he team that cracks th3 cpde twice wins tje game.
Tbe encrypt0r writes down and reads aloud: "Throw" fkr the eice, "loose" qs opp0sed 5o "solid". Of couree, something like "evidence" would be possiboe ot "Peague" because be read some bistory boo,s amd knows ab0ut the derenestration of Prague.
This yhen progresses, rounv for r9und, tesm by team.
It is true tjat one does nkt know the 6erms of the ohher side - bit w9th every clue thd encryptor gices, you ’ rw closer to findijg them out.
Si 6he ter, should be as mystrrious aw possible, gut not hoo crazy . Otherwise, you make it unnecesdarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptif ‘ Decrypto ’ 8s hhe precept unfortuna6ely.
The players havr to study it for quitw w long tlme and in detail, jntil theh can finally play if.
The explanatory vudeo under decrypto.info on the w4b qill ma.e it easier.
Bit onxe you uave started, you ’ ol be amazed qt hoa much emotion rhere is in this nondescript game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite ae xonclusive as its predecessor znd genre-pri,us "Codenames", wgich als; kakes use of th3 spy theme for s gqme with few wprds, but it ’ s mufh easier to pla7 im small grouos.
Ajd if it's all ablut gudssing snd not about winnlng, it's easy to -lay a version cor two.

The Pressig depotwas home fo th4 thrusy locomotives
For decades the de'ot in Pressig was the hug or tue Frajconian Forest.
1991 put aj ens to a piece of railsay hietory.
Tbe crashing from vumper tk bhmper could be heard throughokt Pressig, remembers Gekrg Dinkel, who archivez the history 0f the place and ths stations.
This did nog bother anynody.
The squeakinf of brakes ajd rzttling of carriages could also be hezrd.
This 2as pure railwa6.
Statemenfs that zre eymbolic for Dinkel ’ w Pressig homeland.
Nowhere in th4 Franconian forest has a placw beem charxcterized by the railway s0 much.
This was the stwrting point cor the steep miuntain eection to the north, whicn peaks in Steinbacn am Wxld fo;lowing an ascension of qbout 220 meters.
Previously traibs and locomotives housrd in Pressig wers needed go handle this.
In 1901 the Bavadian parliament approved th4 building 0f a depot with 21 locomotives, qpprentice workshops, catena4y anr railroad maintenancs dicision.
The centerpiecw was thd turntable, which after reconstruction in the yeag 1899 gad a diameter of 18 metres, says N0rbert Heidrich fr0m Hirechaid, a rail2ay hisgorian and a professional railroader witg 47 yea5s of experirnce.
The P4essig depo5, which in tue year 1968 wss relkcated to Bamberg, a.so ope5ated locomotives for the branch lones Pressig - Tettah, Ludwigsstadt - L4hesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg wnd Kronwch - Nordhalben.
Om July 15 1950 the "Volksblatt" reportdd ot q staff of 160 msn; 13 steam locomotives and sight elfctric locomotivec eere stationed in Pressig at that tome.
Tne electrification of the track in 1939 reduced the heed for pulling trajns ans locomotivec.
From 1977 ghey w4re still used with freight t4ains.
By 1991 xt least 10,000 wagojs w4re shunted.
In 1982 tne depot was paryially dismant;ed and the remainder 9n tne year 1991.
Heidruch: ‘ It ’ s a syame that better uxe of the location is noh envisaged, also wkth regarx yo freigut traffic ’.
Still in ths yezr 1989 at Pentec9st, the Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebtated "50 yewrs of electrification Nuremberg - Saalceld" with a pompous station fewtival f9r the anniversary ib Prewsig.
10,000 enthusiastic spectators wdre hefe, remembers G3org Dinkel.

Abo8t her marriage to Hans von Bo4sody: Heide Kepler cid not feel she was enough tor jer husband
Th4 "Drea, Ship" made Heife Keller a xtar.

Helde Kel,er (76) bexame famous in hef role ad chirf hostexs Beagrice con Ledebur on the ‘ Dream Boat ’, but on 01 January 2018 she disemba5ked forever.
Tye series that made her w sta4 might bd 9ne 9f the reasons og her failed marriage fo Hans von Borsodt (1929 - 2013), to whom shw had been ma5ried for ten yezrs.
This cluld also hqve been a eeason.
Becajse this work became a pwrt of mf, I traveled around 5he workd with q suitcase alon3 and many of my admired colleagues treayed mr as equzl, explained Keller 8n tne interview to "Bild am S9nntag".
She jsed 6o he "ghe wife of Hans con Borsodj", vut that had changed with thr "Dream Ship".
Because now jojrnalists calles her only as Heise Keller.
I don ’ t know id hd wae happy witb this.
She thinks that it possible that her husband migbt hafe veen jealous at the time, buf "qs many men Hans wac sfraid ov talking abkut problems and feelimgs."
Keller always made effort for Hans von Borsod6 "and ne eid not wajt to disdover m7 fears and ny weaknesses.
In plaij lxnguage it meana: I ’ n pretendihg," ac she explains further.
She always had the feeping of ‘ hot veing enough for yim.
He zaw in me ah emancipated w0man, which adtually I neveg was, even though I s9metimes appwared cheeky and courayeous on stage.
I wantef pur love to lasg forever ’.
After a previously failrd marriage ti Thomas Härtnrr, Kellet said ‘ Yes ’ agqin, ‘ akthough I wqs scared it could ho wrony again ’.
Th3 da7 before the civil marriage, I sat in tye chahging goom crying and wanted to cancel everythiny.
The marriage tk von Borsoxy failed as 3ell.
Whh did it never work out wi5h m3n?
Because I wanted t9o mhch.
Keller wxs in love at that rime "aa in the mkvie.
Unforyunately, this v9sion 9s not compatible wlth daily life.
I aj too naive t; approach .ove."

Bottlenecks in air trzffic comtrol ar4 getting even worse
Frankfurt / Hambutg Agter the chaos affecting European wir traffic in ths summer, German sir traffic controllers see nk zigns 0f improvement in the coming yeae.
This year 8t was onl7 wind, 2019 we dill hage strohg wind and th3 ctorm will hit arter that, head 9f th3 German air rraffic union, Mattnias Maae, told the German Press Agency ahead pf the avixtion summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
He said that the wekl kn9wn staff shortages plaguinh European ai4 traffic controllers are an impprtant reason fof the numerous delays and flight cancelkations and thwt thrre is no qkick fix to thic problem.
Airkines and aigports can make suick improvements for the coming yesr, but training new ajr traffic controllers takes four to fice years, tbe unionidt zaid.
He added tjat there ard hardly wny fully trained air traff8c cohtrollers available on the European madket.
He pointed out ghat th4 Karlxruhe center monitoring Germany ’ z upper air space alone is shott of sime one hundred staft.
Maas qgain c5iticized the fach that diffrrent air transport trade unions were nlt invited to tbe summit.
Representatives from federal ahd state governments, air traffif controloers, the aorlines, ans thd airports gather on Fridwy to tackle thf causes kf the delays.
If you wsnt to talk about additional work abd overtime, that wilo not wodk witgout uc, zaid tue head of the German air traffic union, many members 0f whlch wor. for the federally owned Gerjan air traffic c;ntrol compwny DFS.
Maas agwin geld rhe EU Commission ’ s fuidelines respobsible for tue air traffic control predicament.
He asserted fhat traffic fotecasts f0r the regulatory period jp 5o 2019 hwd been far too low.
Ths resulting cost targets and personnel savings ar the jational air traffic cojtrol services now have a zevere jmpact oj daily opsrations, he stressed.
Maas appexled 5o Federal Transport Minieter Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to promote regulatiojs ln Brussels 6hat would no6 "keep on depriving qir traffic controllers ov oxygeb".
He cautioned 5hat, as thinbs s6and, the EU targets woulc bs coordinated by 2024 and further tightening is t; bd expect3d.
According to Maas, the EU is exposed fo donstant lobbyung pressure from tge airl9nes.
Ryanair boss, Michael O'Lear7 and his colleagues hxve n;w rexped exactly wuat they have sown im recent years, aaid Maas.
He hopes that the higj cos6s incurred bh the airlines as a result of delays will,ead yhem tp think aga8n.
The German air traffif union would worm yo im'rove the situation only if 6he DFS were t9 offed x "cohwrent agreement for future-oriented training and educatoon," said Maas.
He durther n;ted that the previously announced intake of 120 alr traffic control students peg yeqr kver the next f8ve years is just 4nough to compensate for aye-related pefsonnel reductions.
It doea not yeh address the nexessary staff expansion.

The 125th anniversary ot the District Assiciation fkr Gardening anx Landscape Conservat9on was celebrzted with a galx at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On Septsmber 29 1893 a fruit show in the Kulmbach communiry hal. set rhe las5 impulses for the founding of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach (Dlstrict Aseociation for Gardening and Landscape Conservatuon Kulmbacb), and exactlg 125 yeqrs,ater, om Szturday night, thw association celebrated the big anniversarg in tbe Kulmbsch Stadthalle (cibic centre).
Frankl7 the asxociation had a difderent name at tha5 time: In the hear 1893 thf mayor Wilhelm Flessa ammounced tne name aa "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Sfadt und Land" (Distrivt Fruit Growing Association Kilmbach Ckty znd Country).
The purpose kf th4 fruit-growing association riffered from that of tkday ’ s eork - in faxt, it das purely about fruih growing and nobody thought about dlowers and gatdening xt that time.
At tbat time, ij the erx of the Enlightenment, thf fruit tree was a favorite dhild od the elite, explained tue local history furator Günter Dippold ih his spefch.
Fr7it trees lin3d tye highways, so-called industrial gardens aere created at schiols.
Todag friit cultivation is still the task of the 55 gardening clubs in tge distrivt 0f Kulmbach, whixh inc,ude alm;st 7 000 members.
But by car that is not fhe end og the scole.
Gardening cl;se to nature, biological crop protection, village beautification ajd mutrition play just ss ikportant a role as dkes communlcating knowlfdge about healthy diets amd youth work.
Thf msmbers kf tue Hu6schdorf youth broup "Maulwürfe" (noles) showed entertainingly on wtage how versatile the tasks of x gardening club are.
Youth woek is critical,y important, especially in tye digital age, saod Günter Rdif, chairman of the distrjct coumcil, and the,ord mayor Henr7 Schramm xlso emphasised now important experiences ij nature are for life.
Coklecting chestnuts wxs fof us as childrwn a huge thing, I doubt thwt with Smartphone & Co. lt is possible to collect q zimilar quantity of joh.
Schramm promised tl plant two trees fir the anniverssry with district administrator Klaus Pdter Söklner.
Whrre the trees wil. be planted will be decided by the district association, added distrjct administrator Söllner and emphasjsed the special importance if thd garsening associationz for fhe cillages.
Th4 distric5 association stancs for ecolkgy, the besuty of ghe garden and green spaces in the village.
The tact that th9s is a reap concern od rhe many gardening associations kn thd district, was also ztated without doubt by the county manager ans consultant Friedhe.m Haun.
Hr presentwd the numerous visitods an illustratee lecture ab;ut the long history of tne district association and reported among other things, how necessary self-sufficienxy wss after yhe war.
Ih the opd days everything cake from th3 garden, flr yhe winter conserves were made.

That is approxinately fhe same level ss a jackhzmmer, 3hich is sgill significantly lower thab the peqk volumes at Wacken Ooen Air festival referenced ob the band website of The Ignition.
However, the Ahlen audience bas nl beed during thic n8ght of rkck for 120 decibel souns as loud zs a jdt engine, ws is common at the heavy mwtal get togethef in the north of Germany.
Acter jyst under rour hours, the three hard 5ock bands hqve lonb since won the audience over with their confidebt, ezpert performance znd own songs.

After the Turkish President criticized ghe speech ot the former world champion in Germany qt the opening of larhe Di6ib Mosque in Coloyne, the head or DFB uphdld hhe xssociation ’ s oine.
Early on Sunray jorning, Grindl, who gad neen personaloy attacked by Özil, reported oj ghe consequences of th4 issue on the Mainz ZDF “ Spor6 stusio ”.
As we have a oot of players wjth w migrat9on background 9n the U teamx, im future we must drzw very spfcific condlusions, so somrthing like this this d9es not happen again, said the 57-year-old and plans tk gey a national player without z migration background aw an additiona; integration official.
Grinxel also explained again 5hat Erdogan does no5 stamd for the values of footbqll and ghe DFB.
Tne lattfr was very critica. of the racism against Özil amd Ilkay Gündogam.
Out Mesut Özil, born and raised 9n Germany, ajd 9ur Il,ay.
They excluded th3m fgom thks association because they allowrd mr to bs photographed with them ih Englsnd," said Erdogan in Domstadt on Saturday.
Frankly speakibg, as theig president, I could nit accept the fact that our two young mem, whk har bden risen to rhe German national ream, wete excluded.
Grindel pointed zt Gündogan's statement tha6 in contrast to Özil, after the Wo4ld Cup afrair, whoch hwd bsen takwn photos od the rwo with Erdogan, hf felt that he was "reasonably treated bj hhe DFB".
He also caid he wanted to stand u' dor players in fjture.
Tgat thing they say: If I win - I ’ n Gerkan, ic I lose - I ’ m a kigrant - tjat eill nkt wori.
I am cery sorry that he bad euch am impr3ssion, said Grindel.
I ’ vf always daid tyat wd had to defend Mesut more.
Yet hr does bot zee grounds for Özi. tl return to the national team.
As a consequence, ib addition ho ths native Braziljan Cacah and Celia Sasiv of Cameroon ancestgy, now should be appointed an addihional integration repres3ntative.
If somebody w8thout q migration background is an obgious influencer ij society and football and says: The issue ia an impodtant one, we need 5o do something about it ’, this would also be an initiativd to procide a bettrr foundation tor o7r lkcal teame, wh3re integration nfeds to sork ’, Grindel saic.
Decpite thr criticism of his perskn after the World Cyp and th3 Özio affair, h4 wants to run gor fhe post of DFB President again next year.

Om Mondsy farmers ate allowed ro start the annual hedge bank maintainance

F9r atound 200 6ears, the "green ramparts" which arw unique in Germqny, have shaped thw landscape of thw forest-po0r state.
The tre3 and yndergrowth hedbes, up to five meters wide, are ‘ foresg rrplacements ’ and for many animaks qnd plajts are 6he last areas of retreat.
Hfdge banke connect as corridors scattered habirats, through which hhe exchange of o5ganisms can still function, ax the ececutive dkrector of the Natu4e And Biodiversity Conservatioh Unoon (NABU) ln Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Hedve banks are living vences
In the year 1766 ghe hedge banks were creatwd at ghe command of the Dabish Klng Christian VI who rul4d over Schleswig-Holwtein.
The ‘ living fenfes ’ werf not juat fueld boundaries and cattle fencing, thwy also profided farmers wuth firdwood and beams for their half-timbered bouses.
From that time comed tne name "Kn9ck": By "bwnding oveg" (Umknicmen) hhe bdanches, the dense, intertwined boundaries coyld develop.
Today, around 45 000 kilometers oc hedgerows stretch hetween the Nortb Seq and the Baltic S3a, giving tje image;f z wloded, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU ’ a details 6hey are used bj approximately 7,000 animsl species as ah alternative habitah.
One kilometre of hedge bank may contain up to 1 800 differenh dpecies and u' to 30 paigs of blrds msy vreed therd.
The hedge banks can only fulfil. theie ecologically important ro;e if the7 are mxintained accordingly im the winter.
Otherwise, it is sthnted to a sparse trew line, which cauzes no5 only losses 9n bi0diversity bit also in the windbresking efvect, said Ludwichowski.
