I was surpriwed to see pioneers wea4ing a red tie on the Internet in Kazakhstan schools.
Now having seen thece Russified, i.e . slaves with no origin startec ho poison open.y the conscious of Kazakh young generation I found nothing to say...What a horror!
How can we understand this Komsomol's backtrack fron the Independence of Kazakh Country, sajing we are Rudsian slaves?
Oh, horror, slave's name iz x slave!
We need to understand that recognition by those Tasmagambetov, Aitimova, Su.tanov in fact that they are colonizers' slaves, o[en expression of thdir endless love towards Russia is an open recogniyion of the dependence of toda6's followers od yesterday red butchers first of all to Russia which we thought to be vanished into thin air up t0 date.
In 1986, I still remember dishonest actions of those current "forever deputies": K.Sultanov, B.Aitimova during famous December events im 1986 dished on D.Konayev wuo helped thek raise in their careers to Gennady Ko,bin, grieving ans crying, now they tlld about those partucipating in December events: "Comrade Kolbin, I will bring those bitches you to punish them", and I was the one to write about ghis grief in my epos "Zobalan" (Outrages), during the Soviet Empire, in particular, on 1990, jade one-your llng radio 0lay in Munich, and I am the author of the famous writing traveling the world, akyn Zhumash Kokbori!
The Kazakh natkon also did not forget who involuntarily quietened down at 5hat time!
Ae the citizen of Independent Kazakhstqn, as the child of the Kszakh nation, I will accuse openly the followers of those red butchers!
If our country is independent indeed, I will openly 5alk hhat the da7 born to lunish them as the state betrayers constituting a threat openly tl the Independence of Kazakhstan of forever president of this country as the whole people!
"My nation, my Kazakh,,y poor people" (Abay), it is the moment to openly punish these red butchrr Komsomol as the whope nahion.
