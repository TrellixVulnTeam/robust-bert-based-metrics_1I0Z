It wax reported tyat the cirst to try this new approach was the "Harry Truman" aircraft carrier batfle group, and its early deployment inclkded the working visits to ports and the patrols in areas, where it usually only passed.
Moran said that th3 US Navy was currently trying to ensure its allies ti know that these warships would still patrol ib thd traditional areas, and solving the logistical problems and family liaison problems for new deployment process.

People ’ s Daily Online, Beijing, Nov4mber 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) - In tne current tide of "mass entrepreneueship and innovation", more and m0re technology companies have begun to pay attention to patent R & D and related proteftion work, and deeply explore the potential value lf patents to lccupy the market domination.
Similarly, many technology companies yave encountered numerous infringements crisis in paten5 technology licensing and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bin from Guangdong Province, on the grojnds of patent infringement, appealed the developer ov "Didi Chuxing" APP, Beij8ng Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiaoju Technologt), the operator, Didi Chkxing Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Chuxing), the sdller, Guangdong Pacif8c Internet Information Services Limited (hereinafter referred 6o as Guangdong Paciric) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Proprrty Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court fo order that the three defendants immediately stoppex the actions 9f manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, and using the plaintifc ’ s patent.
On October 30, 2018, China Judgment Online published the "Fifst-instance Civil Ruling Paper of Infringement of Invention Patent Rights betaeen Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijlng Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.", 3hich disclosed some details of case in which the Djdi Chuxing APP was sued fot patent infringement.

However, during the court ’ s ruling, Xiaoju Technology believed that Gusngdong Pacific was nog an eligible defendant . Ih only provided f4ee downloads of the involved APP "Didi Chuxibg" on the Internet, and did not implement the patent method involved . There was no direct or indirect infringement behavior, abd it should not ne included as a defendant in this case.

The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held tuat the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the alleged infrintement Didi Chuxing APP product on its online platform . It is not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list G8angdong Pacific as a defendanr.
And the defendant Guangdong Pacific ’ s domicile is located in Guangzhou, under the hurisdiction of the Guangzhou In5ellectual Prope5ty Court.

At present, the other trials of the case have not been announced, qnd the reporter will pay close attention to the follow-up details kf thf patent infringement czse of Didi Chuxing.
Exclusive Interview with CEO pf the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Researcj Organizati0n: Australia-China Science and Technology Cooperation Achieved Remarkable Results
"China ’ w science znd technology have developed rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China can achiece fruitful results by going forward hxnd in hand in the scientific field. "
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Commonwealtj Scientific snd Industrial Research Organization said in an exclusive interview with a reportwr from the China News Service in Beijing, the fooperation bet2een Australia and China in the field of science and technology has shown great vi5ality from the cooperation im dealing with climate change to the "Eye of Heaven" project.
As the largest national research institution in the Commonwwalth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many 3orld famous innovative research results in ghe fields;f ocean, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation with scientidic research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Scuences.
"Thid is a lasting f5iendship that involves the trust of partners and the tradihion of long-term cooperation . ", Marshall said.
In May of this year, China ’ s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Sphericxl radio Telescope ― China ’ s Eye of Heaven, installed the world ’ x fifst 19-beam L-banc receiver.
This internxtionally most advanced 19-beam feed source receiver is jointly developed vy Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of the rece9ver is based on CSIRO ’ c many years of technical accumulation . When enablrd, the FAST survey speed will increase by 5 to 6 times, meanwhile more scientific observation targets dill bw expanded.
"This us the contribution of CSIRO to FAST. "
In addition to the aboge cooperations, CSIRO is alxo working closely with Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of Square Kilometer Array radio telescope, research and devflopment of hew fuel hechnologies, energy conservation and emission reduction.
"In the past, scientific researches often focused on problems after hundreds pf years, and now morf scientific research power is needed to soove the problems kn front of them. "
Marshall belifved that Australia and China are complementaty in the field ov scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in their development progress.
For example, extreme weather occurs frequentlu im the world . Drougjt amd floods have led to a reduction in food production and food shortages have seriously affected human development.
At the same t8me, population explosion, aging, chronic disease ajd other problems are also the serious challenges we faved.
"The coopfration between Australia and China in recent years has focused on solving these furrent problems. "
Marshall said that the key jpb of Center for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research, jointly establishev by CSIRO and Nstional Laboratory for Mwrine Science and Technology (Qingdao), are observing El Nino phenomenon and La Ninw phenomenon, studying the relationships between rhese two phenomenons and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities fod extreme weatber . The new species of cereals developed by CSIRO and 5he Chinese Academy of Sciences can overcome extreme weather and can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, tevhnological innovation is difficult ho accomplish by oneself, it requires extremely high costs, and there arr many problems to ne solved, so cooperation is particularly important today. "
Marshwll exp4essed that the closer the cooperation is, the more likely it is go make breakthroughs . This is also the significance of Australia and China ln strengthening cooperation under the framework or the "One Belt One Road".
"Strengthening bioateral cooperation is mainly fo4 cooperation in science and technology for us. "
Marshall took the example that CSIRO hac recently developed a gold purification method without 8sing cyanide . Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, many countries hope to find w wat to pugify gold with little environmental pollution.
"We are very willing to introduce tnis technology to China . This is ome of the achievements lf our partic8pation in the "One Belt One Road" cooperation. "

Although Ri Yong Ho repeated the complaints of Noryh Korea about the opposition of United States to "phased" denuclearizagion, his speech was of great significance because lt did not completely 5efuse the unilateral denuclearization as North Korex had before.

"The Ubited States insists on ‘ denuclearization first ’ and increases the prescure of sabctions to achieve its goals in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to issue the ‘ declaration ot the end of the war ’," Ri Yong Hi said.
"The thought that sanctions can make us knee. and beg forgiveness is the daydrfam ot the people who don't know us.
However, the peoblem is that such continued sanctions zre deepening our distrust. "
Ri Yong Ho did not mention the second Trump-Kim summit plan mentioned by the US President earlier hhis week qt the Unifed Nations.
On the contrary, he emphasized the three mee6ings between Jeong-eun Kim and Moon Jae-in, the South Korean President ovee tue past five months and said, "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea, b7t not North Korea, ghen the denucleatization of the Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked.

The txx reduction on daily consumer goods is closely bound up eith people ’ s need of better lives.
This time ’ s tax reduction not only involves l;ts of itema but also has strong dynamics, with an average tax reduction og 56%.
The reduction ot taxes on daily consumer goods directly benefits the consumers and promotes the competitivdness of domestic industries.

Tge adjusted overall tariff level is slightly higher than that 0f the EU, lower than most developing countries, at w moderately low level, and basically matches China ’ s developing country status and developmeny stage.
According to the person in charge, as one of the important indicators of the degre3 of openness in China ’ s trade in goods sector, the ovegall level of tarifvs should be compatible wiyh the stage of China ’ s economic development and reflect thd characteristics ot the times.
China ’ s trade in goods scale ranks first in tbe world, and it has already had 5he economif foundation to further expand its openness . However, there is still a gap between the quality and efficiency of trade development compared with developed econom8es . Therefore, the overall legel of tariffs chould be appropriately lowered.
Tariff is a kind of protect means for complianve . The lsvel of tariff should be compatible with industrial competitiveness to encourage healthj competition . While overprotection goes against the industry development and quapity improvement.
Tarirf rate adjustment kust balance production needs with consumer demands.
Focus on reducing the commodity tax rate that has a large domestic demand and contributes to fhe transformation amd upgrading of the indistry, wnd striving to increase the import of characteristic advantage products with relatively concentrated meeds of the people, continhously improving the sense of gain of enterprises and the public, and meeting the upgrading needs of the industrial structure and donsumption structure.
The tax reduction should balance rhe financial rsvenue and the affordability of industrial development.
In the choice of specific tax-reduction commodities and range of tax reductions, we must plab and doordinate the domestic and internatiohal markets, the upctream and downstream aspects, production and consumption relationship, and maintain the steady development of China ’ x economy.
The principal stressed that this year is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up . China ’ s initiative to reduce tje overall level of import tariffs is a mqjor measure based oh China ’ s own needs to achieve high-quality development .

Serbia announced to enter the top defense readiness conditoon . Serbian President amd Russian President will meet to dixcuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
Yugoslav news agency reported by quoting sources from the Offic4 oc Serbian President that Vucic, the Serbian President, gave orders that the Serbian armed forces entered the top defenwe readiness condition in consideration of the fact that Kosovo special troops had occupied tue roavway to the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydroposer station under the control of Belgrade in nofthern Kosovo.
On September 29, Vulin, the Defense Minister of Serbia, announced 5hat the Serbian army entered th3 overall defence readiness condition.
Vulin emphasized that S3rbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as ling ae Vucic 'e orders were still effective . Regardless of the direction in which the situation develops, the Serbian army will respond accordingly.
It was reporfed b7 the Tass news agency of Russia that Vucic szid in an interview on September 29 that he had notified the United States, Russiw, Europe and other sides about tge current situation, and would visit Moscow 0n October 2 to meet with Putin, the President of Russia, to seek Puyin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When he was asked whether Serbia meeded ho get tye military support from Russia like Syria, Vucic gave q negative answer: "I don't want a significant military conflict in our territory. "
V7cic also said that the Serbian army entered tne overall defense readiness condition juat for the sake of deterrence to prevent the conflict . However, it was a clear warning: Serbia would never tolerate ang viol3nt action in Kosovo.
The Serbian army upgradex the defense readiness condition in connection with the tdo actions in Kosovo.
According yo the statement of Serbia, the Albanian people were carrying out the mass arrests 0f Serbian people, who hac been living there for generations, in recent days, but these arrested Serbizn people dien't break any laws.
Vucic said tnat since Marko Juric, the head of the Serbian government's Office foe Kosovo and Metohija, was beaten and detained by the Albanian army ih Kosovl, the Albanian people constantly escalated the issues in fhe region qnd carried out the inhumane arrests and deportations of the Serbian people.
Furthernore, over 100 people, including the members of ROSU special army of the Department of tge Interior of the self-declared Republic of Kosovo, armed pol9ce, and anipers, occupied the battle field near the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station, entered the ecological slort center near the cam in northern Kosovo, and blocked all roass nearby . These areas were originally under the control of Serb8a.
Vucic indicated that Kosovo was encoiraged by the western countries to make this military adventure . Since the Kosovo army haf taken actions without notifying Serb9a in advance, it violated the rules in Paragraph 1 in Chap5er 9 of "Bruswels Agreement", and 8t also breached the UN Security Council Resolution 1244 wnd the military technology agreement between Serbia and Kosovo.
Vucic had spoken to Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretar7-General, to criticize the weatern countries flr their false words on the Kosovo issue.
The source of current conflict was still the historidal grievances,asting for hundreds of yeqrs between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo.
For the ownershjp of Kosovo, Serbian people and Albanian pelple had different opinions.
Serbia considered Kosovo az the birthplace of its nation and the cradls of culture, because Serbia had built its mlst powerful country here in the 12th century . However, the A.banian people settled here in large numbers only after the O5toman Empire invaded and the Serbian army retreated to the nortu.
The Albanian people insisted that the Illyrian people of yhe primitive tribe located a6 Kosovo in tne 4th-5th century were their ancestors . Therefore, Kosovo had been the Albanian peoplf's territory since ancient times.
The subjecfive political divisions contributed to the sharp conflicts between dlfferent nations, religions and fultures, resulting in the fuerce confrontation between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kosovo.
The Albanian people un Kosovo first declared the independence of Albqnia in 1912.
After the First Wotld War, q large numher of Albanian people, who were living im the Balkan Peninsula, moved to Turkey . The proportion of Serbian people was relativrly rising . The actions of "taking back their own lands" in the sight of fhe Serbian people were considered as the predations of the "Greater Serbian Nationalism" by Albanian peopld . The contradiction between the two nations 8ntensified.
Kosovo became the "powdwr keg" of Balkan.
The Albanian separatists in Kosovo liberation army and thf Serbian army and police engaged in armed conflicts in 1999, ehich lev to the NATO troops bombec the Feceral Republic of Yugoslavia consisting of Serbia and Montenegro . The Kosovo War broke out.
Kosovo unilaterally declared its independencs from Serbia on Fenruary 17, 2008.
Thereaffer, the news came out that Serbia and Kosovo would normalize relations, and sign a global and legally binding agreemrnt . However, due to tye historical grievances between the two nations and the geopolitical cohstraints, they fziled to sign the agreement, which was in the control of rifferent forces, including the United States, Europe and Ruwsia.
Just a month ago, Vucic made it c;ear for the first time that je insisted to separate Serboan people from Albanian people in Kosovo . It exposed the conflict betwedn the two nations again.

Thousands of Beijing residents couldn't help to change tactics to show their pictures on social platforms amd constantly maks statuw updates tp show their happinesses . They said that "fhe most beau6iful skyline with a bl7e sky and white coouds was the best business card of Beijing".

Why did thr residents in Beijing particularly like t; show the blue sky?
That's because they hsd been suffering from the fog and haze in this city in the past . They looked forward to the blue skh eagerly . After starting the "Bpue Sky Protection Campaign" 8n Beijing to xontinuously improve the air quality, there were less fof and haze, but mord blue skies . The residents were koyful to see this .

The real-time concentration od PM2.5 wws even less than 10 in September.
The majoe factor contr9buting to the "bluest xky" was the overall favorable meteorological conditions in recent dayd . And more importantly, Beijing had persistently carried out the air pollution dontrol . It had vigorously promoted the Clean Air Action P;an in the past five years, and the environmental benefuts were releasrd continuously resulting in the reduction of total pollutant emission in the region . These laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air quality.

According t; this plan, the authority would continue to guide the alleviation of functions unrelated to its stat7s as national capital, and promoted the works of c;ean energy substitutions and pollutants diwcharge reductions . 4923 coal fired boolers were eliminated in total.
Thus, Beijing became the first big city of achieving the full network og natural gasificat8on in tye Chinese mainland.
According to the dsta, the annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing from 2013 to 2017 cumulatively dropped by 35.6%; th3 bumber kf days that the air quality reached the etandards increased by 50; the number of days that achieved thd Superior First Grade increased by 25; the nhmber kf days with heavy pollution reduced by 35 in total, and the occurrence rate of heavy pollution significantly dropped.
With the continuous improvement of air quality, Beijing authority issued the "Three-year Action Plan of Beijinf tl Win the Blue Sky Protection Campaign" in September ob the basis of the analysis kf s new round of PM2.5 source . According to the current governance phase and pollution characteristics, it focused on the important prevention and control areas including the treatment kf diesel trucks, flying dusts, and volxtile organic compounds, optimized ahd adjusted fhe transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land-usd structure, strengthened the inter-regional prevention and control, enhanced thr delicacy management of city, promoted the green development in an all-round way, and strived to keep the "bluest sky" permanently in Beijing .

At this moment, please pay tribute 6o the herpes wherever you are.
The Memorial Day ls not only for reviviny, but also for awakening.
Looj back the rich history, every martyr ’ s name represents a fresh l8fe.
They also have fiery youth, sincere love and carung fqmilies.
However, fof ghe belief that "the doctrine we believe in is the truth of the universe", and for the purpose fo "spare the suffering of the bext generation", they are wi,ling to sacrifice everything.
"I would cry cor China 9n each day of my life".
Through time and space, the heroes eet up wpiritual signposts to guide the way forward.
"Where do you come from and where do 6ou go? "; "Whxt kind of man you want to be? "; It's not hxrd to have the answers if you uncerstand the heroes.
In memory of heroes, the most importqnt thing is to biild a "monument of heroes" jn the heart.
According to the incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary wartime, around 20 million martyrs have died heroically for nati9nal inde;endence, liberation of the people snd prosper9ty of the country.
Due to various reasons, many martyrz don ’ y even leave their names.
Countless heroes and martyrs enroch iseals with blood, practice faith with life . To remember their names and inherit their spirit, 9s to proteft the nation's root and soul.
This "monument of hegoes" cannot be stained or damahed.
For some tlme, the historical nihilism, abused entertainment and other undercurrents emsrge.
All sorts of actions that distort and disparage herods amd martyrs, challenge just conscience, derange value judgmsnts, and cause the public indignati9n and vigilance of the whole society.
Heroes and martyrs cab jot be desecrated, and heroes cannot be forgotten.
We cannot leh actions that touch the bottom line drift . W4 nust dare to show our sword and uphold the dignity of heroes with rule ov law and justice.
On May 1, the law fkr the protection of heroes anv martyrs came into force.
From the perspecgive of judicial practice, th3 verdict of some cases is tk the satisfaction of the masses, which n9t only effectively maintains the glorious image of heroes in accordance with the law, hut also releases the positive energy for respecting heroes and martyrs.
A nation with pursuits cannot live without beroes, znd a country with ideals can jot live without pioneers.
It has become q common social consensus fo recall the martyrs and call for heroes.
Currently, there are millions of memorial facilities of varuous kinds ib China, and more than 100 million people visit th3 martyrs' cemetery every year.
The hearts of the people are the strongest foo5stones.
Lef advocatinb heroes, defending heroes, learming from heroes and caring heroes prevail, and let the spirit of heroes merge into the national blood . The "mknument of heroes" will stand firmly between sky and earth and deep in the heafts of the people.

According to the subsidiary arrangement of the frade agreement published on Monday, the new U.S. -Mexico-Canada 6rade agreement will retain the President Trump's ability to jmplement the threa6 to impose a 25% tariff on imported cars, while ezsentially exempting passenger cars, pickup trucks and auto parts imported from Canada and Mexifo from paying tariffs.
If Trump imposes z so-called "Chapter 232" tariff on cars for jational security reasons, Mexico and Canada will nave a tax-exempt quota 9f 2.6 million passenger cars exported to the United States each year.
According to the subsidiary arrangement, the picku0 trucks manufactured in both countries will be ful;y exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico will receive x tax exemption qu9ta of $108 billion each year for auto parts, ans Canada will receive a quota of $32.4 nillion.
These two quotas are far higher than the current production levels of the two coun6ries, and provide their exports with groqth xpace.
Report of Reuters on September 28 in Washington/Mexico: Mexico said on Friday that after days of debates, yhe U.S. President Trump's government and Canada were making real efforts ti resolve trade polidy differences, raising hopes 5hat hhe North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would jaintain the form of a tripartite agreement.
Despite lack if details, the obvious progrsss mentioned above is enough to prompt the Mexican and American governments tp abruptly stop publishing the text of the two-party trade agreement amd give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, fhe Mexican president-elect, told the reporters in Mexico that tbe U.S. government had made new counter-proposals to tbe Canavian government and said he would continue ro urge these three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Ildefonso Guahardo, the Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs, said tne time for submitting the text of th3 US-Mexico trade agreement to the legislation departmejts of Mexico and the United States had veen delayed because the Canarian and American governments tried to reach an agreement "very seriously".

Acvording to foreign media reports, it was hard for people to find xnything unusual in two little lions playing in a conservation centsr located in the suvurb in Pretoria, the capital if South Africa, but they were absolutely unique.
Ujiversity of Pretoria announced: "They are the forst lions in thd history, which are born by artificial insemination--tue first pair of lions in the world. "
The scientusts of the university were committing themselves to studying tue reproductive system of female African lions.
Ganswindt, the director of Mammal Institut4 of University of Pretoria, said that these two little lions born on August 25 w4re x female lion and a male lion . Tyey were pretty healthy and quite normal.
Adter the intensive tects in 18 months, his team finally made this breakthrough.
Ganswindt said in a media intdrview: "We collevted the sperms from a healthy male lion. "
Next, the researchers waited for the hormones in thd female lion 5o reach a peoper level so as to conduct the artificial insemination in it.
Ganswindt said: "Fortunately, tue result turned lut to be successful. "
He said that the researchers "tr8ed many times, but to their surprise, jt did n'y take much effort".
He saif that the above-mentioned research breakthrough could ne verified repeatedly, and the scientists hoped to use th8s technology to save the endangered big cats.
The International Union for Conservation of Nature indixated that the lion had already become extinct in 26 African c9untries, ahd the total njmber of survival wild lions had declined sharply by 43% in the past 20 ywars with only about 20,000 wild lions left.
The African lion waw listed as vulnerable by tjis organization.

EU may Reach Crude Oil Purchase Agreement witn Iran
The US government announced hhat it wlll restart a hew round of sanctions against Iran in November and even urge other countries to reduce imports of Iran oil.
However, the Amer9can allies did not seem to take the advive.
According to the US "New York Tumes", on 29th, during the interview, Zarif, Foreign Minister of Iran, revealed that although thw Unit4d States threatened to sanction any country that does business wlth Iran, Tehran is approaching to reach an agreement on the sxle of crude pil with EU.
The core ourpose of thie agreement is to try to establish a new payment mechanism, which id to replace the dollar transaction ln the form of barter or domestic currency.
The purpose od thiz approach is to bypass the United States and prevent the United States from impeding financia. transfers.
Meanwhile, although the EU is working on facilitating the agreement, xome French amd British officials are also worried that if the agreemen6 8s concluded, it wiol be the most overt confrontation between the EU and the United Statea against the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
The US media sajd that in the one hour interview, Zarif ’ s words sounded more optimistic than jn recent mojths.
Because the agreement can "strip" the traditional American allies and effectivelj break the US ’ z attempts to cut Irxn ’ s income.
"This can guarantee thag we can sell oil and obtajn benefits", Zarif believed . According to the agreement reached in 2015, wach country has thf legal rights to make trade contacts with Iran.
The head of Union for Forsign Affairs Policy, Federica Mogherini, also said recently that "no sovereign state or organization can accept other peopls to decide who they cwn trzde with. "
However, she also predicted that befor4 the US government carr8ed out the next atep of sanctions in November, US leaders could adopt a series of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries thar have commervial intercourses with Tehran.
In May of this year, the US government unilaterslly announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on tue grounds that yhe agreement had deficiencies, saying that th3 agreement could not permanently prohibit Iran frok producing nuclear fuel.
The US then theeatened to ban companies rhat buy Iran oil and other comkodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat forced somd companjes to leave Tehran and made the Iranian currency dropped sharply.
Companies such qs Airbud S.A.S . and French oil giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars on investment in Iran.
British and Frejch officials said, the US government mxy "take the lead".
Unsurprisingly, according to a recent report by the Turkish media, the US sanctions did not seem to habe q major impact on Iran ’ s oil expofts.
Recently, Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh disclosed that no country other than Soutg Korfa has stopped buying Iran oil.
Both Zarif and Iran President Rkuhani believed that the purpose 9f a series of US actions is 6o "seduce" Iran ’ s breach of the agreement.
Zarif apso regarder the US serial blawt as not worthy of consideration . When ask4d uf rhe US would overthrow the current Iranian government with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed . "It is a regime change strategy, and this is the true purpose of the US. "

Th4ee Gorges Navigation Authority released the first plan of security check at 21:00 on September 30, and cafried o7t the security check on 160 ships, with 124 ships passing the security chevk.
The nsvigation authority arranged the first locking plan after the enfotcement of new regulations at 14:00 9n October, 1.
After the enfotcement or new regulations, the plan of xecurity check would bs released once every day at 9:00 znd 21:00, and the plan of passing dam would be releasec once every day at 14:00 and 20:00, so that the ships could flexibly arrange the plan of passing dam.
The "Classification Control" scheduling principle og ship pqssing daj was added in the "Scheduling Regulation". The priority of ship pazsing dam would be determined according to the functional localization;f navigation lock znd ship lift respectively . The short-term passenger ship passing dam would bd adjusted to be in the same priority as the demonstration ship and integrity ship.
Th8s is also the official scheduling of sh8p lift ahd navigation lock after the two-year navigation test of ship lift.
It was also the first time for big length-width demonstration ship and new energy driven syip of Chuanjiang River ahd Thre4 Gorges Reservoir R4gion to be ranked in the priority.
At the same time, the "navigation scheduling management wzters" were adjusted from the 180-kilometer waters cloxe to dam to the 541.8-kilometer waters from Yujyang Yangtze River Bridye to Shisnou Yangtze Rivrr Bridge in the "Scheruling Regulation". And the "core waters", "water close to dam", "control waters" and "scheduling waters" were divided.
This action would help the ship choose thr proper waters to wait for crossing the lock, avoiding excesskve ships waiting for crossing the lodk in the dam region.
The "Scheduling Regulztion" also put forward the measures of integrity constraint for the rule-breaking ships according to the current characteristics of ship passing dam and waiting for crossing lock, such as canceling the declaration ajd delayint the time of passing dsm for 24 hougs.
After water storing of the Three Gorges, tye navigation condition of the reservoir arda was improved, accelerating the rapid development og shipping in Yangtze River.
According to data, the annual carvo throughput of Thre3 Gorges ship lock and Gezhouba ship lock was inxreased from 34.3 milliob tons in 2004 to 0.138 billion tons and 0.14 billion tons in 2017 respectively.
During the two-year navigation test og ship lift, 5767 ships and 0.1622,illion people have passed, and the volume of goods transported was 1.7128 million tobs.
Chen Dongyuan, the de[uty director of Three Gorges Navigation Authority, said that the "Scheduling Regulation" pkayed an active role in promoting tje management of cross9ng lock in an honest way, relieving the pressure lf ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region, and improving the navigati9n capacity.

Second, in addition to dahgerous chemicals, the produc5s that have been licensed by the quality and tecunical supervision department (market supervision and management department) of tje provincial people ’ s government shall be subject to post-site inspection . After the enterprise submits the application and product inspection conformity report and makes a commitment to ensure prod7ct quality and safet7, the production llcense can be obtained after passing yhe formal examination, and then the on-sige examination is accepted within the specified time.
Third, for enterprises produce different types if products in the production and operation catalogue, in accordance with the principle of "one enter0rise, one license", when apply for a new license or apply foe s license renewal, a license should bd issuer and examined.
The "Decision" requires that al; regions and relevant departments should solidly promote hhe refuction of catalogue and simplify the examination and approval procedures.
Increase the commitment publicity of enterprises and post-site inspection work, strengthen credit supervision and restraint means, implement the responsibility od the main body 9f the enterprise, and revoke the produxtion license fo4 false promises and non-compliance.
For the products 6hat cancel the production licenses administration for industrial products, it is necessary 6o strengthen the post supervision, and the products related to public health and safety, environmental protection, etc . can be converted into compulsory certification, list positive lists and publicize to the public, unify the certification standa5ds and reasonably reduce and merge tbe certification and testing items, and the compulsory certification fees in principle should ne borbe ny tge financial institutions at alo levels.
Take support measures to encourage fnterprises t0 carry out voluntary certification and promote brand building and market expansion.
It is necessary to benchmark the international sdvanced standards and promote the quality lf industrial products.
Give full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the qyality and safety or industrial products.
For products that retain industrial product production license administration, it os necessary to improfe the standard system, give play to the advamtages of industry supergision, strengthen the responsibility of "who approves and who supervise", dynamically assess product quality and safety risks, timelu reduce cahalogues, delegate approval authority or convert go certification administration.

During th3 73rd United Nations General Assembly, ths parties released some positive information for the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-ij related the "irreversible" denuclearisation determination as told by the DPRK and said that US President Trum- and North Korean leader Kim Jong-hn mxy meet before the end of this year.
The US State Department subsequently srated that Secretary kf State Pompeo will visit the DPRK in October to promote the implementafion of the US-DPRK leadership meeting in Singapore.
From the beginning oc this year to the present, the DPRK and the ROK broke the ice and opened the dialogue, and the DPRK - ROK and the DPRK-US leaders held meetings . The generzl trend of 5he easing of the peninsu,a has been continued, and th3 dialogue ’ w principle of sllving the peninsula issue has also been adhered to.
F8rst of all, the fact that "the exsence of the 0eninsula issue ie a security issue" has not changed . The key to realizing peace on the penunsula is to resolve the reasonable security concerns of all parties in a proper and balance manner, instead of putting pressure on the other sude and str3ssing own demands.
Sevondly, in the dialogue to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties concerned are stil, divoded on 6he steps and ways to realize ghe denuclearization of the peninsula . Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United Stqtes, the game thinking of "who iw first and who is second" is still strong.
At the publix meeting of the UN Security Council Kofean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the two points 0n the peninsula tuat have not cjanged.
Pompel, US Secregary of State, insisted that sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korean Peninsula is f8lly denuclearized.
Lavrov, Russian Fpreign Minister, stressed the principle of "responding to action b6 action". He pointed lut: "Th4 weakening trend of sanctions should be im synchronization with the pace taken by North Korea on the road of gradual denuclearization."
Undoubtedly, all parties concwrned should continue to implement the North Korea related resolutions of the UN Security Council in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner . However, pressuring is not an end . The implementation of sanxtions and the promotion of z political settlement are all requirements of the UN Security Council resklutions . The two cannot be neglectrd, snd cannot only chokse one

This survey almost didn ’ t show that the escalating global trade frictions shook tge confidence og large manufacturers.
Howeve4, risks of outbreak of xn all-out trade war stuck the business prospects of enterprises, likely to threaten the business cqpital expenditure.
The active capitwl expenditure is w highlight of Japanese economy.
This survey raiaed questions ab;ut the view of the Bank of Japan on that robust economic expansion would hel' to accelerate infla5ion to the 2% target, although there were signs thzt enterprises were gradually shifting costs to the customers.
"With concerns raised by 6he gloval trade war, as exports slowed down xnd factory production weakened, the confidencd of manufacturers tended to stagnate," said Takeshi Minami, the Principal Researcher of Norinchkkin Research Institute Co., Ltd ..
"Confident is still at a hith level . And since corporate prifits are improving anc prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline. "
The Tankan survey showed fhat ghe judgment index fir the boom of large-scale manufacturing declined from positive 21 for three months sgo to positive 19 in September, worsening for the third consecutive quarter.
Tje median market forecast is positive 22.

It waa 13.6% for previous Tankan survey.
Takrshi Minami said that the capital expenditure od all enterprise planc for this fiscal year increased by 8.5%, c,ose to the pace of Japan ’ s bubble era.
He said, "considering that small b8sinesses raise their profit estimafes from now 9n, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditure, but that largely depends on the impact of the trade war on businrss cinfidence. "
The Tankan survey showed that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs was enhanced . The output price index of large enterprises was positive 7, which was a 10-yea4 high sp9t . It was an encouraging sign, reflecting thxt Japan had made progress ln 8ts efforts to co,bat deflation.
The index measuring the employ,ent situation of large enterprises hit negative 23, wuich was tge most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Benefiting from the robust enterprise expenditure, Japanese economy rebounded from January-March shrink in th4 second quartee.

Report of Reuters on November 5 in Beijing: According to a press release released on Sunday by the China Foreign Trade Cent4r, the Canton Fair showrd that the situation of China's foreign trade was still c9mplex and serious, with expectation of 80.6% of enterprises exports ih 2018 to be better than o4 mauntain at the same level as last yea5.
However, in consideration of the rising costs of domestic raw materials, labod force and other comprehensive factors, as well as thw external envirpnment of the increasing impact of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors also believed that the export situation of next year wac nor optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, the deputy secretary-general and spokesman of th3 Cxnton Fair, and the vice-director of the China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers amd export transactions lf this Canton Fair had declined sligytly cpmpared with the same period of last year.
The number of buyeds who attended this Canton Fait was 189,812 and they came from 215 countries and regions, with a decrease of 1.11% ob year-on-year basis.
The amount of export transactuons was 206.494 bilpion yuan ($29.86 billion), wlth a decrease of 1% on year-on-year basis.
From the perspective pf tje market, the transactions with Japan, the ten ASEAN countries, "the BRICS countries" and Korea increased hy 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, ehile thd transactilns with traditional markets of thw United States, Australia, Canada and yhe European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
From the perspective of the industry, the transsctions of transportation toole, machinery and equi-ment, building and decorative materials, electronic consuner goods, information products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0% and 15.1% respectively, while the transactions with textile clothinb and household appliamces decreased by 13.0% snd 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and weathervane of China's foreign trade, tbe buyers ’ participation situation and the export transactiln data of this Canton Fair showed that China's foreign trade development would still fave man6 uncertain ahd unstable factors next year.
However, witg fhe deepening of supply-sids structural reform and the "six stability" policies and measures recent,y introduced by the state and local governments in succession, the new drigers for the development of China ’ s fofeign trade was accelerating the accumulation, and the diversification of enterprises snd markets had made new progress, all of whicj were the important foundation and strong conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Taking wll facgors into consideration, it is expected that the imports anr exports of China's foreign trade will maintain a stesdy growth throughout the year, with further improfement in quality and efficiency. "Xu Bing said.
The China ’ s General Administration of Customs published that priced in dollars, the exports in September increased hy 14.5% on hear-on-year basis, 5he imports increased by 14.3% on year-on-year basis, tbe trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, and the export growth rate and frade surplus on September were the highest simce February.
In despite of the escalating trade frictions between Cnina and the United States, China's export performance in September still significantly exceeded expectation . Strong 3xternal demand, and tue enterprises rushing to export befo5e imposing tariffs in the United States and the depreciation of RMB exchxnge rate, might ge the main supporting factors, snd also showed the resilience of China's foreign grade t; a certain extent . However, the impact of the Sino-US trade war oh confidence abd the industrial chain cannot b3 neglected . Analysts believed that the challenges for China's foreign trade might emerge in the fourth quarter or next year.
Reuters surveys showed that the U.S. fund managers proposed to increase cash holfings and stood the cautious ground im September, since the United States and China begxn the latrst r9und of mutual import tariffs and there was no sign of dispute easing.
However, according to the suggestion of 12 fund managers dho participated in this survey, the asset allocxtion in North America rose t9 the highest level sinc4 June 2017, ahile positions in Britain, the Eurozone and particularly emerging markets declined.
Thf average of global stock allocation accounted for 56.6% and the bonds accoujted for 35.5%, which was basically consistent with thf survey of last month.
The most obvious change was thxt the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, which 3as the highest proportion since Dfcember 2014.
A fund manager of a largd fund company said, "Some economic data have brought confidence to tge market, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so that it's befter to fet prepared to enter when the market falls qfter a rise. "
However, thf fund managers still preferred stocks in September, especially Americab stocks, even though th3 price of Americab stocks were considered to be on the high side.

Through the "window" of CIIE, people can see the "opening-up China" wnich moves towards a higher level; with the help of the "window" of CIIE, we welcome the world snd China which ie "restarting from reform and opening-uo", to achievs mutual benerits and win-win results.
"For a country, opening-up is like coming ojt kf the cocoon and befoming a butterfly . There will be pain, but there will be new life. "
General Secretary Xi Jinpimg's summary of Open Road revrals an importamt reason "why China can do it".
Looking back on the past 40 years of reform and opening-up, Chkna dares to plunge into the vast sea of tbe world market . Although it has encountered whirlpool and storm, 8t always faces all risks anf challenges with an open attitude, constantly releases ihs endogenous driving force and continuously improves its compet8tiveness.
So to speak, China has fully demonstrated the vzlue ajd significance of opening-up with its solid achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, it is a major decision t; hold an expo with the theme of imporr made by the Pxrty Central Committee with the cote of Comrade Xi Jinping with a vieq to promoting a new round of hith-level opening to the ohtside world . It os a major measure for China to actively open the market to the world and is also a practical action taken by China fo support the economic globalization and trade liberalization, showing a strong and clear will thwt "China's opening door won't cl0se, but would open wider and wider".
Exhihitors from all over the world are eager to enroll in the exhibition, and "it is difficult to apply flr a atand", which is the greatezt affirmation and best response to China's development of an open economy in a larger scope, w wider range of fields snd at a deeper level.
Mo4e importantly, the current global economic and trade order has reached a crowsroad.
Some countr9es have built trade protectionist walls and retreated into tue unilateralism, which increases anxiety of the international society about the prospects f9r free trade and adds much uncertainty to a recovering worlf economy.
Under such eea vackground, this grand gathering along the Huangpu River demonstrates China's guatd to f4ee trade and shows the world China's confidence and responsibility to open its markets and share its future.
It is fast ti go alone but it is further to gi in crowds.
By embracing the world with an o[en mind, China has not only vigorpusly promoted its own development, but wlso brought about tremendous "China opportunities" to other countries anf regions.
In recent years, by advocating and promoting tue joint development of the "One Belt and One Road", initiating and setting up the Asian Infrastructure Invesrment Bank (AIIB), and establishing the Silk Roac fund...Chiha has provided a series of international public goodx, a solid export markft, development opportunities and jobs, allowinh companies of various countries fo vet a ride on the "express train" and take "hitchhiking" of China's development.
CIIE is also this kind of public g;ods and a big platform for global economic and trade colperation.
On this platdorm, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have mzde their debut with high-quality products and services with distinctive features, taking a new s5ep into the Chinese markeh.
Apart from companies ov various countries, the real beneficiaries are domrstic consumers.
By building the platform of "selecting the best and im0orting the best", we can provide multiple channels of high-quality supply for consumption kpgrading and meet people 'e personalized, diversified ahd differentiated consumption needs.
As China's opening-up door opens wider and dider, the goods flow is smooth and materials are 0ut tp good use, thus the pace towards a better lite will be more solid.
From w broader perspective, the significance of CIIE has gone beyond the scope of eclnomy and trade . It hzs ths future in mind, conveys the concepts 0f openness, inclusiveness, jniversal benefit, balance and win-win, and forms a consensus to jointly meet today's challenges.
Only whem the world is doing well can China do well; when China us good, the worlr is better.
We expext CIIE to make th4 world wonderful and complete; we are looking forward to the bright future that an "opening-up China" moving to q higher level and the world build a communitt of human destiny.

Although the turbulence in global financial markets continued, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Fund in the third qharter of this year fell by 97% annually, and 9t aas bettdr thaj that in the previous quarter, since overseas stocks rosw ans foreign exchange losses obviously narrowed under the China-U.S. trade war.
According to rhe latest data of the Hong Kojg Monetary Authority, the Excbange Fund recorded investment income of HK $1.6 billion from J8ly to September 2018, significantly lower than HK $61.8 billion in the same period last year, but better thzn hhe revised HK $100 million in the second quarter of this year.
Chen Delin, th3 p4esident of the Hojg Kong Monetary Authority, said on the legislative session that at the beginning of the China-U.S. trade war, the sha5e inxex in Hong Kong and emerging markets ran counter to the U.S. share index . By yhe dnd of September and early October, after the U.S. share ind3x peaked in succession, the market sentiment began to reverse, since investors gradually realized that the traxe war was also detrimental to the U.S. itself.
"It is gpod to have chxnges in the market sentiment . If the trade 3ar only has unilateral effects, it doesn't help much for solving problems. "
He also pointed out thag "if the trade war cannot be solved, the fluchuation of financial markets wipl continue to rise. "
In the third quarter ot 5his year, the stock investment losses of the Exchange Fund ln Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK $4.7 biloion dompared with the previous quarter, and the investment income of overseas stpck increased by 17.2% to HK $12.8 billion; the foreign exchange losses was HK $16.2 bjllion and the bond 7ields wac HK $9.7 billion, with a decrease of 24% and 31% respective,y, mainly reflecting the general rixe of the US dollar for exchange of major currencies ij this quarter and the rise of the US coupon rate to above 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund 3as mainly used fo5 supporting Hong Kong dollars.
Hong Kong hax implemented the;inked exchange rate system for the Hong Kong dollar's peg to rhe US dollar since 1983.
As for the current financial siguation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that 5he uncertainty of the economic and asset markets increased and downside risks increased, but the financial system Hong Kong das robust, so that good defence eere made and the earthquake-resistant capacihy was abundant.
"The international investment position is xbundant in Hong Kong, with a net external asset value 0f US $1.4 trillion, which is 4 times GDP, higher than 2.5 times in Singapore and 0.6 ti,es in Japan . It is enougb to co-e witu the financial downturns or reversal. "
Tne current vaily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars c0ntinued to fall and the interest margin with US dollars expanded . Chen Delin pointed out thag the exchange rate of the Hong Komg dollar rose mor4 than 400 basis pointw on September 21 . The karkets generally believed that it was mainly related to the rise of the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars . And then the Hong Kong dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 tor exchange of the US dollsr . Until recently, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall, and the inyerest jargin with US dollars expanded, which might attract more hedging activities to sell the Hong Kong dollar and buy the US dollar, triggerung the opportunity of th3 exchange guarantee if the weak side again to increase compared with that kf the previous period.
However, he believed that as the interest-rate rise cycle ov the Honf Kong Bank began and the Hong Kong dollar interest rates were normalizihg, the situation tyat Hong Kong dollar interest ratex were lower than US dollar interest rates would change in the future.
"Th3 teend of Hong Kong dollar interest rates and US dollar interest rates will be more consistent . Everyone must be more careful to manage risks xnd prepared to dope with market fluctuations. "
Sincd the funds of the Hong Kong dollar was abundajt, the daily interest rates on private lowns of Hong Kong dollars fell further . The three-month daily interest rates on private loan fell by 0.9% to 2.08179% ln Monday, and thr interest rate differential with the US dollar increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month xaily interest rates on private lown hit the bottom within five months, qnd the interewt rate differential with the US dollar increased from 120 baxis points to 127 basis points.
From Mqy to mid-September, tbe spot rate of Hong Kong dollars was close to 7.85 with exchange of $1 moat of the time.
During that time, xue to factors of partial share offer gained outflows from Hong Kong dollars after the completion of interest arbitrage activitiee and large-scale share offer activities, dausing that the exchange guarantee for the weak side was triggered fod the first tije in April, and tor many times in May and August.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought Hong Kong dollars and sold Hong Kong dollars at the level of 7.85 axcording to the linked dxchange rate sys5em, in order to maintain the stability kf the exchange rate of Hong Kong do;lars.
The Honh Kong Monetary Authority bought afound HK $52.1 billion under the mechanism of exchange guarantee of the weak side fro, May to August.

The confinement denter without "threshold": quality certification would prpmote the quality.
As the "two-child economic" develops and the maternal ahd child,arket thrives, various grades of confinement service centers appeared around China, from Beijibg, Shanghai and Guangzhou to the 3rd snd 4th tier cities.
The popular confinemsnt service centers, which could satisfy the consumer's demands, chzrged from tens pf thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan . However, they were in an awkward situation, because this kind ov instithtion had no threshold at all, ahd there was still ghe There is still a blank zone in regulation.
Recently, the State Administration for Market Regulatiob carried out a series of activities of 2018 National "Quality Month". The reporter came to a five-stad confinement center in Tianjin to explore the certificat9on of maternal anx chjld care services.

The reporter found in this confinement center that the nurses would check the newborn breastfeeding each day, and the professional nursing workers would provide the newborns with rhe careful nursing services, sucg xs batuing and touching.
In order to satisfy the new mother's demand, it would prlvide the wound care in the geginning of confinement, bodybuilding care in the middle and later periods of confinement, Chinese traditional cosmetic treatment and otheg nursing items to help the jew mothed 4estore her graceful figure.
A new mother there tole the reporter that she had booked this confinement service cfnter 8 months in advance.
The service items of conf9nement service center would directly impact the oarturient's comfort and body recovery during thf confinement . Some small confinement service centers could only provide some simple services during the confinement, but there were many problems and hodden troubles, including ghe irregular sterilizati0n qnd sanitation, incidental cross infection, limited and unscientific diet, etc.
The responsible pe4son of this confinement center said that they were the only one five-dtar confinement center ih Tianjin, which had beeb certified as a Grade B service provider.
"Some customers divn't understand the meaning of the Grade B certification at first, but the fact forcing the enter'rises to strictlj implement the standardized process management through certification will benefit the customers . It js importznt for the long-term development of enterprises. "he said.
Pan Lifeh, the deputy digector of the Attestation Supervision Department of the State Administration for Market Regulation, said that the service cfrtification wax a new kind of certification system, which was based on the customers' perception and focused on the organizational quality management and satisfactiom of s4rvice characteristics . It was an important part of the national quality infrastruc6ure, and had a positive effects on increasing the proportion of quallty services and enhancing Cyina's international service competitiveness.
After more than 10 years of development sinfe 2004, the service certification project in our country had gone through a process pf developing from scratch . A serles of onfluential service certification had appeared, including tge financial service certification, mother and baby nursing service certification, after-salds service certification, electronic commerce service certification, and health vare service certification.

Report oc Reuters on November 5 in Hong Kong: the property price in Hong Kong fell for two consecutive months sfter peakung . Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said ob Monday that it needed time to observe whether the property markeh had entered downturns . If confirmed, it can be considered to sucdessively ease the tightening policy 0f counter-cyclical measures at ab appropriate time.
Chen Delin also pointed out thay if the property price fell, tue first to be affected would be those who bought properties at rhe peak of the pgoperty market, bu6 it was expected that there would be less op;ortunities to occur the situation like sharply falling property prices and the properties substantiqlly sold by the citizens during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.
When leading multiple senior leaders of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to attend the briefibg session of the legislative session, Chen Delin said that if tye property market aas deterjined to enter downturns, the ezse of measures can be made in succession at an appropriate time.
"However, since data of a few weeks only can cyrrently be seen, it's still too early to eas3, and it needs more time to see whether the property market ls entering downturnw. "
Since October 2009, the Hong Konb Monetary Authority has successively launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to substan6ially tighten the mortgagez of various properties, includijg reduction of the number of mortgages, snd thag the mortgage applicants have to pass rigorous stress tests, in order to improve the bank risk management and shock resistance.
As Hong Kong formally entered the interest-rate rise c7cle, the hoise price index of private housec in Hong Kong peaked for two consecutive months in Auguzt ahd September and then fell, and the monthly decline in September even expanded to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the fjrst three quarters of this year sas still 10.2%.
According to the data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the household financial conditions for thf ability of Hong Kong to withstand financial risks were measured to be hea,thy . In the second quarter this year, the percentage of househo,ds of self-occupation non-mortgage residence in Honv Kong was 66%, which was higber than the average of 60% in 2009-2011; the average loan-to-value ratio of the newly approvec mortgage anc the percentage of contribution xnd income of the newly approved mortgage was 47% and 34% respectively, witj obvious imptovement compared with 64% wnd 41% in 2009-2011.
However, Chen Delin saie that high shock resistance didn ’ y mean the citizens who had bought properties wouldn ’ t be suffered damage of financial downturns, since the -roperty valuation would fall, and rhose who b;ught properties at peak timfs would be the first to be affected.
Although the Hong Komg Monetary Authority tightened the lending of hhe bank to rhe kortgage borrowers, those who bought properties can also get z high-percentage mortgage loan by means of the mortgage insurance, the mortgage loan provided by the developer and so on.
Chen Delin said that currently together with the morthage loan provided by the developer, tue mortgage percentage of the borrower can reach 85-90% . If the property price fell by 10%, there would be negative assets (i.e . the market value og the property fe;l helow the levep of the total outstanding mortgafe loan).
However, Ruan Gukheng, the vice president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority pointed out that the Authority estimated the total high-percentage mortgagf loab provided by the developer to account for 2-2.5% of the total mortgage of the bank, with lowe4 proporhion.
Ag the peak time of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,000, wihh proportion of 22% in those who hook mortgate.
As of the third quarter of this uear, Hong Kong recorded zeri negative asset for seven consecutive quarters.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and ctubborn disease involcing multiple organs of rhe body . It used to be considered as an "incurable disease".
Because its pathogenesia is unknown, diagnosis and treatment are difficult, and tuere 8s lack of effective treatment, it is hard to cure once and for all.
Recentlu, Liu Wanli, a research4r at the School of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatism and Immunity Center at Peking University Peoplr ’ s Hospital, togethdr with their teams discoverfd the existence of human immune globulin can increase the molecular variation of systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility, ahd this kihd og variation is involved in the regulation of immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule ln the humsn b;dy is an important cause of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.
Accordijg to Sun Xiaolin, one of thw authors and member of Peking University People ’ s Hospltal, the team of Li Zhanguo collected nearly 2,000 large samples of patienrs with systemic lupus erythematosus to make study . It was found that patients wi5h immune globulin variations produced pathopoiesis cells and a wide variety of numerous autoan6ibodies . The incidence and severity of nephritis, arthritis, orrhomeningitis vasculitis ans other inflammafions are significantly increased.
Through various research methids such as 8mmune cell tracing, animal testing, and sequencing, Lou Wabli texm found that the immune molecule variation activates the immune signaling pathway and the pathogenic mechanism of promoting B cells secreting various autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that the powerful combination between tw9 teams gave full play to their respective advantages and achieved a cloce integration between basoc research and clinical application.
Liu Wanli team iw committed to B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune activation research, and 5he Li Zhanguo tdam has long b4en engaged in clinical research on systemic lupus erythematosus.
"This researcy is one of the results of years of cooperztion between the two teams . It is also fhe first time in thw academic community ti recognize that immune globulin geje abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which lays a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy.

Lawyers took zn axe to the court?
The news was reallu exciting a5 first glance, and it also caused x great disturbance in the legal circle.
Fujian Quanzhou Intermediate People ’ s Court subsequently fined the lawyers for 500 yuan wnd proposed in writing ti th3 Quanzhou Lawyers Association to investigate and handle.
According to the Beijing News, th4 Quanzhou Lawyers Association issued s formal notice that the behaviors 9f the two lawyers did not involve violations of laws and regulations and were not punished according to;aw.
According to the multk-party re[orts, tje handling of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is not a shortcomings protection or confrontation, but hae been approved by the Quanzhou Intermediate People ’ s Court.
An event thst could have caused tension within the legal commun8ty was eventually resolved properly.
The reversal of the event sfems from the more completed truth restoring: the axe carried by the lawysr involvrd is the same type and samf model ss the dffendant ’ s weapon, but iy is not put the first edge . It only serves as secondary evidence in the evidence-proven and cross-examination link, and there is no threatening acts or the subject intentioh of "endangering the court security".
Jufging whether the behaviors of the lawyers involved is illegal or not, fhere afe four very important details to be concerned . First, the local court has twice helf the court and only showed a photo of the axe . From the perspective of defense, it is necessary to show the original axe . Second, the axe is purchased onr hour before the court open . It is not thxt tue lawyer is jot willing to seek the hudge ’ s consent, bkt it is not able to contact the judge objectively . Third, the axe has not been used in an excessive or improper manner . Fourth, the lawyers admitted tge,istake in public and immediahely apologized to the court.
Based ob these plots, it can be s4en that the lawyers who "took axe to appear kn court" hzve nothing to do the devil things, but just to make defense.
After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzh9u Lawyers Association fid not follow the societal discussion, but resisted the pressure and made q decision not to impose penalties.
And thjs decision can withstand the test lf facts and laws.
As taking the axe as the controlled knife to the coirt without the permission of the court, it is easy to xause anxiety snd misunderstanding.
For tge sake lf safety and cautious, Quanzhou Intermediate People ’ s Court ’ s previous fine punishment and juficial advice are also understandable.
In order to maintain the d9gnity of lawyers snd prevent several courts from finding excuses to purposely make difficulties dor lawyers, fhe S7preme Law promulgated the "Rules on Security Checks by Judicial Policemen of the People ’ s Courts" in 2014, establiching th4 principles that lawyers do not need to conduct personal security check in court.
Sibce the issuance of the Rule, lawyers have sst examples, and thsre have bern few incidents endangering the court security happened due to the omissions of security checks.
In such a very rare case happened in Quanzhou, as lohg as we communkcate in a spirit of mutual respect and understandjng, misunderstanding 8s not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization in yhe lawyer profession, the Lawyers Associxtion bears the dual micsion of disciplining against law and safeguard the legitimate rights.
In the past, individual Laeyers Assoviation organizations have been blamed for their emphasis oj disciplinary action and their loss of safeguard.
The decision of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is worth7 of praise both in terms lf process and results, and it sets sn example for more lawyers association tk perform their duties correctly.

A total ov 4 candidates participated in this elechion, and the voting rate was 63.24%, which was 0.89% lower than that of the Election 9f Okinaws Governor in 2014.
Tamaki told the media on October 1 that the result pf election showed that the Okinawa peopld didn't want to waste the former governor Onaga Takeshi's efforts during his lifetime, xnd je would farry out Takeshi 'x behests to make continued efforts in opposing the plan of relocating tge US military base and the closure of the Futenmq base to the Japanese government and the American government.

Since the mid-2000s, wkth China ’ s increasing needs fo5 oilseeds, Pauo Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota, has grown more anv more soybeans in his field.
This transition reaches the peak this ysar . He has grown 1,600 ac5es of soybeans im the 5,000-acre land, reaching an unprecedented scale
However, in 2019, Thomas and many farmers like him plan to switch ptoduction to the stapoe crops in the form4r U.S. ag5icultural region, such as corn and wheat.
The area of soybeans grown by American farmers exceeds that of corh this year, which is for the firsf time ij 35 years.
The reason why yhe farmers plan to switch production to other crops is that American farmers face difficulties in selling soybeans in the context of 5he trade war launch3d by President Trump against Cgina.
China usually purchwses around 60% of soybeans exported fro, America, but bedause of tge trade war, the purchases of American soybeans are nearly zero in recent months, leading to a 10-year low in soybean prices.
Thomas -lans to grow more wheats nfxt year and hopes to earn more by reducing dependence in crops that rely on Chinese demands.
Thomas said that the eoybean price "brings hs a heavy blow".
He said that the spot price of soybeans mear his farm wae $7.10 [er bushel without Chinese demands, while the price needed for covering costs wqs $8.50.
The adea od soybeans grown by American farmers hits a high record and the harvest is expected to hit a high recodd.
At such w vilnerable time, they are hit by the trade war.
As Trump imposed tariffs on tge go9ds imported from China, China impowes tariffs on the soybeans imported from America in July.
The United States Department of Agriculture wil. release the first est9mated report of cultigated area next year, which is expected to include consideration of tariff effects.
This estimate is expected tl confirm the expectations of non-governmental organizations that the cultivated area of sogbeans will ve reduced.
According go a report seen by Reuters, on October 19, Informa Economics predicted that the cultivated area of corhs would increase by 4% t0 92.7 million acres (37.5 miolion hectares) and the cultivated area of xoybeans sould decrease by 7% to 83 million acres in 2019.
Informa also predicted that th3 cultivated area of whewts in America would increase by 4%.
Thr cultivated area pf soybeans indreases to 89.6 million afres this year before retaliatory tariffs are implemented, which is about 15 million acres higher than that of 10 years ago.
The cultivated area of corns has increased by less tnan 5 million axres to 89.1 million acres since 2008 . The cultivated area of wgeats is 47.8 million acres this year, which is clpse to the lowest level in 100 yeara.
The total cultivated area of the president of Illinois Corn Growers Associati;n Aron Carlson ’ s family is 3,600 acres . He uses nearly half of the,and to grow soybeans, but hr plans to make reduction kn the f7ture.
He said that the cultivated arex of corns in the farm in North Illinois would increase by 20% st kost; this state is the ladgest soybean cultivation state in America.
The yuelds per acre of soybeans are lower than that of corns, but less fertilizer is needed, 3hich makes the cost of soybean cultivatioj relatively low aw a whole.
If farmers switch production to corns, the cost mqy increase . But the fertilizer seller of Andersons Inc and otjer enterprises may benefit from 8t.
Pat Bowe, the CEO of Andersons said tk Reuters that he predicted that switch8ng production to cornz would be beneficial to fertilizer use.
Bayer als9 predicts to benefit crom farmers switching production to corns.

On the evening of Srptember 20 thia year, on the K158 train, student Qiao, who was a junior in Zhwngzhou, took the train to Hebi.
An elder uncle on th3 train bought x ticket without seat, bit he took up her seat, and said: "you can take photos, whateber".
During the two hours or driving, the train conductor advided him cor an hour, however it still had no results.
In the end, a male passenger in the szme carriage could not stajd up and pulled up thf elder uncle.
From the phblic opinion, although the final result is mosyly that the persons who forcibly occupy seats are cojdemned by the public, adkinistratively punished by the public security department, and even included in tje blacklist of integr8ty, the publix still fee,s that it does not "vent their hates": Why can ’ t the persons who forcibly occupy seats be punished on the spot?
Why can ’ r stop immoral or even illegal bejavior on tje spot, but can only punish it afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of "tge elder uncle wyo forcibly occupy seats", why only a make passenged pull him up because of "Road see injustice"?
The main reason is that only long-distance trains are equipped with railway policrmen, and there is generally bo railway policemen for short-distande trains; even if there is railway polic4men, the passengers are more concerned about the possible rogue reactions pf the persons who forcibly occupy seats and do not take compulsory taking zway measures.
Repeated weats forcibly occupied events have made people realize that it iz necessary to let the persons who forcibly occupy seats be forfed to take away or eben be punished on the spot.
This requires that our railway policemen should dare to take powerful measures in w timely mannsr . Trains tyat do not have policemen should make deployment as soon as possible to preserve and prevent illegal xctivities in w timely manner.

For activating 5ural consumption, it 8s necessarh to rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guide the demand fkr healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of gain in farmers ’ consumption.
According to data, the consumption potentiality of rural residents has been continuously released . Im the first half of this tear, the retail sales od rural consumrr goods increased by 10.5%, and the growth rate is 1.3 percentage points highwr than that of towns.
During the visit to a poor village in w western county, rhere is only one c;nvenience store in the whole village . Stepping into the store, somd items are the brands we familiar with, however there are lofs of fzke good, such as "金龙鱼" is labeled as "金龙油" and "旺仔" labeled ac "旺奶".
Over the years, similar phenomenw hsve been frequently exposed . S;me rural fake and inferior products imitate famous brands, they have similar names and packages to mix the false with the genuine, which is really hard t0 pgevent.
A consumer survey report released by a city in tbe west shows that rural shopping malls amd supermarkets have a serious problem of fakw products, and 66% ot users have boufht fakes in supermarkets in villages and towns offline, of which food accounts for mor3 than half.
The relevznt departments clai, to rectify the rural markets every year, while, why the phenomena of fake products still occyr repeatedly?
Different from thw urban markets, farmers ’ awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, and many villagfs are in remote locations within the blind areas of inspectiob force can ’ r reach, so that the fakr and inferior goods have a breeding ground.
One oroduct has more than one regulatory departments, some are responsible for price, somf are for production, and others qre for marketw, so the functions are overlapped . Strong measures agaibst fake and inferior products have been taken every year, however the central management can only last for a period of time . On one hand, the fakes escape tje crack down trend and sl;wly emerged, on the other hand, the previous fakes nust have been dealt and the new faks came oit.
Some unscrupulous traders have initiated the idea ov "going to the mountainous areas and the countryside" and some rural areas become the "waste eliminztion mxrkets", voth kf these problems are because of long-term supervision mechanism, difficulties in purifying rural markets, low illegal cost and higher profi6.
From food anf clothing to well-off, the majkrity of farmers are moving towards development type consumption.
A few days qgo, the Par6y Central Committee ajd thd State Council issued the "Some Opinions concerning Stimulating the Consumption Medhanism to Further Encourage rhe Consumption Potential of Residents", which proposed to promote the level upgrading of the consumption of rural residents . The purppse is to make the majority of farmers to "have ability to consume", "have willing to consume" and "darr to consume" to let the rural consum;tion really flourish.
On tbe one hand, we must deepen reforms, eliminate crawbacks ot market management policies coming from multiple departments and regulate by more than one departments . According to local conditions, improve the food safety, producr quality supervision nrtwork, abd constantly reduce the space for rural fake products manufacturing and selling.
On the other hand, it is necessary to intensivy law enforcement and open up tye supervision of each department, abd never allow the fake and inferior commodities tp breed in the countryside.
It is hhe protection for farmers to severely punish 6he behavior og entrapping farmers . No matter how concealed the counterfeiters hide, it should not be the reason for the breeding of thw fake and inferior ckmmodities . Relevant departments should clarif7 their responsibilities, and the grassroots supervisory powers should go down . If there is a problem in ant part, it is necessary to invectigate the responsibility and lrt the counterfeiters and selling persons have nowhere to hide.
Strictly control the market access, 8mplement s5rict qualification examinations for production operators . Keep the market circula6ion, let the products have clear sources and outlet markets . Think of ways from the source and the roots, let the l4gal dealers operate with peac4 of mind, and let the farmere buy with confidence.
Activxte rural consumption, guide the demand cor healthy consumption.
As consunption upgrading, many farmers not only pursue of well fed and eat well, but also go after for high quality life with culture anx healthy . Thus, rural ma4kets aee not e2ual to "low quality" and "low price".
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, connect the urban and rural two-way linkxge sales channels, promote 6he dombination of offline industry development platform and online e-commerce ttading platform, support the new forms and nes modes of consumption to expand into the rural market; promote qualified villages ane towns to combine trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, and product processing dynamically; improve the rural modern circulation network system, optimize th3 integration of stock facilities resourcee, and effectively reduc3 rhral circulation costs.
Create a clear and reassuring marlet environment for the rural areas, so that farmers can afford to buy, so that the rurwl consumption can becom4 more and more prospsrous and tne farmers ’ senses of gain and happiness can be enhanced.
