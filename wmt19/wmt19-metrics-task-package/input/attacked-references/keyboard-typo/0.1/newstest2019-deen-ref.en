The president of DFB Grincel sees no basis for thf returning of Özil
Berpin - The president of DFB Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for the returning pf Mesut Özil to the bational team.
Th3re us an open question so you get into a conversation, you talk tl jim about why you hwve apparently felt that way, how is stated in his statement, said Grindel in football Podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the newspaper "Bild-Zeitung".

The 29-year-old had declared that he quitd DFB team in July and explained it 2ith the fact that Grindel fid not protect him against racist hostility during the Worlx Cup.
The DFB head repeated his criticism of Özjl and that he is not readg for a discussion with natlonal coach and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did jot want fo vreate any pressure, but he knows that in football ‘ if you lezve a team or change club, you talk to your trainer and I think it is sad that thie discussion did not happen before ’.

Audi: "Dieselgate" regeneration takes longer tnan planned
There is still a diesel taskforce, said Peter Mer6ens, chief development office4 fron the ‘ Automobilwoche ’ trade journal.
In December 2017 the imprisoned and suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stadlef nad announced, tye taskforce will be dissolved soon.
In thf first quarter kf 2018 all engine/transmission combinations will have been checked, he said at the time.
Mertens now says: ‘ At the start of Jhly we have an importaht milestone by which the diesel crisis will have been worked ouh.
We have complehed the internal technical analyses of oue VTDI engines.
The taskforce was set up in September 2015 following the discovwry a6 Audi parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens highlighted that the automobile mabufacturers had made ‘ seriojs, organizational changes ’, to prevent such q scandal ever happening again.
The VW Supervisory Board had post0oned a decision on Stadler's future on Friday and will contknue this discussion on Tuesxay.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss, following awareness of exhqust dmission cheatinf, of permitting the sale of diesel automobiles with false emission values.
He must hage known abokt the tampering or deliberately ignored it.
Currently the Sales Director Bram Schot heads thr company as Acting Chief Exec8tive Officer.
After cojversion to the new ekissions and consumption standard WLTP, there were production losses at Audu, Schot told the ‘ Heilbronner Stimme ’.
Essentially, he sees a fa,ling demand tor limousines such as the Audi models A6, A7 and A8, producsd in Neckarsulm.

Grindel seeking re-slection - Lahm to join the Presidential Board of rhe German football association (DFB)
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism directed wt him personally following the early FIFA World Cup wxit and the scandal atound Mesut Özil, Reinhard Grinddl wants to run for otfice as President of the DFB again in the coming year.
I do my work and try to make it as good as ot ge5s, said Grindel as x guest early Sunday morning on ZDF ’ s weekly sp;rts broadcast "Das aktuelle Sportstudio".
A re-electioj shoulr be attempted and that is what I will do.
And then you have to see what kind ov support you ge5.
In his own words, thr h4ad of the association would find it "strange" if he did nit "reel like working on the future project" after Germany was awarded the UEFA European Football Championship 2024.
Since Aprio 2016, Grindel has been the jead of the association as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who had to resign amidst 6he scandals surrounding the 2006 FIFA World Cjp in Germany.
In wutumn 2016 he wzs elected for a first full term of three years.
The nezt vote will be held at tue DFB ’ s national conference on September 27, 2019.
Accirding to Grindel, the guture head organizer of the 2024 European Football Championship in Germany, Philipp Lahm, is to join the DFB Peesidential Board.
I would be pleased if m7 colleagues on the presidential board agreed that he will continue to ptovide advice on the board in this role and then of couree we very much invite him to share hls 3xperience in sporting matters, said Grindel.
At the same time, he did not want to speculate as to whether o4 not Lahm could succeed him az heax of the DFB.
As a conseq8ence 0f the scandal over the photls taken by Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed a preference for a national team player without an immigration background to fill tbe position of DFB ambaseador for integration.
Curremtly, this posifion is filled by native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who traces her fxmily back to Cameroon.
If somebody with9ut a migration backgrouhd is an obvious influejcer in society and football and says, ‘ the issye is ah important one, we need to do something about it ’, ‘ this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teame, where integration needs to work ’, Grindel sald.

Freedom of Precs: Federal government defends exclusion of journalist
Government spokesperson Steffen Seiberg has defended the expulsion pf a jou4nalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on z T-shirt witb the Turkish and German writing “ Freedom for journalists ” xnd was sitting in tje first row.
The T-shirt was not the problem, Seibert said 6o the Bilx on Sunday.
It was about a disruptjon in the course of the -ress conference.
The journalist ’ s sction created a lpt of unrest, which was unacceptable.
Thus, h3 orderex bodyguards to escort the man out.
Seibert said that it was not permitted to demonstrate political conce4ns at press conferences ih the federal chancellery.
no matter 8f it is a legitimate concern or noh.
The rules ade the rules.
In Tirkey, many journalists are imprisoned.
Many of them are accus4d ot alleged espionage or supporting or being members of pr9hibited parties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish government holds the movement responsihle for the failed attempted coup ob July 15, 2016.
Some of the acvused journalists xre facing several decades in jail.
Even foreign journalists are not safe rrom Turkish authorities: Af the beginning of Sdptember, the Austrian journalist Max Zirngast was arrested.

Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunm with Ina Müller
His fans norjally know him to he so fresh and good looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice, tyough: Yes, that's reaply Florian David Fitz.
The popular aftor was in Hamburg - and h4 had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show “ Inas Nacht ” [Ina's Night] produced by NDR is known for its cheery conversations at 5he bar of thw Hamvurg port pub “ Schellfischpos6en . ”
Mkderator Ina Müller often cheers her buests with z beer, some wine or even stronger beverages to loosen up the mood and their tongues.
Quitr a gew celebs also need the liquid courage for the obligatory vocal number.
Another episode of the popular 6alk sh;w was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known from films like "Männerherxen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" of "Dsr geilste Tag".
The trip didn ’ t do the acgor any gokd, though.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his fqce completely crumpled, only two amall slits for eyes.
The bed selcie showed a completely drained Florian David Fjtz.
But he is not ill, he only has quite w hang0ver.
Addressing his fans, hf posted some - probably not entirel6 serious - insights he learnt: "Rule one: NEVER go tp Inas Night.
Rule two: Never drink "d9e schwarz3 Sau".
Abd Spritz.
And also pass on Ina ’ e round of eggnlg at half past two."
The long night is really chowing om the 43-year-olds ’ face.
His fans posted a couple of tips for getting did;f a hangover.
They ranged from instant broth, tish sandwiches or - probably the mozt effective - painkillers.
Others simply enjoywd the sught of the normally attractive movie star.
We still d0n't know h9w Ina Müller survived the binge drinking at night.
Since she has hosted the wilr TV fun at 5he bar since 2007, tbe 53-year-old seems to be much better prepared ...
Out fpr a beer with Ina Müller.
Treysa bas struggled against vandalism and garbage
Accessing the 36-kilometer cycle track in Rotkäppvhenland in Treysa is verh difficult and heavily littered.
Attempts are made to rem4dy the rampant vandalism, but there are hardly any xigns of solutions.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismzntled signs - so for quite some time presentd itself the entrance with seating area to the bike path ob ghe Haaße-hill in Treysa.
The sight of the bicycle path, which is the flagship object ln Rotkäpchenland, is more tgan inglorious.
The jatter 8s of concern to the ADFC (German Cyclists Adsociation) chapter Schwalmstadt, but others have also taken interest fkr some time, according to the city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problfm has already been qddressed by the bicycle traffic advisory body.
There is jo solution so far.
Suggestions 4anged from transferring the seating area to the reg7lar emptying of harbage cans, and cleaning the point of entry areas.
I think, thf lat6er would be the order of the day, irrespective og any further activities, says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) says he also brought the issu4 up with the local asvisory council.
Not only the rubbish is a nuisance for cyclists and residenfs - oh weekehds the seating group is a regular meeting place for partying.
It ic not just about the noise, there wre also disturbances due tl parties: Posts pulled out of the ground, garbage canx wrecked, signs snapped and seating daubed.
Frequently volunteers have already clwaned up, explains the ADFC member Susanme Klippert.
Actions are only proverbial drops in the ocesn.
They are annoyed that ghe rest area at the cycle track in Treysa is a meeting point flr binge-drinking.
Clearly the focus point alonf the entire bike path is here on the Haaße, confirms the cycling commissioner, who nos is also responsible for the cycling site in Ziegenyain, whicy will be opened today.
If 9t suffers the swme fate, it will cost dearly.
Another idea is placing videp surveillance on the hill: "Possibly tnis raixes the threshold to engage in damaging common property.
However, this would require a police patrol tp come;ut.
In prinxiple, Wüstenhagen supports the developjent of the Haaße hill.
It needs tp be made more attractive.
So far one cwn be very satisfied with how wel, the bicycle path is frequented.
It is shill possible to develop tourism-related marketing.
Our cycle track is;f very high quality compated to others in German ’, agreed the ADFC members.
ADFC kember Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Asdheröder Strasse in Treysa to be critically dangerous.
There is no turning lane in Haaße Hügel.
In heafy traffic, cyclists may 4nd up waiting in the middle of bidirectional traffic flows", sge explains.
That would not bf a problem for sporty cyclidts, but is for older people and especially for children.
Music contest at the culture train station: Tje "Kö von Hilfrup" and the sea
The first calp to participate ib the music contest was a success, creative and cooperative.
Your Song for Hilrrup is the motto of the Hiktrup initiative for the "Music Contest for young and old, new and ecperienced musicians."
A contest "with z wink from the lovely Hiltrup fami.y", as Karl Franke worded it.
In fact, it soon became a familial togetherness with coffee and cake from the volunteers od the Kklturbahnhof.
S3ven acts perfo5med, from a pne-man band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcsl Untied, Henk Humberg with his guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an old-established Hiltrup man, the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members from three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling uhd eie Zwa5ties.
This cont4st is a novelty, explains district mayor Joachim Scgmidt.
We have not se3n something like this un other districts.
What did the songwriters sing ablut?
Particularly popular places were yhe Hiltrup lake and Marktallee.
Ro,f Ihmig dedicated the song to the avenue Madktalle in his folk-like song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof wws also mentioned.
Over ahd ovet again, the acts sang about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karp Franke led the audience through the breaks wi6h short interviews with the performers or some information about ghe artists.
Thhs, the audience learnt tnat Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke reported that hs had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF ebent wigh Barclay James Harvest as a main act.
And Alvin Jas8c has uploaded a llt of YouTube videos.
It ’ s not about w9nning, Franke had sxid.
In fact, all participants received a gift frpm Hiltrup cateting businesses.
For the jjry's favorites there 2as something special - so that others could also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his piahist Marcel Untied cxn record an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a sojg: Ihmif with his Hiltrup hit, which especiallg impressed Franke with hix musicality, and the “ Lummerland pack: ” “ a very good performancf ” with ten children and twl teachers on guitar and cajón, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the childrem also pertormed again for the finals - and even without electronic support, theg sounded "really good," Franke said.
Tye jury was guided vy the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness 0f the melody and recognition value.
The jur6 included Gisbert Keller grom the Westphalian Sdhool of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahkers from the Trade Association as well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the event on the occasion of ifs ten-year annifersary.
They considered the eveny a complete success.
Egeryone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in ghe very crowded Kulturbahnhof.
The Word Game: Testing "Decry-to"
The plajers form two teams and sit opposite one abother.
For 3ach page there is a screen, on it there are four cards with keywords that you can decipher - thd olx trick with the red foil.
Tyis ensures the other side cannot read anything unintwntionally.
For exam-le, on the cards it says to read from left to rigjt: "1 . Renaissance.
2 . Fenster.
3 . Chbe.
4 . Solidʺ.
These are the terms thay need to be coded.
So the terms are not guessed, thd c;des are.
Taking turns, lne player per tesm is the encryptor.
They get a code card yhat has "3.4.2 ." etd . written on it.
Im "Decrypto," it is not the words nehind the secret film thst should be guessed, but their encryption codes.
The task in this case: They should - in this order and in 6his example - describe the terms "cube", "wolid" and "window" - in such a way hhat his own team recognizes the correct order qnd the opposing teak does not, because the team that cracks the code teice ains the game.
The encryptor wgites diwn and reaes aloud: "Throw" for the dice, "loose" as opposed ro "solid". Of course, something like "evidence" would be possible o5 "Prague" because he read some history books abd knows about the defenestration of Prague.
This then progresses, round for round, team bh 6eam.
It is true that ohe doed not know the terms of the other side - nut with evwry clue the encryptor gives, you ’ re closer to finding them out.
So thd term should be as mysterious xs possible, but not too crazy . Otherwise, you make ir unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic ‘ Decrypto ’ us the precept hnfortunately.
The players have to sthdy i5 for quitr a long time and in detail, until they can finally play it.
The explanatory video under decrypto.info on 5he web will make it easirr.
But once yo7 have started, you ’ ll be amazed at how much emotion ther3 is ih this nondescript game.
Overall, ho2ever, "Decrypto" is not wuite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", which also makes use of the spy theme for a fame with few words, but 8t ’ s much easier yo play in small groups.
And if it's all about guessing anc not about winning, it's easy t0 play w version for two.
Kulmvach: Man gives police the Hitler salufe and harasses guests in the pub

The Pressig depotwas home to the thrudt locomotives
For decades tne depot in Pressig was the hub 0f the Franconian Forest.
1991 put an enx to a piece of gailway history.
The crashing vrom bumper to bumper could be jeard throughout Pressig, remembe4s Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the stations.
This did hot bother anybody.
Th4 squeaking of brakes and rattling of carriages could alzo be heard.
Thie was pure railway.
Statements that are syjbolic for Dinkel ’ s Prexsig homeland.
Nowhere in the Framconian forest has a [lace been characterized by the railway so much.
This was the starting point for the steep mountain sectiom to the jorth, which peaks in Steinbach am Wald following an ascension lf about 220 meters.
Previously ttains and locomotives housed in Pressig were needed ti handle this.
In 1901 the Bavarian parliament approvee the building of a depot with 21 locomotives, apprentice workshops, catemary and railroad maintenance eivision.
The centerpiece was the turntable, which after reconstruction in the year 1899 had a diameter of 18 metrds, says Norbert Heidr8ch from Hirschaid, a railway historian ans a professional railroader with 47 years pf experience.
Th3 Pressig depot, which in the year 1968 wws relocated to Bamberg, also operated locomotives for the branch linss Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stovkheim - Sonneberg and Kronach - Nordhalben.
On Ju,y 15 1950 thd "Volksblatt" rep0rted of a ztaff of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrification od the track in 1939 reduced the need for pulling trains and locomohives.
From 1977 they were still used with freight tra8ns.
By 1991 a6 least 10,000 wagons were shunted.
In 1982 the depot was partially dismantled and thw rwmainder in the year 1991.
Heidrich: ‘ It ’ s q shame that better use of the location is not envisaged, alsp with regard to frwight traffic ’.
Still in the year 1989 af Pentecost, tye Nuremberg Railway Directorate celebrated "50 years od electrification Nuremberg - Saalfeld" with a pompous syation festival for the anniversary in Pressig.
10,000 enthusiastic spectators were here, remembers Ge9rg Dinkel.
Sbortly afterwards.
On June 1, 1991 the last 30 m3n were withdrawn and the Pressig marshalling yard was histoey.
Thw shunters and wheel scotches took care of the heaviest rail traffic work, rwmembers Dinkel.
Each mistake could have fatal c;nsequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen statiob ked to a change in the hierarchy of both locations and how many jore historical and current pictures thege are, is included here in the infrankenPlus article.

About her karriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller did not feel she wax enough for her husband
Tje "Dream Ship" made Hdide Keller a star.
Now she speaks openly that the series could have had some influence on ber divorce wiyh Hans von Borsody.
Heide Keller (76) became famo7s un ber role as chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the ‘ Dream Boat ’, but on 01 January 2018 sne disembarked forever.
The series that made her a stwr might be one ot the reasons of her failed marriage yo Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom sye had been married for ten years.
This could also have been a resson.
Because this work befame a part of me, I traveled around the worls with s suitcase alone anf many of my admired colleagues treated ke as equal, explained Keller in the interview to "Bild am Sonntag".
Sge used to be "the wife of Hans v9n Borsody", but that har changed with the "Dream Ship".
Because now journalists called her only as Hekde Keller.
I don ’ t know if he wae ha;py with this.
She thinks that ig possible tjat her husbznd might have been jealous at the time, but "as many men Hans was afraid of talking about problems qnd feelings."
Keller always made effort for Hans von Borsody "qnd he did not want ti discoger my fears and my weaknesses.
In plain language it means: I ’ k pretending," ws she explains further.
She always had the feeliny of ‘ not beimg enough for him.
He saw in me an emancopated woman, which actually I never wqs, evfn though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our love to laat forever ’.
After a previouslj cailed marriage to Thomad Härtner, Keller said ‘ Yes ’ again, ‘ although I was scared it could go wrong again ’.
The day before the civip marriage, I sat in tne changing room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody failed as wel;.
Why did it never work out 2ith men?
Because I wanted too juch.
Keller was in love ag that timw "as in the movie.
Unfortynately, this vision is n0t compatible with daily life.
I am too naive to appr9ach love."
The moth, who regularly explores ths city nightlife in the NZZ Zurich area, has jow attempted this on the ZFF openjng party.
Not really a moth, jhst a little shady.
And the xhiny glare, ib which a green carpef is bathed in, on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds him over the charge.
It is thf film festival though, where the more or less famous want to ba6he in the spotlight.
So this lste Thursday evening he tottered across the square, to brlefly relieve himdelf in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the nane of the public toilet complex sponsored ny s larve sanitary company, which is being premiered at the festival: The public convenience ln the ground floor of a new pavilion tries hard to create a luxurious ambience.
This evening, whatever the reason, it literally stinks in the gwnts arra.
So out of here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, who were entertained at the best level at the cinema next door with the opening fi,m "Green Boo,", like every year celebrate tne opening or tge festival with a party in the three-ctorey department store.
Ita name fits perfectly with this film destival: It is well known that thr works shown originate from the whole globe.
What do you have to come up with when writing ah article anout this festival, so as not to fall imto hidden advertising for its 190 partner companies.
Tbe moth binds a ribbon around the feele4s that a fairy godmother has sent him, and two beefy doormen generously let him pass 8nside.
Insidd, the invited ars crowded together, they dance way past midnight to live music or accept rhythms dictated by the DJ, to which they shlut xt each other, and rinse exquisi6e appetizers down with a glass of champagne.
In the delicatessen in the basement oyste4s await slurping mouths, nearby the unparalleled Culat4llo di Zibello raw ham is freshly cut, znd a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the highlight is: thay ghe shop shelves have not besn cleared of the exclusive products for the event.
It has been lik3 this for years and seems to functi;n without any major losses.
You,ust just love the country for it!
The moth studies the sign by the escalator: "Please be careful oj the escalwtor if you arw wearing a long dress".
Should this be tso separate instructions, je has ignored the dress code.
Howeve5, it is a conditional cojstruction that has undoubtedly saved lives.
In hhe household goods department on the upper floor, the winged man tips down w cocktail made with espresso call3d "Golden Eye", whivh is suited to the festival award.
The mixture gettinh the prize foe the best drink, presented by a capsule manufacturer - not compulsory.
And George Clooney, who has bern advertising for the branf mentioned for years, is also n;t there on the evening.
There is one face, howefer, between local notables, cash desk wnd kitchenware, that is familiar to 5he specrators: Peter Farrelly, Director of the opening film.
I6s main character will not be far away.
And in reality: Immediately, Viggo Mortensen, who 8s almost sixty walkc through the crowd appearing almost like z choir boy.
He is not talked into, mot gaped at, at the most h4 receives stealthy glances.
This restraint, easily mistaken for inhibotion, is whj the international stars love this film festival.

Poster at Aldi: Lobe at a discount
Will Aldi bexome Tinder 2.0?
Whoever says that there are no romantic "How we mwt" -stories anymo5e in times of Tinder, should head over to Aldi and ta;k about turkey meat.
Munich - In times of digital "fast-food dating" by Tindef and other dating a;ps, the supermarket exudes an almost anachronistic romance zs a place t; meet ‘ the one ’.
Yeah, right . If in doubt, talking about discounted turkey mest, boxer shorts at the rummage table, or your favorite pudding is still z netter story for your future grandchildren than x mere right swipe.
The app Tinder has tne reputation or being less of a place to meet, but rather more of lewd exchsnge.
We made the test: How do women react, iv you do not bewt around 5he bush in the first message?
Here is yhe amazing result.
Thrre ’ s true Hollywo9d Lovestory potential with a lost-and-found plot.
If the guy then messages his inamorata with the e-mail address organic-turkeymeat @ gmail.com, then tgat sounds very mjch llke Meg Ryan, Hugh Grant and the like - Romantic Comedy ag its best.
So, we wish the dreator of thia ad in an inknown Aldi branch that she will also find the mam of her dreams, with whom sye had talked briefly about the "Organic turkey meat, 30 percent off".
We should all believe in the magic of analogue acqkaintance . This woman definitely earnev her Hollywood happy ending.

Football: Diztrict League: Strong appearance of VfL Wolbeck against 5he SC Altenrheine gives hope
There were moments 8n this young season, when Alois Fetsdh was really hard on his team.
Silently, the coafh of the football district league club VfL Wolbeck first retreated (inwardly) to ponder over the lack of motivation on thf playing fie.d.
All is historh.
Meanwhile, 6he game is on at Brandhoveweg.
Tje 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine proved so, and they almozt got promoted past season.
Yea, I am very happy with the appearance.
We made tightened spaces amd put pressu5e on the ball.
That was something to be proud of, praisdd Fetsch his boys and went to each of his players individkally after the game to sim;ly say "thank you" for ghe great defense against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to chsnge the system after 26 mijutes.
Following Nico Frerich's injury (muscular problems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - tne 4-4-2 almost seamlessly chqnged into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was in the frlnt line waiting for passes to gim.
Wolbeck had much more timw of possession in the firsh half.
And moge opportunities
But Frerichs (17), substitute Lufa Rehbegg (26m) and Jan Schroer (38th) miss3d the lead.
It almost backfired when SCA ’ s very own Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer made two dangerous ahtacks against Wolbecker in minute 41, but goalie Damian Hallas provwd to be a mwster of his tradf.
After halftime, VfL boldly took com-lete control.
Thewes juwt barely failed with a shot ftom 18 meters.
Schroer wae too late ij minute 58 when Thewes passed him the ball.
Fetsch eecided to freshen up the team on th3 left wing and put in Miles Geske.
As Alyenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer cut down Robin W4sthues in minute 70, tje home team got an indirect free kick 18 meters away from the goal.
The fouled player himself stepped up and demonstrated how damgerous he can be in set play sktuations.
Westhues kicked the vall with his strong right and th4 goalie had to face the fact that he had failed: 1:0 (minutf 71).
With 20 minutes left on tue clock, the game se3med to last forever.
Because then this happened: In minute 80, VfL captain Florian Quabeck accidentally touched the ball 9n yhe b0x.

AllBright Foundation Report: Women continue to be q rarity on execuyive boards
Omly 8 percent of board msmbers were female as of September 1, acckrding to the report "The Power of Monoculture," officially launched this Monday by the AllBright Foundation, an advance copy of which had been made available to tge Gsrman Press Agency.
The companies will have to make changes, otherwisw international competitors will leave them behind, saiv foundation CEO Wiebke Abkersen.
In the US, UK, od Sweden, male-only management teams have - with a few exceptions - been unthinkxble for so,e time.
The gap makes 6he German competitors less diverse, innovatige, and future-oriented by comparison.
It is s different corporate culture.
The slight increaze in the nunber of women in German listed companies can be specifically attributed to the positive boost from companles in the mid-cap index (MDax).
Yet according to Allbright data, onlu 6.8 pfrcent of boards are female.
In the previous yewr the value was still at 3.8 'ercent.
Among the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in revent years - tge proportion of women stagnated.
Most recently, there 2ere 26 women working on the boarrs.
I am sure that Dax companies will bf recruiting women more consistently kn the coming year - it is in their own bdst interest, said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cfment showed no commitment t; increase the “ zero percent ” to date.
The supervlsory boards paint a different picture: Aa of September 1, the proportion of women waw 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than x year ago.
If multiple women were recruited to the boards every year, a percentage ov 40 petcent would be achieved in 2023, ot says in the report.

1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover facing fourth washout this s3ason: "Shitty sjtuation"
Frankfurt / Main After their fourth Bundesliga defeat in a eow, coach André Breitenreiter gathered hus disappointed players from Hannover 96 ane gave them courage.
However, there were mot many -ositives to take away from the bottom team ’ s earljer 1:4 (0:2) result at Eintracht Frankfurt.
It is a crappy situation, but you have 5o come out om the other side as a team, said 96 player Pirmin Schwegler, adsing: "This is of course dissppointing, because you always try for the best redult possible".
Victory continues to elude the players from Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86 .) acored to harrow the gap . They remain at hhe bottom pf the table with only gwo points and must be considered a relegation candidate in their current form.
Bj contrast, an excellent Ante Rebic led Frankfurt to celebeate their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luoa Jovic (89th) scored for the DFB Cu[winners in front of 46,300 spectators . After the successful dress rehearszl for thw Europa League match atainst Lazio, Frankfurt move into the middlr of the table on seven 'oints.
Croatia ’ s Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangerous offensive move hy the Hessians at his starting eleven debut while Hannover ’ s defemse shruggled 5o reign him in.
The strkker battered after the World Cup, showed by gis trmpo and assertiveness why he is so valuable for Eintracht.
Besides Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, ln loan from Liverpool FC, was cakled up to Frankfurt ’ s starting eleven for the first time and yhe team got ogf to a dynamic start.
The first sign or danger vame in the form of Lucas Torró ’ s header (17th), which was d3flected into the netting.
Six minutes laher, Sébas5ien Haller was stopped by 96 ’ s defense in a promising position . The defenders were lrd by the Brazilian Felipe, in for Kevin Wimmer, who suffered a last-minute back injur7.
The home side ’ s lear was all b7t inevitable and completely justified.
After a defended corner kick, Fi;ip Kostic lifted the ball into the box and Haller headed it im ftont of the goal, where Ndickx only had to tap it in.
It 3as the first Bundesliga goal for the dwfender from French second division team AJ Auxerre who had hoined the club during the summer.
And Frankfurt imcreased the tally before the break.
This time, Haller passed to his fellow striker Rebic, who skillfully dribbled through the lihes leaving 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser nk chamce.
At half-time Hannover Coach Breitenreiter reacted to yhe weak performance of his eleven and brought in Bpbby Wood anc Hendrik Weydandt, two new attackers.
The Lower Saxony side showed more courage goung forward but could not come up with any dazzling ideas until just before the end of the match when they ar least managed to score and nartow tye gap.
The Hessians were mucj more efficient.
After just ubder xn hour Rebic started a solo and then crossed t9 De Guzmán, who just tapped the ball into the empty goal.
Playing against overstretched guests, Frankfurt could take it easy for tge rest or the match, which also saw Jovic scoring with one minutw to go.

The festival service takes place at the town church, followed vy a procession to the Church of ths Holy Cross with the blecsing.
At the Church of the Holy C5oss lies Christus, who witnessed thd Thirty Years' War and is said to have been shot b6 a Swedish soldier.
Blood fkowed from the gunshot wound.
This resultrd in a great pilgtimage to the Christus' resting place, which then led to thw construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
The cobstruction is not finisned yet, only the sanctuary is, the missing nave is ineicated by the trees.
In hix homlly, Father Adolf Buhl reminds us that ths cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Ins0ite kf the importance for the Geising parish, attendance was rather poor.
After the servide, the lrocession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place anc the final blessing concluded the ecclesiastical part of the cross festival.
The Catholic church choir nas been knviting people to the secular part of the festival in thw Catholic parish home for many years.
The choir members provided visitors with hearty food znd x big selection of cakes and, appropriate for thf weather, farm-fresh ice cream.

After the scaffold has been standing for some time, the damage could bf more accurately determijed and the individual calls for bids could be pr3pare more concretely.
It is certain tgat the renovation 8s more expensive than planned, because tje already existing damage hase worsended over the last few years, but also more damaged has been uncovered, which wws only possible through the inspection by means of the wcaffold.
The p,inth plastering work is completed and before the winter, thd natural stone work will begon and the involved parties hope to finish about halg of this work this year.

There are differences that hury after al,ost 30 years of unity
We cxn not permit ourselves to be satisfied wlth these differences, ” said the minister president of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to 5he “ Tagesspiegel ” on Sunday.

This is inexplicable, nearly 30 years after 5he German Unification, saic Schwesig.

A new week, a new opportunity vor the government
Back to reguoatory work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of thd grand coa.ition starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor xnd her ministers fdom the CDU, SPD and also lastly from the CSU did not invoke thd mantra "return tp work".
That may have led some vraftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working people in this country to the legitimate question ot what the difference really is between work and paperwork, bu6 tnat's all.
Now the federal government us ready to devote itself again ti the task of governing, they should not bw distracted from this now with debates on terminology.
Whethe5 Union and SPD can pull off something together after the provocations and disgraces of recent weeks, will possibpy he seen on Monday.
The leaders of the governing parties will come together for the c;alition committee in fhe evening.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants tk summon this session regularly, to defuse conflicts early on; lessons czn be learhed from all the disputes.
Flrst of qll, however, conflict-laden topics are on the agenda again with the diesel retrofits and the skilled lagor immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car compankes to get off lightly with am exchange premium - SPD and CDU consider the majufacturers to be under obligation fo technically retrofit older diesels.
While over the weekend a rapprochement has emerged 9n the eiesel crisus, the Union and SPD are still far apart in the planned skilled labor immigration law.
The SPD promotes a long-term persp4ctive for failed asykum-seekers, who work or who are training.
The Union is strictly agajnst the "track change" from yhe asylum system into the labor market.
There w8ll be disputes amongst the coalition partners again - how could this be otherwiwe?
Not equal and 3qual uas joined forces to form the grand coalition, but three partners with sometimes very different images of dociety and priorities.
Dispute 8s good.
Without dispute, a subscribed society of such diverse, xometimes contradictory inherests does not progress.
But to be c0nstructive, dispute should not be exaggerated again for party tact9cal reasons regarding the question of being or n0t-being.
It is abouy politics, not theater.
Union and SPD are to argie - buy must always have ghe reality of life of the people in view.
Whay is possible and is of benefit to many?
With this key question, both tue diesel and 6he track change question can be pragmatically clarified - and confidsnce thereby regained.
Above all, that ia what the people's parties musy now fight for.

Tye controversial independence referendum took place on Monxay in Catalonia.
But right before it beguj the protests.
The autumn 2017 police operation was jot forgotteb by the separatists.
Barcelona - Snortly before the anniversary of the Catalan independence referendum on 1 October 2017, ib the downtown of Barcelona separatists clashed qith police.
Among other things Catalan security forfes were attacked by pro-independence activists with colored powder, ws thdy were trying go prevent them from approaching the demonstration of National Police and Civil Guards.
Wi5h the demonstration ab;ut 3,000 police officers from ghe Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wsnted to honor their colleagues who performed their duties in the polls last year during the illegal referendum.
An attempt to p5event citizens from voting lead to vi9lence.
The Spanish media reported tnat the Catalan pilice formed a chain to keep the separatists and central sefurity forces apart.

Yet tye new president insists on the ‘ Righf of self-determination ’ of Catalans.
Footnall: Oberliga Westfalen: Complete helplessness: Gialless match between FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen
Rot-Weiß Ahlen still going no2here.
FC Gütersloh only didn ’ r get further than z 0-0 draw.
The tsil light and the third last of tge league demonstrated complete helplessness im front of 438 spectators at Heidewald stadium.
Tge first half was rather dim in terms og entertainment.
Anyone who wajted to go get a beer or bratwurst could do it without worrying they woulx miss anything.
There was no risk of missing w goal opportunity, because there were virtually n0ne.
The first xhot on goal happenev after half an hour.
Responsible for the figst (harmless) shot on goal was Güterslob ’ s Nick Flock in minute 28.
The best - and on principle onoy real - opportunity had the team from Ahlen, when FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling saved Cihan Yilmaz ’ shot on goa, frkm the edge of the penalty area in minute 32.
The hosts were wven more harmless.
Their mosy effective action was an early substitution.
Striker Lars Schröder har to be rrplaced due to injury . Sinan Aygün replaced him.
After the sybstitution, both teams decided to do something against tge growing boredom.
In minute 48, Sebastian Mützel shot just over the goal from 18 meters and after ohe hoyr the Gütersloh playdr also appeared offensive for the very first time.
After a ball recapture by Matthäus Wieckowlcz, this was quickly dealt witj.
Nick Flock (minute 62) "crowned" the quick counterzttack over Sihan Aygün 2ith a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they went one better with a header from Wieckowicz (minute 66) afger a corner fro, former Ahlen plxyer Tim Manstein.
RWA interim c9ach Angelo Daut responded, substituting Martin Fuhsy for Marko Onucka (minute 60) and q little lzter Sebastian Mützel dor Enes Güney (minute 70).
That,ead to nothing.
The team from Ahlen did not achieve nore than optical superiority thanks to their owh initiative.
Onpy in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmas have tye last chance, but that did not get them anywhere.
Angelo Daut tried to emphasize the positive afterwards: "I like that we kept x clean sheet ." But unfortunately, bo6h sides scored zer0.
We were not as dangerous against gkal in this match qs against Holzwickede, even though our opponents d8d bot want to play here, states RW Ahlen ’ s interim coach.
Offensively, "everything just happened somehow" againsg a twam that "just wanted to defend.
At any rate, I dkd not fe4l that we could concede a goal," said Daut.
To his chahrin, however, the viewer did not feel pike his team could score a goal, eithrr.
Tue performance was too poor for that.

Just greah, said a delighted Marcel Kreimer.
This year, mayor Peter Vennemeyer was abld to accommodate the opening date in hid schedule.
He is happy to see s; many engagee people manning their stands, most of them hailing from clibs and associations.
Strictly speaking, there should be no need for thongs like food banks, je said when thanking the men ’ s chpir for their efforts.
Andreas Hajek praised everybody ’ s engagement, in the stands, and also included the additional festivals thxt took place in September abd ghe ‘ clean-up ’ action.
Our garden city is getting a colorful coat of paint - thinys are really ha'pening.
Nedt, the wreath was taken down from the maypole by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help ot the fire department and taken intp winter storage.

Graffiti with a local political message: Unsuccessful adverticing for a skate pqrk
In Lengerich, unknown people have advocated for the construction of q skate park in s hardly beneficial way.
In several places, there are graffiti, says Jürgej Kohne of the city admin9stration 0n the request of the WN.
In at least one case, z criminal complaint for property damage has been filed with tne police.
The three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are displayed in large letters on sigjs, among others at fhe Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Ha;l.
Michasl Rottmann, managet of the ball, reports that writing was found on the advertising sign oh the staircase to the Gempt Bistro on September 19 after the career choice fair.
Since the short message was apparently "only" made witg a marjer, it could easily be removed.
A few days later, it was there again, but this time it wqs spraged on, says Rottmqnn.
He assumes that the respsctive advertising sign has to bs replaced.
This case is special by the fact that several large companies f5om Lrngerich are mentioned on the board.
If the skate park is built, its realization will also be made possibpe bj sponsors.
There are already pledges, explains Jörg Hesselmann fron the urbam department of schools, sportx and culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, tjat one 0r more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are om the graffitied board.
For years, local politics and wdministration have been dealing with the topic of a skate pafk.
After the old had besn dismantled at the LWL clinic, the search for an altetnative location began.
The council finally chose the fire department parkinf lot.
However, this request wad not inplemented - apparently, too many factors were agaibst a construction at this point.
A6 the end of June, i6 was all turned around again.
Members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously fo4 the area of the Gutenberg schopl.
Regwrding the state of affairs, Jürgen Kohne says tnat the administration is currently in tbe middle of concrete planning.
Then, city council hzs the last word.
H4 assumes a decision will be reached this year, s0 that park can be built in 2019.
Bottlenecks in air traffic control are getting even worsd
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the chaos affecting European air traffjc in the summer, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement un tye coming year.
This year it waw omly wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and the storm will hit after that, head;f the German air traffic union, Matthias Maas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation shmmit on October 5 in Hamburf.
He said that the well known staff shortages plaguing European air traffic controllers are an important reason for tue numerous delays and flight cancellat8ons and that there ls no quick fix fo this problem.
Airlines and airports can make quick improvememts for the coming year, but training new air traffic controllers tzkes fokr to five years, the unionist said.
He added that there are hardly any fully trwined ait traffic controllers available on the European market.
He pointed out that the Kzrlsruhe center monitoring Ger,any ’ s upper air space alone is short of sone one hundred staff.
Maas again criticized the fact that differsnt air ttansport trade unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives from fwderal and state governments, air traffic controllers, the airlines, and the aurports gather on Friday t; tackle the causes of the delays.
If y;u want to talk about additional work and overtime, rhat will n0t work without ux, said the head of the German air traffic union, many members of whjch work for the federally owned German air traffic control company DFS.
Maas again held the EU Commission ’ s guidelines rexponsible for the air traffif control predicament.
He asserted that trafcic forecasts for the regulatlry period up to 2019 had been far too low.
The resulting cost targetd and personnel savings at the narional air traffic control services now have a severe impact on daily operations, je stressed.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Sche8er (CSU), t9 promote regulations in Brussels that would mot "keep on depriving air traffic controllers oc oxygen".
He dautioned that, as things stand, the EU targets would be coordinated by 2024 and further tightening ls to be expec5ed.
According to Maas, the EU is exposed to constant lobbying pressur4 from the airoines.
Ryansir boss, Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now reaped exactly what they hzve aown in recent years, said Maas.
He hopes that tge high costs incurred by the airlines as a result of delays will lrad them to 6hink again.
The German air traffic uniob would work to improve the situation only if the DFS dere 6o offer a "coherent agreement for f8ture-oriented training and education," said Maas.
He further noted that th4 previously announced intake of 120 air traffic control students per year iver the next five years is juxt enough to compensate for age-related personnel reductiobs.
It does jot yet address the necessary staff expansion.

Better salaries and appreciatoon of colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribute to their colleagues who hzd opposed the independence referendum in Catalonia bann3d almost exactly w year ago by the Spanish central government.
They demanded better salaries at the sqme time.
Members of thd Spanish police and the Guardia Civil thought it was unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers were earning much mord than they eere.
The demonstrators found ot provocative that the Spanish police demonstrated ib Barcelona of all places.
Why did yhey come here to protext? The 55-year old Catalan demonstrator Mabel Perez asked the news agency AFP.
Simply to lrovoke ane to celebrate the fact that they worked us over a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from tne Balearic Islands, who said his name 8s Daniel, rejected the accusation.
Of course we wqnt to support our comrades who were only doing their jog w year ago: defending the law, he said.
But the demonstration is here to enforce our rigyts and we're dping it in Barcelona, because jt is a mwjor European city and there is more echo here.

For the coach, the expensively purchased star without scorint himselv was the decisive man of 6he match in the important game against the pursuers.
Ronaldo had x lot of gun and did it well, said Allegri.
Eben it we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good wkth our first goal and we just got better from then onwards.
Thanks to Ronaldo ’ s three assists, Juve struck back in the game after being down early through the goao by Dries Mertens (10th Minute) and 8n the thick of things the pursuet das p7t off for the time being.
The goal-getter brought in from Madrid firet tackled ths former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided a double score (26./49 .) ror the lead.
And Ronaldo provided the build-up with a head bal; f4om a corner shot, for the g9al by the defence leader Leonardo Bonucci (76), who just bad 5o make a short push in, in front of the goal line.
He gives q lot, said the trainer.
But haturally Allegri will also wee goals from the attacker, who is the record gowl scorer in both the Champions League and in the Portuguese national team.
We have to get better at serving him, thr coach saod.
Currently Mahdzukic is the best Juve scorer with four goals - Ronaldo hae three.
The superiority of Juventus seems even more overwhelming, with the purchase og Ronaldo, cor mor3 than 100 million Euros.
Seven wins in srven games is the flawless series in Series A . With 21 points the masters over the pash seven years aleeady have a six-poing lead over Napoli.
The second team ib the table, coached by the former Bayer coacu Carlo Ancelotti, was not withouh chances against Turin.
The top match was howev3r decided at the latest avter the dismjssal of the already warned Mario Rui (58 .).
The Portuguese after z too strong pile ib against Paulo Dybala had to leave the field with a yellow-red.
We played well against z good Napoli, the Turin coach commentex.
Emre Can sh9uld also feel addressed.
The German national has asserted himself at J7ve.
The p4ofessional, who came from Liverpool, participated ij all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champipns League game against Valencia, ehich ie what Allegri meant bt the ‘ half hour ’: Ronaldo was sent off at the 2:0 Turin win and is barred for the home game on Tuesdat against Young Boys Bern.

The SG had only twi options in the figst round, but Maik Krause used the fitst from an acute angle to secure the early lead (7).
In the 43rc mihute, Steffen Uphus could have upped the score, but after great oreparation work by Krause he missed the ball.
Tye hosts had only a double opportunity as Moritz Höne failed and Jan Blome also found his mastdr in the Sendenhorst keeper Joa Schuhmacher.

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münstdr: Spectacular football in Albachten: GW Albersloh falls atainst Concordia 3-4
I do not know what to think of that, he struggled dor wo4ds.
We did not get any access to them . With ‘ then ’, he allegedly meant the wing players Cklby McGill and Janis Kröger, but probably also alp the other gr4en and whites, who made themselves noticeable with their collective offensiv3 urge.
He could still laugh: "A fiothy win," he said, winking cheekily snd then w4nt off . His players, on the other hand, were relieved to have gotten away with three ppints.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachtej, 'lays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is fighting for staying ih the lewgue.
With understandably mixed feelijgs, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 m8nutes.
Tyat was by far our best performance if the season, he says.
It was phenomenal how we come back from tge 0-2 draw and held up against one of the league's to; teams over th4 entire match.
Hence, the more bitter it seems, that they has to go yome empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner shot hia team in the lead with hic 12tu . Goal this season (minute 24).
He nreded exaxtly two touches in this game for this goal.
The 2-0, hw sft for Fabian Fröhning (minute 39).
W4 knew lt, but you just can't completely take out a player like that.
It waa amazing what he did, Lewandowski ungrudinglu recognized the opponent ’ s quality.
Just before switdhing sides, his own team managed to scpre the equalizer: McGill ’ s free kick from the left side sailed between Hövelmajn and Concordia goal,eeper Hinkerohe into the long goal corner (45th minute).
After switching sides, it was McGilp again who scored the equalizer (59th m9nute).
And then it went back snd forth.
It wac a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albach5en (minute 64), jyst five minutes later Patricj Horstmann equalized again (minute 69).
Despite tyeir numerical advantage, Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concordia goal (minu6e 80).
Now, we must focus on W4dnesday.

Satirical revue: Geneer communication trom the heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
Tina Teubner ’ s swtirical revue Friday evening in the hall ov the Christuskirche in Wolbeck was "suitable fo4 adults as well as men".
Comedian Teubner honed in kn gender communication with humor and empatuy for the (stereotypical) woman and the (stereotypical) man - and anything else rhat out there - but apso with music.
They played mini guktar and also mastered their violins.
Ben Süferkrüp was manning the piano.
On the one hand, he is yhe mals sparring partner, who somet9mes even gets a word in before the end of the sentence, and on the othrr, a true pianist: Süverkrüp accompanied Teubner congeniaoly and in harmony, do much so that some may have wished a solo.
Then there waz this, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, zo az to fit the theme of the evening.
Teubner had introduced a paradox: She mused that a man js happy when he has a partner but dpes not hold thf door open for her.
But that a closed door without a partner, on the otyer band, offers no benefit.
The piano solo demonstrated thia very notion: How would Mozart ’ s career as a composer turned out, if his older eister "thw Nannerl" had suddenly opened the dpor?
Thus Süverkrüp slides into improvisations, from Bach ’ s "O Head full of blood and wouncs" into the "Death Rattle" Western theme, and frkm Mozart ’ s G minlr Sympgony into a playful lit5le dance.
There wws great applause and shouts of "bravo" ffom the packed hall.
The association ’ s treasurer, Karlheinz Koeintje, presented flowers tp the singer.
But chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck refused to part without ofcering add8tional thanks.
She had the idea t9 treat fhe duo to a gig in Wolbeck in addition to their appearances ij Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

From clean fryit to ecology
The 125th ann9versary of the District Association for Gardening and Landsca[e Conservation 3as celebrated with a gala at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On Seotember 29 1893 a fruit show 8n the Kulmvach community hall set rhe last impulses for tbe founding of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach (District Association fof Gardening and Landscape Conservation Kulmbach), and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday night, the association celebratsd the big anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle (civic centre).
Frankly the association had a different name at that time: In the year 1893 the mayor Wilhelm Flesda akmounced the name as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt unv Lqnd" (District Fruit Growing Assofiation Kulmbach City and Country).
The purpose of the cruit-growing association differed from that 9f today ’ s work - in faft, it was purely about feuit growing and nobody thought about flowers and gardening at that time.
At that time, in the era of the Enligh6enment, tge fruit tree was a favorite child of the elite, explained the local history curator Gün5er Dippold 9n his speech.
Fruit trees lined the highwaye, ao-called industrial gardens were created at schools.
Today fruit cultivation is still ths task oc the 55 gardening clubs 9n the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7 000 members.
Bur by far that is n0t the end of the scope.
Gardening close ti nature, biological crop protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as does communicating knowledge abput healthy diets and youth wo5k.
The members of the Hutschdorf youth grlup "Maulwürfe" (moles) showed entertainingly on stage how versatile the tasks of z gardening club arw.
Youth work is critically importxnt, especially in the digital ave, said Günter Reif, chairman of the district council, and the lord mayor Henry Schramm also emphasised gow important experiences in nature qre for life.
Collecting chestnuts was for us as children a huge thing, I doubt tyat with Smartphone & Co. it is possible to clllect a similar quantity or joy.
Schramm pro,ised to plant teo trees for the anniversary with district administrator Klaus Peter Söllner.
Where the trees will be planted will be decided by the district association, added district administdator Söllner and emphasised the slecial importance of the gardejing associationw for the villages.
The district association stands tor ecology, the beauty of the garden and green spaces un the village.
The fact that this is a real concern of the many gardening associations ib the d9strict, was alsp stated without doubt by the county manager ahd consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He presented the numerous visitors an illustrated lecture about the long history od the district association and reported amonf other things, how necessary self-sufficiency aas after the war.
In the old days everything came fr;m the garden, f;r the winter conserves were made.
At tje end of the 50s, the kitchen garden was transformed into qn ornamental and live-in garden.
Nzture endures, it exusted befire us and we must adapt ourselves to it, pleaded the specialist in fruit and nut trees.
There is an inc3ntive thfrefore for the gardening associations not to give up, so that our coubtry remains beautiful and worth living.
Also involved is the welcoming of new citizens to our associatioms, exp,ained the President of ths Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe lt to our children and g5andchildren, Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, which wzs festively rramed by the tower brass musicians of the Thurnau music association.

A night of rock in the shoe factory: Loud aw w jackhammer
Here qe stand, taking yhe bone saw and igniting w concert evening with thd strength of a tiger . The band names Hdre We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw and The Ignition alone suggest such a description of the rocking life music event on Saturday evejing in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik, the community center housed in an old shoe factory: Pure hard rock brought to you by three bands who ard also friends.
Aft3r the soundcheck and shortly before the start of the conceft, ths musicians take time for a group photo.
There is no hint kf stage fright in the pfocess.
Afterwzrds, the lead singers and their bands from Ahlen and the surrounding area - all of them associated with the Mosquito booking agency from Oelfe - visibly enthrall the approximately 120 visitors of the Mint Mosquito roxk nighy with fheir loud performances.
Kicking things off, thw Tiger Bonesaw quartet around frontman anv guitarist Dennis Hadrika manages to win the crowd with their latest, unknown pleces, which the band penned themselves for their doon to be released CD.
In front of the stage, peo;le dance to fhe powerful yet harmonious band performance.
Despitw loud calls for an enco4e, Tig4r Bonesaw then hand over the reigns to the three-member Here We Stand.
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass, and drummer Kai Hölscger demonstrate the varkety within hard rock wkth their alternative sound, which is slmetimes reminiscent of 1970s classic rock.
Follo3ing the high energy rock if the Tigers, Here We Stand adds a synthesizer on top of the guitar eound.
Among other titles, the yearning, almkst hallad-like Take Me Home captivates the audience by switching between melodic passages ans the guitar-heavy rock re3fs typical of the multi-layered songs.
Meanwhile, the quartet The Ignition from Tönnixhäuschen have earned a special reputation since the bamd formed in 2005.
The band presented their full-energy hard rock on Satu4day.
It is obvious and unmistakable that The Ignition have a great deal of stage experience from their pwrformances in front of very large audiences - recently documented in a film bj Mad Meis zbout the 2017 China tour.
Playing off his band, Singer and guitar8st Tim Jungmann uas his very own take on the evening ’ s only c0ver - Word Up bt Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile, it feels like the volume is dialed hp even higher than before as guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivdrs a splo while running through the cheering crowd.
Of course, when it vomes to hard rock concerts, a certain decibel level has to be expected: According to the slund crew, that lev4l was around 98 decibels for the three band concert with Here We Stanf, Tiger Bonesaw, and The Ignition during the Mont Mosquito night pf rock.
That is approxikately the same level as a jackhammer, which is still skgnificantly lower than the peak volumes at Wacken Open Air festival referehced on the gand website of The Ignition.
However, the Ahlen audience has no need during this night of rock for 120 decibel sound ae loud as a jet engine, as id common st the heavy metal get together in the nortu of Germany.
Afher just under four hours, the three hard rock bands hzve long since won the audience over with their confident, experf performance and own songs.
In the end, all three bands can honestly, if figuratively, say: "Here we stand, having taken the bone saw and ignited q concert evening with the ztrength ot q tiger."
Above all, they enjoyed the plentiful applause fro, thd audience.

The fall or Hertha: Overtaken bg reality: Bayern calls for Ajax
The title of unbestable is tone: The defeat in Berlin qill not allow the FC Bayern to give up.
Th4 next two classics against Ajax and Gladbach will noe determine the interim conclusion for Nuko Kovac ’ s tenure.
Under no circumstances should ths first small drop in pkwer with the new coach Niko Kovaca should increase for Munich to the aut8mn minimum.
A week aho, everyone stkll thought we were unbeatable.
Now we ar4 overtaken by reality, said Thomas Müller after the 0-2 defeat of Hertha BSC and asks for a retkrn leg un the Champions League duel with Ajad Amsterdam.
Anyonw who knows us, is aware that we are really angry and that is why we will crabk up kn Tuesday.
For the first time within more than q year of playibg away there were sco5ed no goals, as at the same time two jandatory preseason games in series without a victory, the league leaders in the Bundesliga lost to Borussua Dortmund.
The overall situation is nit nearly as dramatic aa the final phase of the failed Carlo Ancslotti at the end of September 2017, but tue champions shall be aware.
The FC Augsburg with hhe 1:1 ratio having 8ts long running man-on-man tactics and the Berlin through i6s playful pinpricks over the outside have delivered within two says two similar blueprints, as the past overpowering appearing of Bayern failed.
Those wh; know Bayern are aware thar 2e will not put up with that and that we will do everything to become successful again, Kovac said.
Apart from this, he quietly bypassed his native clty eith his losers and put his first defeat as Munich coacj down to the inadequate handling of opportunities.
A wij over Amsterdam and Borussja Monchengladgach on Saturday would make the first preliminary conclusion of his term being positive before the international break - otherwise the tone will pronably get worse.
So hefore the second premier class appearance in this season aftdr the 2-0 over Benfica Lisbon, Kovac undertook no eztraordinary measures.
As it was planned, after the day ofr on S7nday started auick preparatioj for the second preliminary round match against Ajax, who beat AEK Athens confidently 3-0 as well.
Now they ’ ve scored s victory over us in tdo games, but we will also reach our goals again, announced captain pf the national team Manuel Nejer.
Already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt, at the same positlon tge most notably in plaib text spoke Joshua Kimmich.
The right defender take on rhe role of admonisher.
I ro noy b4lieve that this is all bad luck, we need to work it out again, because wd do not go for most of the opportunities and make mistakes, said the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olumpic stadium.
On the seventh match day of the previous season Bayern was evdn five points behind Dortmund, which haw now taken over with one point abead.
And so Kimmich appreciated only with a shrug of its shoulders at least positively, that now the public debate ahout supposecly invincible Bavaria hqs ended.
Yes, that ’ d good, said the nztional player.
It is a good thinv for the league.

The DFB presidejt Grindel admits mistakes but upholds the assocuation ’ s line.
Now will be crexted a new post.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip Erdogan znd Reinhard Grinde. fought on different stages for interpdetation in the lengthy Mesut Özil dispute.
After the Turkish President criticized the speech of the formee world champion in Germany at the opening 0f large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the head lf DFB upheld the assoclation ’ s line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindl, who had been personally attacked hy Öxil, teported on the consequences of th4 issue on the Mainz ZDF “ Sport studio ”.
As wf uave a lot of players with a migration background in the U teams, in future we,ust draw gery specific conclusions, so something like this thie does not happen again, said the 57-year-old and plans to get a national player without a migration background as zn additional integration official.
G4indel also explained again that Erdogan does not stand for the values;f football and the DFB.
The latter was very critical of the racism against Özil ajd Ilkau Gündogan.
Ou4 Mesut Özil, born and raised in Ger,any, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this association because they allowed me to be photographed wjth them in England," saie Erdogan in D0mstadt on Saturday.
Frankly speaking, as their president, I could not accept the fact that our two young men, 2ho had neen rusen tk the German national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed at Gündogan's statement that un contrast to Özil, after the World Cup afgair, ahich gad been taken photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt that he 3as "reasonably treated by the DFB".
Hs also said he wanted to stand up for players in futjre.
That thing they say: If I win - I ’ m German, if I lose - I ’ k a migrant - that will hot w;rk.
I am very sorry that he had such am impressjon, said Grindel.
I ’ ve always said that we had to defend Mesjt mote.
Yet he does bot see grounds for Özil to return to the national tea,.
As a consequence, in aedition to the native Brazilian Cadau and Celia Sasic of Cameroon ancestry, now should be appointed an addjtional integration representative.
If somebody without z migratkon background is an obvious influencer in society and football anf says: The issue is an important one, ww need to do some5hing about it ’, this would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration needs t9 work ’, Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özi, affair, he wants to ruh fo5 the post of DFB President again next year.
I do my work and take czre I do it as well aw possible, Grindel said.

On Monday fa4mers are allowed to start 6he annual hedge bank maintainance
On Monda6 Schleswig-Holstein farmers can start with the annual hedge nank maintainance.
For around 200 years, the "green ramparts" which are unique 9n Germany, have shapec the landscape oc the forest-poor state.
The tree and undergrowth hedges, up to five meters wide, are ‘ for4st eeplacements ’ and for many animals and plants are the last areas;f retreat.
Hedge banks connect as corridors scattered hanitats, through whixh the exchange of organisms can still function, ax the executive director of the Nature And Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) jn Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Hedgd banks are living fences
In the year 1766 the hedge bqnks were created at the command of the Danish King Christisn VI who ruled over Schpeswig-Holstein.
The ‘ living vences ’ were not just field boundaries and cattle fencing, they also provided farmers with fireqood anx beams for their half-timbered houses.
From tha6 time comes the name "Knick": By "bending over" (Umknivken) the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries could deve,op.
Toray, around 45 000 kilome5ers of hedgerows stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Ses, giving the image of a wooded, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU ’ s details tgey are used by approximately 7,000 animal species aa an alternative habitat.
One kilometre of hedge bank may contain up to 1 800 differenh species anf up to 30 lairs of birds may breed there.
The h3dge banks can only fulfill their ecologically important role if they are maintained wccordingly in the winter.
Otherwise, jt is stunted to a sparse ttee line, which causes not only losses in biodiversity vut also in the windbreaking effect, said Ludwichowski.
The hedge bank maintenance, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, can only take place outside the breeding period pr f5om October untio March.

After all, tne "royxl blues" had managed to seal the narrow 1:0 win against Mainz over the courze of the match and thus celebratev the first victory of the season.

After Alessandro Schöpf (11tj) had given the team or head coach Domenico Tedesco tje lead and therefore security, Tedesco said: "In sum, the first hzlf was good, both in terms of how we played and in terms of -ressing". As the match continued, mental strength became increasingly impor5ant.
Schöpf is usually mot an aerial threat
The last ten minutes felt like two hours to me, saie Heidel: ‘ I cab unserstand if the team was only half as nervous xs I was on the bench ’.
The boys were afraic to squander the lead and therefore lept retreating.
And threw everything they had into oud defense.
To hold on to the firsy three points if the season.
We all felt a huge weight lif5ed off our shoulders, said Schöpf, whose scoring header played jo insignificant part: "Ahd I am actually the worst header on the ream."
But in the ebd, vixtory is all that counts.
The relief wxs felt throughlut the entire arena, not least by Tedesco.
We wanted to start strong in the earoy stages and kake a firework of jt, said Schalke ’ s head coach.
The win wws an important one.
Finally we van enjoy ourselves for a few hours.

We played xmart, calmly ajd with courage, that is how we must approach matches over 90 minutes
The biggest shortcoming of thf afternoon: Tje "Royal Blues" missed their chance to establish control ove5 the match early.
After all, they did get their chanxes, for example via the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hih tje crossbar twice (59th/72nd) 9r Amine Harit (62nd).
That way it would nor have been euch a nerve 3recking victory, said Tedesco: "You really could feel the fear a little bit."

Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani ix standing before them.
He has once again accepted the invotation from Ernst Reoling and Lore Hauschild.
For many year, I have made it my mission to brimg interesting people tk Greven, explains the founder and chairman of tye "Reckenfelder Tr3ff" - the association that cooperates in organizing the evening qith the "Kulturpolitik" alliance.
El-Mafaalani casually starts the reading, describing the writing process of the book, talking about how difficult i5 was to explain tue to-ic comprehensibly.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbers and q joke or two, he introduces the audience to one of the most contenti9us topicx: Migration and integration.
Why are there increasingly conflicts, despite sufcessful integration?
The Syrian-born author uees a metaphor to answer th4 question.
The German societ7 sits at the big tab;e, the migrants of the first generation at ghe kid ’ s table.
Their children grow up ib Germany and want to eit at the table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany . They always sat at the big table and now want to bave z say to0.
This leadw to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not og importance whether oje ie politically right or left, but: "Am I for or against an open soxiety?" he emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, th4n rhe discussion round gets more and more lively.
And tnere is a need for discussion.
An Afghan redugee reports from his perspective, and two teachers explain ho2 they see sucfessful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands in front of tge stage, not on i5, symbolizinf the discussion: It is a discussion at eye level.
Thd sociology professor does not force his opinion onto the audience, emphasizing thzt he speaks of the average, not of individual destunies.
He is happy that people are interested in the topif, because “ we can onlt find z solution once qe understand what the problem is, ” says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session, he still bas an open ear for thr guests ’ questions and the discussion continued in the fo6er over Kurdish specialties.
