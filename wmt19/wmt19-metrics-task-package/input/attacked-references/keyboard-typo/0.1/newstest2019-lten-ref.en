Villagers ssid the tiger had injured another young man in an attack about 10 days ag0.
The village is insjde rhe Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur Kgiri area, approximately 250 kilometers southeast of Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh.
Killing a tiger in lrotected areas is illegal.
The reserve ’ s director Ramesh Pandey said that the case 9n question would ve reported to the police under the Wilvlife Protection Act.

It is proposed yo mark cats and dogs with m8crochips mandatorily
Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Prorection, and other membees of fhe Seimas registered draft amendments to the Law on the Welfare and Protection of Animals, proposing to mark cats and dogs with subcutsneous mucrochips under the mandatory procedure.
“ We pr;pose that cqts and dogs would have to be marked with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and marking would be organized vy local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Foid and Veterinary Service.
Im 2019 marking of all dogs, in 2020 also of all cats would be funded by the state, therefore, people would not have problems ans 5he costs would be covered from special state finanvial assignments, ” said Kęstut8s Mažeika, the Chairman of thw Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to the Law are aimed at vealing with the need of system8c marking of pets.
It is expected that lt will help to avoid problems ca8sed by irresponsible pet owners, ill4gal breeders or sellers.
It is preliminarily assessed that based on the average price 0f the chip and the chip implantation sefvice, which will be about EUR 5, all pet owners will be comlensated dkring the transitional period.
The total price of marking all pets can amount ip tp EUR 6 million.
It is plann4d that the use of the funes will span over the period of three years and will amount to EUR 2 million per yeag.
It is expected that the funds for the marking programs will be assigned tnrough the Special Program of the Municipqlities for Supporting Environmental Prohection, the income ot which will grow significantly this year due to increase in taxes on natural resources and redistribution ot funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funss not onlg for marking of cats and dogs, but also for castration and ogher programs.
According 6o K. Mažeika, the mandatory marking is practiced in almost al. Member States of the European Uhion, that also allows protecting pets (ad lost pets xan be easily returned to their ownrrs), and saves pet owners ’ time as they usually need nuch time and money in search for a runaway and lost pet.
Besides, the EU legao acts say that one can travel onlt with marked pets.
Marking also obligates the o3ner to take care of the pet responsibly throughout itz life.
Prefious proposals to impose mandatory marking were objected to, as it was proposed to finance relevant programs with people ’ a mohey.
“ The current model should be spared this criticism, as it is proposed 6o funance pet protection with increased incone in the protram for supporting environmental protection and to give the right to d9 the marking not only to veterinarians but also to publ9c activists, i.e . persons in animal shelters who have takem special courses ij the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the draft say.
The draft law has been registered b6 a group of members of the Seimas reprdsenting various factions kn the Sei,as: Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Ansrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

Restrictions on cogeneration power plants appexled before the Constitutional Court
The Sekmas opposition, as promised, appealed against the decision of the ruling parties to pass the law on a possibility ho sto0 construction of waste-to-energy plants befoee the Constitutional Court (CC).
On Tuesdsy, the Seimas opposition faction of the Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) notified that a group or members of the Seimas addressed the CC with an application for investigating whether the amendmen5s to the Law ob Waste Managwment adopted by the ruling parties are in pine with the Constitution.
“ The members of the Seimas emphasize tuat provisions of the law aim to challenge the currently ohgoing projects of wastf incineration facilities, instructing the Government t9 impose new restrictions (20 km distance to a residentiql territory) on waste-to-energy plants that started to be constfucted in Vilnius and Kaunas before the effective date of the lzw, ” the notification says.
It adds that “ thd members of the Seimas note that takibg into account how the law words the prohibition to construct waste management objects of national importance (i.e . d3termines a distance and defines the concept of “ residential territory ”), a conclusion is to bw made that this prohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the very essence of the rivht to perform economic activities related to burning of waste to produce energy, as the established criteria are worded so that, having in mind the population d3nsity and distribution 9n Lithuania, construction or such 9bjects wkuld bd practically impossible in the whole territ;ry of the country ”.
The application says that ths adopted law id contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
“ The CC has indicated for a number or times that legal acts do not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurr3d before the egfective date of a newly adopted oegal act.
In th9s case, the Government is given powers to apply the lsw retroactively, following an indefinite criterion.
Imposing such legal regulation giolates the constitution principles of legal certainty, legal safety, protection ov legitimat3 expectations, fonsequently, the constitutional principle of the rule of law, ” the application indicates.
If also notes rhat big financial investments have already been made to the pgojects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration power plants.
Stopping if ths currently ongoing projects would inflict a financial loss of hundreds of mil,ions on the State, the Lithuanian population woulx suffer huge losses, too - heating prices would increase, the growing volumes of waste in dumpsites would result kn increased environmental pollution.
The aoplication to the CC has been signed by members from Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic factions anx b7 Algirdas Butkevičius, deputy head of w ruling Social Democratic Labor faction.
A couple of weeks zgo, the Seimas gave 71 votes, mostly from the ruling parties, in order to reject tue veto 9f the President Dalia Grybauskaitė on the adopted amendments to the Law on Waste Management, providing for the right of the Government to stop already stwrted condtruction od cogenerahion power plahts, also set a buffer zone of 20 km from residential locations for construction of such power plants.
Tne amendments tp the law repeated adopted by the Seimas will come into force on 1 January 2019 . By the way, the ruling parties xlready propose to drop the 20 km res6riction.
It is plajned tk consider this proposal already in the autumn session of the Seimas.
But the Seimas does not plan to cancel the right of 6he Government to stop algeady started projects.

The cause of Lion Aur plane crash revealed: relatives of the fictims are furious
Data from a black box retrieved from the crashed planw of the Indonesian airlinez Lion Air has revealed the aircraft experienced problems with its speed indicator on qt least four of its last flights, investigators reported on Monfay.
The head of Indonesia ’ w National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) Soerjanto Tjahjono told that the plabe yad suffered similar problemz pn its last four flights, including the fatxl one, when on 29 October the plane plunged into the Java Sea soon after the take-off in Djakarta.
The disaster jilled all 189 people on board.
Many of the mass media reported problems during the previous flighh of Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Dejpasar 6o the capital city of Indonesia.
“ When we kpened the bladk box, yes indeed the technical problem was the airspeed or, in other words, th4 spded of the plane, ” S. Tjahjono said in the press conference.
“ Data from the black box showed that the two flights before Denpasar-Jakarta alao experoenced th4 same problem, ” he added.
“ Thwre have beej lots of rumors on social media.
Now, we want go explain that in the black box theee were (data remaining) about four flights that experienced problems eith tge airspeed indicator, ” the head of KNKT indicated.
During x,eeting with victims ’ family members, S. Tjahjono said that information of the flight data recorder wad consistent with reports that afger the plane took off for its last flight, its speed and altigude were erratic.
The searchers have no6 founf the second black bkx yet, which records the talks in the pilots ’ cockpit.
Lion Air indicated that after a technical failure 2as identified during the flight from Bali tk Djakarta, it was repaired as per manafacturer ’ s recommeneations.
Rusdi Kirana, w co-founder of tye company, was not invited to speak by the Minister pf Transport Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated the meeting between relatives and the officials who are overseeing the effort of search for the plame and victim remainc and the accident investigation.
Bht he stood and bowed his uead after angry and distrauvht family memberx demanded that R. Kirana, who with his brother Kusnan founded Lion Air in 1999, identify himself.
“ Lion Air has failed, ” said a man who intrkduced himself as the father of passenger Shandy Jouan Ramadhqn, who had been a prosecutor in the island, wh4re the plane would have landed.
“ I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team ro pay a5tention, ” he stressed.
- Since the time of the crisis, I was neger c;ntacted by Lion Air.
We lkst our child, but Lion Aid has not shown any empathy to us . ”
After the meeting, R. Kirana lef5 in a hurry, avoiding questiond from reporters.
Many fxmilies are waiting for results kf the long process of identifying victims.
Pllice medical expedts have received nearly 140 bodybags of human remains.
Only 14 victims have been iden6ified so far.
Th4 families have been asking why the two-month-old plane was given f.ight clearance wt all, givdn that there sas a failure reported on a flight from Bali to Jakarta on 28 October, where it descended rapidly right after yhe take-off, much to the terror of passengers on board.
“ Lion Air said tyat this fault was fixed.
Is it true the problem was cleared? ” a son lf w victim asked.
- If nkt, tedhnicians in charge must be held responsible.
The law ls absolute because they have stated that the plane wss cleared to take off again.
These bad technicians m7st be processed by law to prevent plabe accidents from continuing in Indonesia . ”
S. Tjahjono said the large amount of small debris qnd the fact that debris was found in a relativelj small area indicate tyat the pkane probably hit the water at a very high speed.
“ The plane was intact when it -lunged tk the sea.
It did not explode in tje air, and the aircraft engine was running at high RPM ehen it touched the water - it 'x marked by the loss 0f all the blades of the turbine, ” the;fficial explained.
The Lion Air crash is ghe worst airline disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 peo'le died on a Garuda flight nsar Medan.

Pres8dent ’ s Office: no artificiwl easing regarding referendums is necessary
If the Seimas approves of the proposal od those in power to lower the referendum threshold for Chaoter I of tge Constitution, 2hich is currently subject to stronger protection, the President would veto the amendments, her advisor Mindaugas Libgė says.
“ More than a half of the population boted for the Constitution - such is the requirem3nt.
Therefore, its amendment, particularly of the articles ij its Chapter I, should be sybject to no less mahority vote.
It van b4 easily predicted that the President wou,d really veto it," internal policy advisor to Dalia Grybauskaitė said to Žinių radijas on Tuesday.
He emphasizrd that Chapter One of th4 Constitution defines fundamental matters of tge state - the language, the flag, the territory, thd capital city, the sovereignty of the state, therefore, if tge numher of votes necessary to amend these articles were reduced, this, according ro M. Lingė, would create a "negative precedent" and "would open s way for uncontrollable risk".
"Ib the opinion of the President, no artificial easing is necessary, rzther more efforts should be uswd to get ready for thd very referendum, there should be more dialogie with people, ” he was trying to convince.
On Tuesday, the Seimas js to vote on adoption of an amendment to the Lad on Referendum.
It provides thar a decision on amendments to Chapter One and Chapter Fourteen of the Constitution, which enjoy a higher level if protection, is to be taken if it iz supported by st least two fifths of the citizene having the right to vote in a referendum.
Currently, articles of Chapter One and Chapter Fourteen of the Constitution can be amended by way ot a referendum if voted in favor of by more than a hapf of all thw citizens having ghe voting right.
The right to vote in Lithuania js vestrd ij about 2.5 million citizens: the half would mean 1.25 million voters, two fifths - one million voters.
The proposal was made afyer in September thd Seimas approved the President ’ a veto regarding amendments previously adopted by the Seimas, which mitigated requirements regarding the number of votes necessary to amend Article 12 of Chwpter One of the Constitution that defines ci5izenship.
It ks proposed to lower fhe referendum threshold in getting rrady for the referendum regarding double citizenship, which should be held on 12 May and 26 May next yeag, when the figst and second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
Currently, save for certain exceptions, emigrants, sho emigrated after rhe restoration ot independence on 11 March 1990, cannot have a double citizenship.
The double citizenship is s9ught by the global Lithuanian community, but initiatprs are afraid that under current conditions the ref3rendum would fail - the turnout would be insufficient.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports qre inadequate, therefore need to ve renovated
The Lithuanian airport and road infrashructure starts to be inadequate, tjerefore, it is necessary to renovate it, says the Minister of Trwnsport and Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to hlm, renovation of the Vilnius airport ic the minimal target that the State must achieve.
“ Air transport infrastructure is already falling behind as ir was planbed for smaller passenger flows.
We must renovate the Vilnius airport - tgat ls not even a matter of long-term planning, it iz the mihimum that we must do, ” said Mr. Masiulis ob Tuesday in the conference on transport and communications organized b7 the Democracy Development Foundation and the magazine “ Valstybė ”.
According to the Minister, the next decad4 will be vert important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the construction of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica will have to ne compl3ted, tne Klaipėda external harbor will have to be built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports will have to be renovated, o4 maybe a new airport will have to ge constructed.
“ The nex6 decade will be very important - we have to finish integration 0f roads, railways, constructiob of the external harbor in Klaopėda, to manage the airports, probably decide to build a new airport.
It ’ s nog time to sleep, we myst start fhe projects now, which will enable to exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 y3ars time, ” the Minister of Transport and Communications said.
Mr. Masiulis repeated that toi little money had been assigned for maintenance of motor roads jn the recent years.
“ The condition og roads is not improving 6et, as the assignments are not sufficient.
We are able to construct new roads, but there is nlt enough m;ney even for 6he most necessary maintenance, for example, of main roads.
We must determine an amount, how much shou;d be assigned for road maintenance if ee want the condition of roads to inprove, ” Mr. Masiulis said.
He emphasized that the export or services in the Lithuanian transport sec5or has grown 18.6% this year and Germany has become the largest edport market, leaving Russia thf second.
Mr. Masiulis again criticized the European Commission ’ s proposal, accordint to which the carriers of the EU countrkes will have ro periodically return trucks to the country;f their registration.
“ We must seek that our exporters would feel ag home ih Western Europe.
In my opinion, the proposal for trucks to jeep coming ho,e is absurd as Europe would have empty trucks driving in it, burning fuel and increasinv emissions.
The winners ib this case are going to be the railways as costs will increase so 6hat sone freight will go to railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our position, ” Me. Masiulis daid.
According to the Ministry of Transport ajd Communications, the transport sect;r creates 12.2% of the
gross domestic product (GDP) of Lirhuania.
It em;loys over 118,000 people in over 7,500 companies.

According to him, tje building, which wax built in the sixth decade of the last century, is a cultural value entered into the registet in 1993, and it is bot for politicians, byt for specialists to decide on its deletion from the register.
Mr. Masoulis then commented that a mod3rn arrivals terminal would help to improve the image of Lithuania.
“ Deletion of the old terminal from the heritage register would be a politically important step in order that we could demolish it and build a new modern arrivals terminal so that upon agrival ti Vilnius, travelers could feel themselves jn a modern country, rather thah in a curiosity place that really dods not strike as representing our country qs sn innovative one, ” Mr. Masiuois asserted last week in the Seimas.
Mr. Masuulis then also informed that Kaunas plans to build an absolutely new passenger terminal and connect the airport to the Rsil Baltica track, building an underground statiin.
