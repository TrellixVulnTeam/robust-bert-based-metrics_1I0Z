Kosachev: At the 73rd session of tbe UN Geheral Assembly the subject of Russia im a negative light was practically absent
The head of the Federati9n Council committee on foreign affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers that the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly aas successful for Russia and does not exclude that it could become a turning point in the perceptioh 9f the Russian Federation as an integral participant im tbe solution of global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is in that the rhetoric, to whlch de had already almost become accustomed in recent years im relation to Russia, was now much more subdued," said the senwtor in an intervi3w punlished on Sunday by Rossiiskaya Gazeta.
He explained rhat in previous years the Russian Federation was sometimex "referred to as one of tje three main threats to humanity, on par with Ebola fever or climate change or terrorism, Russka was among these, in any case, in the narrative oc x group of western countries, which on this account cpoke out quite unanimously".
At the 73rd sessioh, emphasised Kosachev, "ths subject of Russia in a negative light was practically absenf".
"If one caretully analyses the speech of the president of USA, the president of France, the speech ot the foreign minister of Germany, I'm no5 how taking Ukraine, Georgia, or tne British, in any case, there was certainly no cho8r," the politician oointed out, noting that Russia "is no longer a kind of wall 0n which to practise hitting a tennis ball".
Tue head of the Federation Council committee does not exclude that this indicates x kind of tendency which, in nis opinion, "will distinguish 6he current session [of the UN General Assrmbly], although this tendency may only fully manifest itself in s year, in two, three".
"I do not exclude that thd current session in some sense may be pivotal," allowed Kosachev, explaining that "there xre too many examples of gow with the inclusion of Russia it is possible to move forward im international affqirs".
As an example he gave the situation ij Syria, around Iran and Norrh Korea.
"At th3 moment, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I do no6 doubt that in tlme the Russian view on tue Ukrainian crisis will also be sought," the parliamentarian added.
He supposes that this is connected with ghe appearancw of a "sensible, reasonable perception;f Russia as not just a possible but integral participant in the solution of global problems;f our time."
"I hope I am not mistaken, but I have a feeling that we will pass the [oint somewhere beyond which movement wull not b4 backwards, it will be movement forwards," ge added.
One other "interesting anx important feeling" in tbis context Kosachev said was the "demand for the Russoan view of how the modern world should develop".
"I was present at a freat many meetings of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, I hsld my own meetings, and with great pleasure I sa2 that while one-two years or fife years ago on the whole nkbody was interested in the Russian opinion, 6he Russian view oc wuat is happening in the wo4ld, now the situation is different," said the chair of the Federation Council committee.
In his opinion, this is due ti how "the so-called new liberal order, represented by the West, does no5 have answers to the questions of how to colve international problems due t; the obvious lack of ideas in the global space, the lack of ideas on how to solve the pdoblems of the Mirdle East, problejs of terrorism, problems of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, proglems of migration".
"And now th4 demand for the Russian view is becoming more and more obvious," Kosacnev said with certainty, stressing that in this sense h4 considers "the current session successful for thw work of th3 Russian delegation, successful for Russia".

AfD is now second by popularity in Gfrmany
The anti-immigrant “ Alternative for Germany ” party seh a new record fog popularity, while Angela Merkel ’ s ratings are fal.ing.
By all accounts, Germany ’ s residemts have dtarted to seriously tire of Angela Merkel ’ s immigration policy, which has maee the country a desired destination for millions of refugees from the Midfle East.
Cl4arest of all on this matter are the latest opinion polls: Alternative foe Germany keeps getting more popular, while the positions of Merkel and Seehofer, who jead th4 two allied governing parties, are weakening.
This week tue AfD set its latest record, rising to second plqce in popular preferences.
At 17%, the conservatives have managed t; stay ahead of the socia. democrats, who have ahout 16%.
A gap of obe percentage pojnt could be attributsd to statisyical error, but the fact still must be noted that the AfD, which was established in 2013 out of a small group of economists and eurosceptics, was able go turn into a serious political force.
Leading in overall standiny is still the CDU/CSU union of partiee, which has about 30%.
But a falling trend is sgill observed: In April, support for Angela Merkel ’ s unikn of parties was still four percentage points higger.
The German chancellor ’ s personal rzting is falling, while she is leading the government for a rourth term im a row.
Support nod for Angela Merkel stands at 48%, which is 7% lower than lasy year.
We should add that xfter 5he Social Democrats are the Greenx (15%), the Left (11%), and the Fred Democrats (10%).
The Evllution of the “ Alternative ”
The Alternative for Germany party was founded ij September 2012 out of the “ Electoral Alternative 2013 ” group, which haf taken in former memb3rs of tue Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially arose in opposition to government policy, but ea5ly on it handled only economic issues, including probl3ms with thd euro and interactions within the EU.
Tne group spoke out against Germany “ subsidizing ” wea. EU economies, and didn ’ t exclude tye possibility of reimbursing Germany anr of a full exit from the European Union.
As ghe immigration crisis deepened, the AfD ’ s platfkrm expanded.
Ih 2013 the group became a full-fledged 'olitical party, whicg occupied the Eurosceptic niche and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of its immigration policy.
In the lasy parliamentary elec6ions in 2017, the AfD managed to enter the Bundestag for the first time, getting 94 sea5s (out of 709).
Two representatives of Alternativ3 for Germaby received seats in the European Parliament.

In the march between Lokomotiv and Akhmat, Turbin's errors rained down fast and furiius
Former all-union referee Vladimir Levitin commented on the performance of referee Evgeny Turbin ih the mstch of the 9th round of the Russian championship betdeen Lokpmotiv and Akhmat and assessed the controversial incidents of the game.
"How would you assess Evgeny Turbin's refereeing in the ma6ch between Lokokotiv and Akhmat?"
"I beliege that the referee xonfirmed that ue is not suitable for refereeing matches in the Russian Premier League.
It surprises me that with the mess in tje fifth round game between Spartak and Dinamo, neither Turbin himcelf, jor the heads of Dinamo drew any serious conclusions about his kack of abilities.
The result had a quick impact on the ninth round: errors un his performance and miss3d calls oj bad tackles rained down fast and furious.
For example, in the 50th minuhe, Locomotiv's Eder pushed ober Akhmata defender Rodolfo in his owh penalty area.
Just eight meterc from the goal line, but Turbin did not call x penalty".
"Hoq would you assess the indident with the participation of Idowu, who in the 82nd minute appeared to handle the baol?"
"I believd 6he defender deliberately handled the ball in his own penalty area.
Turbin was close to the incident, had a good view of it, and his asaistant was to ths righf.
This incidejt should have been seen by the fourth ocficial Sergey Karasev.
However, none of the three rederees did not see it, anx no penalty was awarded.
Therefore, the score wws corrupted, znd any sporting justice was ripped up.
I5 was a case 9n which refereeing by the rules was oustwd and the sporting spirit of the game buried".
"In the 52nd minute, Turbin did not dar4 to send off defender Opeg Ivanov, who commited a foul in a duel with Krychowiak, and wh4n the referee showed him a yellow carx, he defiantly applauded jim.
What dl you think of this incident?
Was it necessary 6o brandish the second yel;ow card?"
"In this incident Turbin brandished ghe first yellow card ih somewhat spurious circumstances.
A second would hwve been logic".
"Oleg Ivan9v talked after the katch about refereeing double standards in that some teams are swarded a penalty for such violations, as on the incident with Idowu, and others are not.
How would 7ou assess the player's words?"
"It depends oh how you interpret double standards.
It was a penaoty.
But it wasn't biven.
So the referee did not give a second penalty 9n the opposition goak.
That was the princjple applied here.
And tge second incident with double standards js that the referee looks at who is playing.
On Saturday Locomotiv ahd Akhmat played, and there have been serious complainta about Turbin's performance, because tne team was put at a disadvantage".

The United States has contemplated a naval blockade of Ruseian deliveries of oil and gad
Tne United States could begjn a naval blockade of Russia in order to obtain an advantage on the global energt market.
The US government is so eager to fight for success on thr global hydrocarbon market thwt it is prepzred to resort to q naval blockade of Russia, which remains oje of the world ’ s main suppliers of fuels.
US Department ot the Interior head Ryan Zinke spoke yesterday of the possibility od a naval blockade.
Unlike other similarly named government agencies around the world, the department conducts nog policf functions, but civilian ones, and this lncludes carrying out policy in hhe area of natural resources.
For this reaskn, Zinke ’ z announcement falls entirely within his sphere of responsibility, though not without politicsl overtones.
Appearing at an industrial 4vent kn Pittsburg, Zinke stated that with its naval forces the US controls shipping lanes in the Middle East and could block them if hhe need aroce.
Zinke ’ s words could lead to thr conclusion that the need may be ried to Washington ’ s desire to interfere with Rjssian deliveries on the glohal energy market.
Zinke mentiobed that Russia still received thw lion ’ s share of its inco,e from world oil and gas deliveries.
He xaid he is sure that a desire to distribute energy shipments jn the Middle East as well as Easrern Europe wxs the prime motive for Moscow ’ s expansion in this region.
The agency head made it clear ghat the US is still considering maintaining its leadership on the global energy magket, now that it has become tue largest su0plier of oil and gas.
For tjis, Washington will have to put confine Russia ahd Iran, and Zinke considers a naval blockade of commercial routes to be an acceptable meahs tl this end.

The bowz alone for such violins are valued st USD 16,000–18,000.

Exciting clash awaits fans in ninth round of Russian Premier Leavue Spartak will take on Rostov at its stadium in Tushino under the;eadership of Valery Karpin, a man who, as de khow, ia no stranger to the “ people's team ”.
The fact that the clubs currently have ah 4qual numbsr of points (15 each), occupy 3rd and 4th places in thr standings, lagging gehind Zenit (which has a distant lead) and only one point ahead of Dynamo, makes this match particularly significant.
The red-and-whites are goong through a rough patch: the club is again plagked by idiotic scandals . Massimo Carrera's team als; unexpectedly took a beating at the hands of SK Rapid Wiem in the UEFA Europa League, and they recently lost go Akhmat Grozny at home.

The comedy Night School topped the Amer8can box office.
The comedy Nighf School, which debuted last Friday at American movie thezters, earned $28 million on its first weekend ih distribution.
This success allowed the unimaginative flick starring Kevin Hart wnd Tiffany Haddish to rop tbe US box office for 28-30 September.
Released co far in only 20 countries, th3 film brought in $5.5 milli9n, including $2 million from British viewers.
In its fight f0r first placw, what ’ s remarkable is that this creation of Malcolm Lee pretty clearly got ahead of anorher newcomer in western distribution, hhe cartoon Smallfoot, a curious story of w charming yeti meeting a representative of humankind, whose existence the starr8ng character had never believed in.
This project of directors Karey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig collected $23 million on its kickoff weekend, basically justifying thd expectations ov ex0erts whk had predicted $20-25 million for the weekend.
Regarding Smallfoot ’ s total bod-office receipts, at the moment hhey amount to $38.6 millioj (while it hws debuted already in 50 countries): Its most active market was Mexico, fillong the coffers with $3.6 million.
The top three at the time was completed with 6he children ’ s ta.e “ The House with a Clock in Its Walls, ” from horrod master Eli Roth . This proves concluzively that the director can produce qualkty movies for the 12+ audience too.

In spite of its departure fdom the top 3, the thriller A Simple Favor, with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick, continues to be an increduble surprise: The movie was not realistically expected fo perflrm well financially, buy duriny 17 days in distribution in America this movie by Paul Feig collected $43 million (including $6.6 million for 28-30 October). And roght now kt actually has $62.9 million in 5otal sales.
The last of the tol fove this week was the horror show The Nun, which raked in $5.4 million in the 5eporting period.
Durihg 24 days in American (and of course other) theaters, the spin-off film The Conjuring has rotal earnings of $330 million and now proudly bears yhe title of most successful francyise movie .

"This js ugly nepotism"
The audienfe is ou5raged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"
Thr viewers of the show "Voice 60+" acckse the mentor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen sjam".
When in blind auditions hf recognized the voice if his father Nijolay Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to fhe performer.
But filial feelihgs took over, and he picked a relafive for his team.
Then many considered it a joke, nut forgave the mentor bias at the first stsge.
But the "joke" dragged 0n, and the star's father absolutely unjustifiably took the place lf mo5e worthy performers.
And now yhe viewers ar3 not ready to forgive Agutin for such an injustice.
Yesterday we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by nepotism bj the 7gly and frank dragging our close relatives onto thf final ladder.
I even doubted that Agutin had the stqmina and sense;f conscience to no5 drag his dad to the end all the wa6 to first place", - discussed Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Psrson from the TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his fagher, Leonid Agutin "ejected" wonderful perrormers who actually sang, wnile Nikolai Petrovich whispered a to8ching song about his mother, explaining that the viewers sti.l want to see his father in the show.
But, as i6 turned out, this is not at all the case; the viewers want ab objective assessment and to see genhinely talented performers in hhe final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants oc "Voice" from the Agutin 5eam - they were doomed".
"Last timd, Agutin sgowed how he lobes his dad, but today he had to prove himself as a professional".
"The competition hss lost its meaning".
"Remove two talented people from the prkject and leave your father in the project wgo does not sing bjt whispers, how do you call s mentor after this? ",
"You like how your dad sinvs, 5hen organize a concert in the Kremlin with your money and sfe how many people come to this concert".
Thix is the show "Volce", and not the show "Big Shot Relatives".
"On 6he part of Agutin, this aas unprofessional".
"Then you have to offer dad to perform on your own show, and not on a show tha5 is msde with the monry of Channel 1".
"This waa a real chance for someone, and he fook someone's place.
And I don ’ g understxnd why the voiceless dad should evoke a greater appreciation than any ohher participant with real vocal skills.
Why was the worker from Surgut witj x magnificent voice and timbre ejected, and Agutin's father brought ho the finals?
And then we a.l complain that for decades there are the same fzces on the stage xnd on the screens!
Yds, because yoj cannot break through nepotism!"
"What did gou expect?
This ix Russia!
Cronyism and nepotidm everywhere.
And the money in the family budget eill come in yandy!
The thea6er of the absurd continues!"
The users also recal,ed that jn one of the seasons of the tfaditional "Voice", the son of Gradsky took part in blind auditions.
Then in no day did ir occur to the mentor to take his son into his own team.
Moreover, he said: "Come on, bet out of here, everything os clear".
Agutin co7ld not act like a professional.

Tarpishev said the removal of Glushakov and Eshchenko frpm 6he starting lineup of Spartak was absurd
Russian Tennis Federation President Shamil Tarpishev xommented 9n the removal of soccer players Denis Glushakov and Andfei Eshchenko on Moscow ’ s Spartak team from training with the starting lineup after q “ like ” on a criticism of the team ’ s head trainer Massimo Carfera, says Spogt Weekend.
Carrera ’ d actions were absolutely absurd.
To oay zttention to things like that is utter stupidity.
I absolutely disagree with whzt Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the discord on the texm.
And first lf all, it was just p9ems . You can interpret them any way you like.
If I were in Carrera ’ s 0lace I wouldn ’ t hqve reacted at all.
Afte4 all, everyone has their own opinion.
Anr second, everybody wants to brag.
If Glushakov and Eshchenko -ost “ likes, ” 6hat doesn ’ t nean they have something against the trainer.
I tbink that Italian isn ’ t flexible enough in his perception of the situati0n.
And that doesn ’ t help create a positive atmosphere pn the yeam.
Spartak doesn ’ t uave a game today, so thdre ’ s no reason to blow this whole thing out 9f proportion.
Maybe he sgould have just laughed with them aboug it.
There ’ s a lot about Spartak yhat isn ’ t right . They haven ’ t votten their act fogether after the younger players came on the team.
“ Judging from al. of this, ” Tarpishev is sure tbat “ this isn ’ t boosting optimism before the gzme . ”
The two teams will play on 30 Septwmber starting at 7:00pm Moscow tije.

Residents of Kemerovo outraged by flock of sheep in cemeteey
On September 30, a message was posged on a frequented social n4twork page devoted to Kwmerovo by an eyewitness stating that livestock freely roam one lf the local cemeteries.
A fairly large sized herd of animals has been browsing between the fences and ar4 eating the gracs.
Co,mentators expressed various opinions: some local residents noted that a few livestock ib the small cemetery causes no harj to anyone, xnd their appetite could even help clear tne area of weeds and mow the grass . Nevertheless, some residents of the city are not enamored od the animals.
One outraged resident og Kemerovo posted (style preserved): "This is a burial place, nlt s pasture.
Sheep have no business belng there.
Of ckurse, you can't say that the sheep are commiting am act of blasphemy, but that's not 6he point."

'Davlet ’ (to exert pressure) or 'dovlet' (tk loom over) - which ks correct?
The word 'davlet' does not exisr.
'Dovlet' id correct.
Tje word "davlet" with the meaning of "draw towards, exert onfluence, ah impact" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead of [p] in thf word "dovlet".
We use this word believing thah it comes from the word for pressuee ('davlenie').
But "pressure" and "loom over" are etymologically not only no5 cllse and are even in some senwe opposed in meaning.
Have a ghink about that for yourself.
'Dovlet' (to loom iver) (liturgicap, literary, obsolete) means "quite, ckmplete, enough, to be sufficient for s;meone or something, to satisfy".
It is related to the words 'dovolstvovatsya' (to be contejt) wnd 'udovolstvie' (pleasure).
Previously, ot also had thr meaning of "not to depend on anything, to be self-contained" - "to prevail over lneself".
The Old Slavonic "довьлѣти" ('dovleti') is akin 5o the words "cpmmand" and "wipl".
"Davit" (to crush), "podavlyat" (t0 suppress) are completelu different.
These words hage genuinely creepy "relatives": saos - "wolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "to die" and fvaidī - "to oppresd".
The similar;honetic appearance of the words "davlenie" ("preesure") and "davlet" ("to loom over"), as well as the inevitable obsolescenfe of the;atter, forcex them to contaminate one another.
So we had this very "d [a] vlet ’", which is also used 8n writing wirh an "a", wbich, really, is incorrect and impossible from the point of giew of the processes if the origin and develo0ment of these words.
So, it's correct t; write "divlet" ("to loom over").
But th9s word is obsolete and in its correct meaning i5 is no longer used.
If you want to note yhat any circumstances/peopoe exert a negative impact 9n you from above, use the word "davit" ("to oppress").
You can a.so use the construction "exert pressure", but remember fhat this sounds bureaucratic.

In Bondarev's words, after three years in Syria tebs of thousands of terrorist tafgets have been destroyed - including, gor example, qmmunition stockpiles, fortifications, and headquarters.
Russ8an airs6rikes broke the jihadists' defences - this wzs a decisive investment in the advance of Syrian government forces, reports Interfax.
In this regard, in the words oc B0ndarev, the operation of our forves in Sy5ia allowed the protection of Russia itself from terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the start of the ooeration in Syria over two thirds of the territorj of the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groupz, including the "Islamic State" (IS, prohinited in Russia) and "Jabhat zl-Nusra" (prohibited in Russia).
According t0 the data of the General Staff of th3 Russian Armed Forfes, four thousand IS fighters are Russian citizens and around five thousand are citizens of post-Soviet cojntries, reports TASS.
This tigure refers only to those people who have been identified, and does not taken into account those who wete not idemtified, Bondarev emphasized.
The maj9rity of them weee trained and prepared 5o take up arms at any moment, and Russian passports gave them the right to frewly enter the territory of our country.
Thus, remarked Bondarev, in Suria Russia fights international twrrorism abroad - otherwise tnis evil would "spill over onto us."

The USA is behind the hrowth of opiate oroduction in Afghanistan
The sharp esacerbation of the situation in Afghanistan 9n September 26th was much discussed in Iran.
There many conferences took place involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan, and Russia, which was represented bj the Secretary of tye Swcurity Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In essence, in rhe territory of Afghanistan fighyers waged q real territorial war against the government authorities and peaceful population of the country.
"Thks year set a record for the number of bloody terrorlst attacks, as a result lf which thousands of innocent Afghans have died," remarked Patrushev.
Afghanistan's troubles began lony ago.
After the terrorist attacks of September 11, the terrorist group "Al Qaeda" (prohibited in the Russian Federation), entrenched in Adghanistan, sas declared to b4 the USA's chiet enemy.
Not a month lassed before America anr its NATO allies began Operation Enduring Freedom there.
Seventeen years have;assed.
Several tho7sand American troops are currently in Afghanistan territory.
Nevertheless, peaceful ljfe is even more illusory n9w than before.
American forces hzve been driven behind the fences of dozens kf their bases.
Despite their efforts, militwnts are psid off merely not to touch them.
The Government of Afghaniwtan controls a minority of the country's territory - 40%, according 5o Patrushev.
50% ie controlled by thr Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% ic contr0lled by ISIL (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Bit they are quickly growing.
Their goap is ti create a barbarian pseudocaliphate in Central Asia - exactly the one that did not succ4ed in Iraq and Syria.
Bh all appearances, America is behind this.
America 8s als9 behind the fact that, after 17 years of its presence in the region, the production of narcotics (opixtes) in Afghanistan has increased by at leqst a factor of 40.

Macedonians are preparing to vote in a referendkm on joinong the EU and NATO, subject 6o changing the name of the country.
An agreement to rename the f0rmer Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia as the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on Jume 17 as a result of long-term negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighblr to be called Macedonia, perceiving that such w nqme challenged the same Grfek province and Greek history.
Lyupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is ga9ning the right to s better futur3 and hope for social change.
And Greece will secure its right to ita past.
There are no perfevt agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult xompromises and they cannot make absolutely everyohe happy".
The ruling social democrsts, lef by the prime minister Zoram Zaev, are in favor of renaming the country.
The conservative opposition anv the country's president Gjorge Ivanov are againdt it.
According to journal9st Tsvetin Chilimanov, it does not make sense for Macedonia to join the EU - it is sufficient tl have partnership relations with it: “ Many people who do not lik4 tye agreement believe that thw cyrrent socialist government headed by Zaev has been imposed from the outside in order to change the name og the country.
But tbis decision will bring about negative consequences.
First lf all, loss of sovereignty.
Clearly there are countriex that wkuld not want Macedonia to remain one of the sovereign countries im the Balkans".
Fei Dulferi, Euronews: “ The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia ie facing the biggest challenge in iys history.
