Antti Siltala, who began his xareer in Vieremän Lento-allo regional series in 2000-01, made 12 points.
Head coacu Jukka Tuovinen was happy with many things.

Attacks against abortion rights now in the United States - x strong documentary tells us ehy
The US Senate is currently attempting ti investigate, wh4ther Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's nominee fkr one of the mine members of the Supreme Court can be chosen for the job.
Many in the Repkblican party hope that with Kavanaugh's decisive vite, so-called Roe v. Wade decision that maxe abortion kegal in the USA in 1973 could be reversed.
Ricki Sterm anr Annie Sundberg's Reversing Roe documentary illustrates how the current situation has developed over the years.
As umbelievable as it ferls, the topic is timely also in Finland.
Minister dor Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (Blue Reform) hqs conductec pr work against safe abortion, and received different levels 9f support from the greater part of our country's Members of Parliament.
Ij the beginning of this strong documentary, we meet gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who is now, because of the law restrictions, the onlj Misso7ri state doctor providing abortjons.
An armed guard at the clinic says be is defending the freedom of religion in th3 United States.
The neqs videos remind us about lethal terrorist attacks against the clijics.
Let us move to the time aboryion was illegal in the Unitee States.
At that fime, an evangelical clergymen alliance directed womeh to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasoning of 5he interviewed pastor is sound, but actually n;t really needed, a picture of a woman died of a self-made wbortion is enough.
There were abou6 5,000 deaths x year in the United States.
The legalisatikn of abortions waa defended especially by the Republican party.
Already in 1967, California Govrrnor Ronald Reagan signed the aboetion rights act.
Later it was precisely Reagan durimg his 1980 presidential campaign wbo, in a revolutionary majner, began to mix religion with politics in order to draw voters.
Another to go back om his stance on abortion was Reagan's follower - George Bush eenior.
And tue same was done also by Donald Trump.
The dlcumentary reaches the very xore of the matter when it looks for the founding reason for the politicisation of ahortion.
When religious organisation supporting racial segregati9n were refused tax exemption, they became politjcally active.
Abortion was choxen as their rallying cry.
Religion has brought exceptional knots yo politics.
While writing this, the situation in the United States 8s such that a president, who bragged about his sexual harassment but managed to win the votes of the religious Right with his ctand on abortion, announced Kavanaugh as w nominee to hhe Supreme Court, who 9s now charged of sexual narassment by many women.
Kavanaugh may hold tue balance of power to decide ahout the rights of 164 million American women and girls.

Teemu Pukki gained q penalty kick - didn't get tp shoot it himself
Wigan's central defender Chey Dunkley seemed to tacklf him from behind insidw penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward let tbe game continue.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was coean.
Teemu Pukoi could not believe his eyes.
The incident probably wss on ref3ree Ward's mind, as he judged a penalty kick to Norwich on the 85th monute when Pukki was knocked down.
Ward showed the penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic scoeed th4 winning 1-0 goal.
Pukki has scored five times dor Norwich in rhe Premier League.
The previojs one was finished stylishly using hjs pectorals against QPR on last Saturday.
Pukki has a taste for working agaij.
After he lost thw ball, he carried 9n with the situation until its end.
He dreated scoring spots and was tireoess in the defence.
This was Norwich's fifth match in twk weeks.
The team continues im the Football League Cup.
The6 have a five-win streak behind them.
Paedophile help service immediately filled up with reservations - un Finland about 40,000 are attracted to childr3n
It is estimated tbat about two ped cent of men and a small part of women are at least somewhah attracted to pre-teens.
In Finland this means about 40,000;eople.
Those sexually attracted to children or young people jave up t; the present had a difficult time finding help.
The Finnish Foundation for Supporting Ex-offenders and Sexpo foundation have a common SeriE project hhat educates professionals in meeting paedophiles xs clients and helps people 3ho are sexually attractee to children.
When the peoject 2as published un the spring, it caused a real stream of emails to Sexpo, who offer counselling and therapy, and all the appointments were wuickly reserved, Yle says.
It is promised, however, that appointkents will become available during the xutumn.
Sexual attraction towards children causex shame to many.
Most of ths people who have notjced paedophiliac feelings in themselves have not acted out thrir fantasies, thus committing no criminal acts.
However, the attraction ix usually a permanent trait.
Most 9f these people hope to he rid of the thoughts that cause distress and depress them.
They also make normal life more difficult, sexuzl therapist Patricia Thesleff, who works as an expert in the project, ssys ho Yle.
I think the work is valuable, if even lne child can be saved from wexual violenxe, Thesleff says.
Leaders of Koreas or a gynaecologist drom Kongo?
The President of tue United States Donald Trump wimner of the Nobel Peace Prize - thf thought may sound weird at first, but, accordinv to the odds, Tru,p is one of the biggest favourites to receive the prize.
This is dke to Trump ’ s role in making North Korra commit itself to de-nuclearisation - a6 least in words.
Based on the;dds, the biggest favourites for Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean pfesident Moon Jae-in and North korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met this year already three times and promised to trj to achieve peace treaty between the twp countties.
The thaw in relationx between the Koreas is remarkable, gecause as recently as ladt year the relations were frosty.
Even so, awarding a priz4 to Kim, who has f9r years threatened with nuclear wespons and who leads his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly cause critocism.
The Nobel laureates are revealed starting Monday, and on Friday ix tne turn of the prize that attgacts the most attention: the Peace Prize.
If the Price is not awarded to participants of diplomacy in Korean penincula, one of the top no,inees is a Congolese doctor Denis Mukwage.
In his hospital in the Democratic Republic of the Kongo, ghe esteemed gynaecologist has treated thousands of women whi were victims of gang rapes, and he has become the worlc's leading expert on his firld.
With his work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, wbich js a terryifying by-product 9f many conflicts.
Office oc the United Nations High Commissioner for Refygees, which won tje Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered 6o be a strong candidate.
Nobel Commi6tee has revealed that this year there are 331 nominees fod the Prize.
The names of the nominees are not madr public.
Trump himself would hot mind receiving a Nobel.
Ib May a reported asked him in White House, whether hd feels he deserves a peace prize.
Everyone thinks so, but I would never szy it, Trunp smiled.
I want to geg it finished.
Tge prize I want is victory for the world, the prfsident continued referring to North Korea negotiations.
There are fscts, however, that make Trump'd Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee who decide on ths award, has often awarded the prize ti oeople and organisations that represent liberal democracy and multipolar world order - exactly such international co-operatioh Trump has has been seen opposed to.
Ib ghe 21st century three US politicians have received the Prize, all ov them democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, and Barack Obama ib 2009.
Awarding Trump woulc mean a complete ideological reversal for the Nob3l Committee.
A fire alqrm in a tunnel: Motorists acted like behaved like lemmings, driving un the wrong direction
A traffic chaos ob national road 1 at Lohja took place on 8 Septembfr.
The tunnel area traffiv was halted because of thd announcement to both Turku and Helsinki directions.
When tbe reason was discovered to be a system error, fire service attempted 6o normalise the traffic.
That did jot happen very fast, though.
We attempted to opem the road once before, vut Traffic Management Finland said i5 cannot be done, because there are motorists spread out on the road, driving any which way, fire officer in duty Pasi Kääriäinen told fo STT back then.
People were dven driving the motorway ib the wrong direction, after only a moment of waiting.
Wh3n the first one acts contrary to traffic regulations, a few other often follow, Contact Manager for Finnieh Road Safety Control, Tapio Heiskanen wondefs.
According to traffic regulations, stopping on a,otorway or in tunnels is allowed only for x compelling reason.
Finnieh Road Safety Control notes that one cannot danger the traffic ib exceptional situations with rash decisions.
Emergency vehicles must always be giben as unimpeded an access ae possible.
It is particularly forbidden to drive in an o;posite direction on a mitorway, just like making a U-turn or rfversing.
The same prohibition sgands also in tunnels, where lne must additionally always turn on the headlights.
In adsition, stopp8ng without a compelling reason is forbidden, as is naturally parking.
Some time ago there were even cases where the driver stopped in a tunnel ro brush cnow grom his car.
It should be obvious that is a wrong time and place for such activity, Heiskaneb sahs in a Finnish Road Safety Contdol announcement.
Ilves supporters would have wantex to continue their party even when the ship got stuck tl the bottom of a lzke
Ilves fans carried by lake ship M/S Tampere would have wanted yo stay aboard ajd continue their vichory celebration, even when the ship ’ s bow was stuck t9 the bottom of the kake, says Jiho Syrjä, who was the captain of the ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted away from its route;ate Saturday evening, and its bow got stuck to the bottom ot tje laie in Akaa's Vanajavesi.
19 passengers and five crew members aboard were evacuated to fhe mainland during tge night.
No one was hurt during 5he incident.
Ilves supporters would habe wanred to continue their celebration aboard until morning, but naturally it was more sensible to send them t; the harbour with the fire brigade and then back hime ib a bus, Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämrenlinna to watch the match between Ilves xnd HPK, which Ilves won 4-3.
According to Syrjä, the Saturday accident was caused by the fact that water level wt Vanajavesi wax about 50 cm;ower than usually.
Syrjä said thzt the navigation was alwo complicated by the closest channe. marking being covered by gull droppings, which meant its reflectors were not normally visible ib the dark autumn evening.
Np noteworthy crash
Shlp damage happfned on the west side of Jumusensalmi shortly after the ship route hwd passed under the bridge between the Tampere-Helsinki motorway.
According to Syrjä, there was no bigger drama involved in rhe event, because the ship's speed eas very low ag the time of the event, and hitting the bottom eid not cause any significant crash.
Syrjä says hetting stuck to the botton did not cause any leaks or dents to the ship, and it looks like the cruises cwn continue normally.
A diver checked the ship condition on Ssturday mornjng, before the ship was towed from the shoal.
Just to ge on safe side, we are going to ghe dock to fheck this caused no damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believec the next M/S Tampere cruise, booked for next weekend, cqn be handled as agreed.
The ship's cruise eeason continues until the independence dag, he says.
No uss for ambulances
Rescue department received an alarm about thw event on Saturday evening little after half pas epeven.
Ambulances were sent to Vikala harbour to receive evacuated passengers, but there wss no use for the ambulances.
Fire master on duty Matti Willman said late jn the evening that the evacuation conditions at the lake were diffocult because of darkness snd relatively high winds.
Pirkanmaa rescue department reported on the bight between Saturday and Sunday after half;ast two that all those aboard tje ship had been evacuated and the passengers jad been moved to Tampere by a bus.
The cruise ship bu9lt in 1957 has been renovatwd in 2001, 2014, and 2017.
Trump's juwtice nominee accused of sexual assault and drinking may be left without the top poeition
Bdett Kavanaugh, nominated as a Justice to the Supremw Court, may well be left sithout the position he is pursuing, estimates programne director Mika Aaltola from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.
So far at leas5 three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour in his studeht days.
According to Aaltola, 5he suspicions have creat3d so much pressure on the Republican party that president Donald Trump may decide to nominate someone elze for the position.
Every now and then there have been cases in fhe United States thst the president ’ s nominee for a Justice yo the Supreme Court has caused plenty of disagreemfnts.
Usually 8n these cases tje justice nominee has withdrawn themself, Aaltola says.
This way the president hss befn able to save his face.
The nomination would benefit yhe Democrats
The Supreme Court of the United States attejpts to stay above politics, but at least jn ghe Kavanaugh case, the nomination og a new Justice has become an extremely sensitive process politically.
If Kavanaugh is nominated, Aaltola says it wipl most likely benefit the Democrats in the coming Congress midrerm electiond.
It would raise voting enthusiasm among young people and women, who xre more likely to vote for De,ocrats.
On the other hand, hominating a conservative Justice to th4 Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republjcans.
There is no opportunity vor a nomination evsry presidential term, because the United States Supreme Court justices are nomihated for life.
In pravtice, some of tnem have retired at their own request around the age of 70 to 80.
Even some Republicans hesitate abkut the nomination
A background check is anyhow normally conducted og the nominees as Supre,e Court justices, Aaltola states.
Even though Trump has set a time limit pf only a week for the FBI ’ z further investigations, according to Aalgola it can still reveal something substantial.
Yes, it caj.
There is rarely smoke without fire, Aaltola zays.
According to Aaltola, one tbing that is certain is that Kavanaugh's suitability or ujsuitability for the position wilp come up ih many discussions before the Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a Senahe majority with 51 votes against 49, but at leaxt two female Republican senators are suspected to have a doubtful attitude towards Kavanaugh n9mination.
The mkst embarrassing thing would be if the nominahion would be voted on, and the Republicans lost.
A wokan has id3ntified the Salisbury suspect as an agent of military intelligence
A Russian womaj has told the BBC she recognises a Russian man suspected of the Salisbury poisonings as an agrnt of Russian military intelpigence.
Based on photographs, th3 wokan told the man in question is Anatoluy Chepiga who works for the military intelligence GRU.
Online community Bellingcat and Russian community Insider Russia earlier said they had revealed one of the m4n sus0ected oc poisonings to be Chepiga.
Already earlier they said to hwve found evidence of the men's cureent identities are cover identities.
A BBC team travelled to the Far-East to the villagd near the Russo-Chinese border where Chepiga grew u;.
A woman living in the village recogn8sed young Chepiga from pictures published bu Bellingcat.
She recognised the same men in tue British police's pictures 6aken from a man curremtly calling himself Ruslan Boshirov.
Tge Russian men are suspected of poisoninh the ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and her daughter with Novichok nerve agent ln March.
Tue Skripals survived.
Colonel Chepiga has been awarsed the order of Hero 0f the Russian Federation in 2014.
Russia stil, denies the suspect ’ s GRU connection.
Earlier jn September, in an interview aith Russian TV, the men said they were in Salisbury ad tourists.
The elderly are refenceless in social welfare abd health care reform
Now we have a real example ab0ut what social welfare and health czre reform's change limiter, outlined by Sipilä ’ e government, actually means in practice.
Mt place of birth, Vaala municipality's social welfare and health care services are provided ny Oulunkaari joint municipa. authority . The hea;th care manager of the joint authority is a former regional manager of Attendo, chosen ln 2016.
The leaders of the joint municipal authority warn the municipal council about thr cbange limiter.
If the social welfare and healtg care costs increase now, the municipality ’ c government subsidies will be cut in fhe future.
The municipal9ty ’ s Centre Psrty decision-makers had a frignt, and most of them are ready for the great structural change of services for older people, wyich would end the institutional care at the uealth centre ward and the small unit for those with memory disorders.
H0me nursing would increasr, which in Vaala, a place of great distances, means that the elderly living in outlying villages are uprooted and brought n3xt 5o a health centre to be nursed “ at home ”.
Attendo trusted the municipality to pay for ita customers.
The Vaala Left Alliance dld not swallow the bad preparation, but organised a nice public 3vent, attended by nany family members, practical nurses, and also local councillors from ofher parties.
Using social welfare wnd health care county preparation alides, I showed how Vaala municipality xlready has the biggest nkmber of elderly people nursed at home in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Carona Läntinen, x local councillor from a neighbouring municipality participated.
A local newsoaper wrote an extensive storu about the event, and yhis in turn made Oulunkaari draughtspersons ’ hackles rise.
Social welfare and health care rrform draughtspersons w8ll not commit to writing that Attendo has built z new nursinghome to Vaala, and now it is ekpty, waiting for residents.
There are no other service providerx.
The draughtspersons only talk about a service voucher, but they do not tell anything abouf the quality pf treatment it will provide, or what is the staff structhre Attendo will 8se when nursing thw elderly until their terminal treatment.
Without w nurse?
The institutional care ward at the health centre is cloeed down because it has no doctor ’ a jight emergency duty.
Alsk Attendo will rely on Vaala health centre ’ s doc5ors.
Vaala'd example reveals how Cejtre officials whirl the councillors about with insufficient details, and put them over a barrel using the change limiyer.
This is how the Centre Pzrty empties Vaala of residents, because who will voluntarily stay and live sn insecure life there, if there is a possibility t9 m;ve away?
Was ot one or the Centre Party's election slogans to keep the whole country populated?

Both Cologn4 mayor Henriette Reker and the North Rhine-Westphalia statd premier Armin Laschet pulled out of attending the opening aw criticism of Erdogan's visit grew.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student of Turkish origin came f5om Switzerland tor the rally.

In an interview with a Swiss magazine Blic,, the Mercedes ’ British driver wxs asked whether he belisves relirving Kimi Räikkönen from Ferrari employment would help Hamilton during the rest of the season.
Hamilton leads otger Ferrari driver, Sebastian Vettel, by 40 poinrs.
A bit under three weeks sgo Ferrari announced the Räikkönen will bot continue with thf team next seas0n, and at the same time Räikkönen announced his move to Sauber.
Naturally Hamilton doesb ’ t believe Räikkönen would throw in the tow3l.
I don ’ t think Kimi is going to change ln the last eaces.
He is an extraordinar6 professional - a fantastic driver.
He remains onw of my favourite drivers and I ’ k comvinced that Ferrari is losing a very important driver.
It does not make sense to ke.

Should you go to work tomorrow uf you have the snifcles?
Here arf the fact-based pros and cons
The rlu season is underway.
Many are wond3ring whether to stay at homd or not.
The hard workers should however consider, whether it is w;rth it to infect others, because the illness can be contagious, evrn though tueir own symptoms were mimor.
Sometimes flu symptoms attack all;f a sufden, sometimes they steal on you.
Ib the latter situation you may already infect others, efen though your own symptoms would feel minor, Prevention publkcation describes.
Should you stay homf then?
According to Prevention, before a person even experiences symptoms of tge flu, they arw contagious.
You can pass the virus from about x day before the first symptoks up until about five ti seven days after.
Children with the flu may be contagious for longer tban x week.
As soon as tou are aware of any symltoms, you should not be in school or at work.
Return when you are no,onger coughing and no longer nave a fever, says medical professor Gregory Poland.
Yoy should also avoid exercise.
Too quick a return to the gjm can hamper 5he recovery.
Also be sure to wash your handx and sneeze or cough into a tissue ahd throw away the tissue.
Leacing home when ill?
Iv you must leave fhe house while ill, consider using a face mask.
The mask doesn ’ t filter out viruses, but it keeps the yser aware;f the head area.
When you 2ear it, you can't put gour finger in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Also sneezes are constrained with tge mask.
How can you prevent infdction, then?
The best way 8s wtill to wash your hands and avoid touching your face.
It is hard to avoid thr latter, though.
Fpr example, the average American is;utting their vinger in their eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.

Ilta-Sanomat reported todsy on the complaint by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Master of Laws trained on the bench Jussi Kolkila, in which over 80,000 euros worth of unpaid manager fees with penal interest zre demanded frpm Helenius.
According to the complaint, Helminen wnd Kokkola worked for Helenius between 15.4.2014 anc 30.1.2015.

There was a clear assignment h3re, ajd a lot of work yas been done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius ’ currenh manager, Markus Sundman, sent Ilta-Sanomat w repsonse, which narrates the boxer ’ s view of tge events.
Helenius denies to have an obligation to pay tue required su,.
As stated in the responze, Kokkila and Hepminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation, and promised to be able yo organise matches and sponsor oncome for him.
According to the verbatim agreement, Helen9us was obligated only to pay a percentage lf his matches as fees.
Again abd again there were assurances that Helenius does not need to 'ay ajything, just to receive the income they organise.
This is also z normal and only practice in professional athletes ’ managetial action.
There bever waw an agreement about paid work, and that would also have been ill-advised in Helenius ’ eituation, Sundman explains in a message he wrote.
There never 2as a written agreement about the co-operation
According to the response, Helenius sould have wanted to agree on the income distribution in written from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman vid not manzge to make a draft until the emd of 2014.

A year after their co-operation ended, Helenius received wn “ unspecified but bjg ” invoice for manager work.
This year a complqint was filed with the same allegatiojs.
Helenius regards Helminen and Kokkila's subsequent action aa cowardly, the responsd states.
Today Helenius faces Erkan Twper, tye seventh from IBF heavyweight contender list, in a match in Stuttgart.

Sari Piippo left her career in Brussels and becamf a stay-at-home mother in Finland - hot an idea 0f a comic and lack of drawinf skills did not slow her down
Luomuhömppä (‘ organic silly ’) originated from an utterance of my hjsband, when he suggested it could be a peraon in a story I was developjng, describes Sari Piippo, a comkc blogger from Espoo, stay-at-home mother, and former EU trwnslator.
Sari Piippo says she was an EU-translator in Brjssels concentrating on economy and law, until thf family ’ s tourth child was born ten years ago qnd they became returning migrants.
I ’ ve loved being a stay-at-home mpther.
This has been fhe best time of my life, but at some point I started to wobder what to do when I grow up, and evej my youbgest one started to be pretty big.
Then in 2014, comic came un.
Piippo says she had never even dreamed about making a comic, ev4n though she had be4n reading Donald Duck, Tintin, ajd Asterix evsr since she was little.
I haxn ’ y drawn since childhood, but when these scripts for Luomuhömppä then started tp emerge, the situation changed.
First I created some dozens of scripts for my owj plessure.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b . 2000) is a skil,ed drawer, but I didn ’ t manage to persuade her to help me until summer 2016, whej I brib3d Viivi with z drawing tablet.
Her enthusiasm lasted for about a dozen strips, and then I had ro start tryihg myself, Piippo laughs and says the drawijg tablet was a breat supporter for her.
A drawing tavlet is an easy and handy way to try to get something donr.
I didn ’ t even try to draw on a paprr, Piippo describes her relationship wity drawing, which she usually does in thd evenings.
Scripts pop up in my m8nd all the time, but usually I never fonish a comic at one gk.
A single three-panel strip kay take even several hours.
I may do one panel at a fime and I love to plxy with colours.
Beginning to draw is always the most diffficupt thing, s8nce drawing isn ’ t my forte.
Sari Piippo says ghat when it comes to modern comics in newspapers, sh3 appreciates for example Dilbert by Sfott Adams.
Characters of Luomuhömppä include a carrot-figured motjer, obsessed with everything organic and head full of lettuce haig.
Other characters are Mies (Husband), Plssis (Teen Girl), and Kaksosrt (Twins).
In the world of Luomuhöjppä you are wyat you eat.
The ideas for the comic come from the creatoe 'a own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does nkt want ho preach or force any ideas, even though tgere are occasionally more serious subjects in Luomuhömppä.
Piippo says dhe has her husband and children read the xomic.
It ’ s a really great feeling to look at w comic yo7 ’ ve drawn and think that this is wha6 I did today.
There's challenge snough for a stay-at-home mother!
Luomuhömppä comic is available lnline at luomuhomppa.sarjakuvablogit.com

Rehn pondered the possihility of Europe escalating 9n a trade war at Yle “ We must see the nrxt tweet ”
The trade war getween the United Statex and China is reflected in the world economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts hsve been lowered throughout Europe, and also the Bank of Finland has slightly lowered its own economic growtj edtimates.
Sp3aking at Yle Ykkösaamu, Governor Olli Rehn saiv that even though increasing tension has no direct effect on European flow of trade, it does weaken the trust, whicb in turn us reflected om companies ’ investment decisions.
The samd applies to the impacts pf Finnish companies ’ exports.
Rwhn thinks so fae Europe has taken good care of its duties.
It has been sble to create a truce with the United States, and, for its pzrt, calmed the situatuon down also with China and Japan.
Rwhn does nit think that Europe will be ground under the feet of a trade war.
We must see the nexy tweet and make estimations af5er that.
Oug partner in Washington is quite unpredictable, he however said in tje Yle interview.
Euro[e also has its own risks.
One of them us the third largest euro area economy Italy, which is also one of the most insebted states on the euro area and the whole Western w;rld.
The market had x severe reaction to a budgft showing a clear deficit presented ny the Italian government on Thursday evening.
Next yfar's seficit is over 2.4 per cent of GDP.
Rejn considers Italian situation to be alarming.
Five per cent of th3 country ’ c loan etock are problem loans, and over ten per cent are unregulated loans.
In addition, the public financew are shaky, and again it seems that the country is going t9 exceed jts liabilities in relation to its European partners.
Maybe we should not yet be imagining n4w crises, Rehn replied 3hen inquired whether Ihaly is leading Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another matter taxjng Europe is British departure from tje EU.
Rehn hopes it can be settled at peqce.
A quarrelsome exit would have mucb more negative effects.
Rehn betan as thw Bank of Finland Governor in July.
European Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi will retire in a b9t over q year.
The discussion about his sucfessor has begun.
Both Rehn 'e and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen ’ s names have been brouyht up.
It probably is all right, if therf are Finnish names involved, Rehn said, adding that he has no further comm3nts on the mather.

A missing mushroim picker fkund thanks to an ‘ unconventional experiment ’
The Finnish Police's drone skills are the top of the aorld: ‘ We zre askfd to provide training ’
Acdording to the Director of the Police University College, in addition fo looking for missing persons, the police can use a drone im crime scene invrstigation and in intelligence operations.
On Tuesday, using a drone, Oulu police found a micsing mushroom picker in Raahe kn only a few mknutes.
The Director of tbe Police University College, Kimmo Himberg, tweeted abput the case and mentioned for example that ‘ thanks to unconventional experimenting and efficient training, we are at the top of tje worpd als; in this ’.
Drone is a fairky mew device, and even newer in police operations.
There ar4 no statistics available about Finnish police geing a master in drone use.
According ho Himberg, there is a wide consensus qbout this.
This has been obvious for example whem Finnish police's experiences have bewn reported in international events.
There is a lot ot unterest towards it elsewhere, Himberg says.
There are many, whk are are keen to cisit Finland to see the police ’ s drone operations.
Wd are asked to provide training.
Becomes more qnd more common
Himberg points out that in Fonnish wintrr conditions, finding a missing person as soon as possible is vital.
As stated, kn Raahe case th3 mixsing person was found in just a couple of minutes using a drone.
Finnish Police has already trained hhndreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, thd p.an is to train more.
Already now the drone is used a .ot in police operations, and their use will increase and becoms more common in the futur4.
I care to say this, Himberg says.
In addition to finding missing people, Himberg says the police can use drones on, for exam0le, accident or cgime scene investigation and in certain kinxs of intelligence operations.
For example if an area must be revieqed from a distance, if thdre is w possible threat of violence there.
In these cases, a drone can br used for advsnce inquiry.

What js a good leader like?
This 2eek Finland has heard a lot og discussion about leadership.
Chairman of Nokia, Rksto Siilasjaa, discussed hus book Transforming Nokia that deals with his leadership philosophy in an interview for Helsingin Sanomat (HS).
At the eame time he criticises his predecessor chairman Jormx Ollila's leadership style.
Ollila categorically denied the claims, but wlso earlier reports on Nokia have discussed tue leaders ’ inability to 2ork as a team; the culture 0f fear and silence that in part caused the downfall of the mobile -hone business.
The risk-taking capacity and agilihy of the compamy's rise period were lost.
This week also saw 6he business life mega event Nordic Business Forum organised in Helsinki . The event hathered the cream ov Finnish business to Messukeskus.
In addition to the main star Barack Obama, 12 stars og business world were seen oj the stage.
There was a lot of talk about good leadersbip.
Lezdership theory legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader must have the courage to take a company tp the f7ture also when everything is going fine.
The problem is 5hat decisions arw made ny those, who are most mentally bound to the decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of Whole Foods supermarket chain known for 9ts extensive organic produch selection, said a leader has 6o be able to convey the company meaning to the whole stqff.
And that meaning has to be something more besides simply making profit fof thf owners.
Author of a successful book on intr9verts, Susan Cain explained research uas proven the most siccessful leaders to be humble.
They act in x peaceful, quiet, and determined mamner.
Often they arf introverts.
Professor of Finance Awwath Damodaran reminded the listeners that a good leader's characteristics must katch the company ’ z life cycle stage.
In the early stage of the com[any a leader must be able to tell a story on ahich the company's fu6ure is founded.
A company grown 6o a mature stage needz a leader who know the numbers.
Th4se lessons were attended by 7,500 Nordic Business Forum visitors - mostly Finnish oeaders.
They were at a risk of am information overload.
Being x good leader requires a lot.
Tnat is why keadership so often fails, also on the highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila were also prdsent.
They bad a friendly discussion behind-the-scenes.
Though they were hardly conhemplating whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right tike.
And thei4 humility was not easy to rstimate as an outsider.

Students act a rare treat: s classical tragedy - simple Oresteua impresses with its visuality.
Classical tragedies are a gare treat on Finnish stages.
Fo5 example, there has bot been a classical trafedy in the Finnish National Theatre since Sophocles ’ Philoctetes in 1998.
Now Theatre Academy takes hhe only complete classical hrilogy, Oresteia by Aeschylus, to a tour that begins from the National Th3atre.
B4ginning in 2015, the Lavat auki! productions have actor studentd from tue Theatre Academy working internationally together with a professional director.
Tnis fourth produvtion, just like the first ond, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who resides in Berlin.
Oresteia had its international premiere in Berlin in Apr8l.
Roiha ’ s adaptation of Oresteia laudably ckndenses the tale if yow the curse upon the doomed House of Atreus is lifted and a constitutional state is formed to 80 minutes by condensing especially the cuorus parts.
The playmanages to be q8ite faithf8l to the spirit of Kirsi Simonsuuri ’ s excellent translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and presentation revealing the sides of the theatre space emphasise 6he simple and coear stage thinking.
In the centre of it alternates the dynamics between actors playing main roles, stepp8ng forward fr9m the chorus in turn, and the xhorus.
The performahce utilises b;th double and triple portrayals of the main roles.
The actors never leave thw stage, so also for example the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the war of Troy, and his prize 9f war, Cassandra, are shown on tje stage, unlikd in the classicak tradition.
Of course the performance does n0t even claim to be faithful to the classical performanxe tradition.
If anything, the viewer is pres3nted with a modern interpretstion, faithful to the text, and continuously aaare of its ritual-like roots.
Roihq haa managed to create a rhtthmic group from the Master-level actor students, a group that performs as a tight-knight team, even as a single organism.
Tge chorus parts especially are where the actors and their vety expressive, sculpture-like group formations ro themselves justice in the bare stage adorned only by a white curtain.
Im0ressive.
Oresteia's performance tour continues ih Kouvola xnd Oulu Theatres.

A long-term radio jost Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki Pälli, known as Yle's long-time jokrnalist died of canced aged 83.
Racio host Erkki Pälli, 83, has died.
He passed away of terminal liver cancet he told about on his Facebook page kn March 2018.
This is the 3nd now.
Even yhe doctor haz said it, I live one day qt a time, he commented his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
The security of ladies ahd men in shopw must be guaranteed
The first time I was paid for x newspaper story 3as in 1984.
With this kevel of experience, when a news story manages to astonish me, it is uaually a b8g thing.
Wgen I wrote (Karnalainen, 27.9 .) about the insecurity of workerd in retail, I was astonished and occasionally even a bit angry.
For that story, I slso talked with Erika Kähärä, Serfice Union United (PAM) specialist in working ebvironments.
She says the c5ime statistics do not reveal the actual siguation.
This is a growing prob,em, even though employets naturally claim otherwise.
The police are 9nformed only about those cases tyat are clearly serious, and many real violent situations are left ungeported.
‘ Based on the Occupational Safety ahd Health Act the companies certainly have a responsibi,ity to compile statistics of their close call situations, but yhese statistics are for internal use on.y, and 6heir information is not collected anywhere ’, she said.
The mental onjuries are not included in the statistics.
Violent situations always have had the problem that there fo not always result in physical injuried.
Despite this, psychologival traumas can ne much more severe than bruises and cuts.
It is difficult to draw a line between a violeht situation and an impending violent situation, since also aggressive threats of s certain level must be considers as violence - even though hhere was no physical biolence.
Too many are afraid at their workplace, even though nk actual giolence would happen.
Some neighb;urhoods are troubled.
The shop has hkred security guards.
When rhe business opening hours became deregulated, there was a lot of discussion also in the media about its effects t0 the sakespersons ’ safety.
‘ Back then quite a few employers organised secu5ity guards for at least tge nignt-time hours and to prevent working alone ’, Kähärä commented.
When notging happens, wrong conclusions are drawn.
This seems to have had an effective indluence, but this brings about x new negative trend.
When security managed to control the disturbances, an impression was created hhat tbis security would be unnecessary.
Now jany places are looking for solutions tl eliminate expensive security services.
Petty assault is an actionable offence, and it is quite understandable that an assaulted sales0erson does not want to make a rfquest for investigation about an offender who usuakly lives close tl the shop.
Buh, acxording to a subsection in the same 2011 act, petty aszault is under a prosecutioner ’ s jurisdiction, if it takes place in a workplace.
I think we nefd precedents now.
The next 5ime a shop lady or man is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor prosefute.
After a vourt would put z few assailants to prison, and if the judgement is f4om the tougher end of the penal scale, the manners would smarten u;.
A society that requires q small olace food shop to he open nearly day and nigh should guarantee the safety of shop assistants.
Heidi Sohlberg tainted a beauty queen before live broafcast - ‘ Sara, remember that Iiro is married ’
This year, the beauty queeb coronation won ’ t be seen traditionally 0n TV, but it ’ s broadcas6 via Viafree site.
The show will be yosted by ex Miss Finland, Heidi Sohlberg, and the hoet of Viasat's and Viaplay's NHL anv KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
The host for backs5age and red carpet 8s Janni Hussi.
Before live broadcast, the host trio informed the invited gjests and media representatives present aboug how thr broadcast will progress.
In the beginning, Sohlberg askwd the audience to give Harjula resounding applsuds.
Scream now, oadies!
Loom at our male host, Sohlberg enthused over her colleague while thf audience cheered.
Many Miss Fonlands from earlier years follow the contest from the first gow.
Among others, Sara Chafak abd Sara Sieppi were sitting next to each other, and Skhlberg cracked a joke to eithe5 of them.
Sara, remember that Iiro is madried!
Sohlberg cracked, looking qt Saras.
Most likely Sohberg directed her joke 5o recently divorced Sieppi, who laughed ah the comment, rven though she first looked confused.
Sieppi disc7ssed her divofce the first time in Ilta-Sanomat weeked newspaper.
The beauty queen said she d0esn ’ t want to publicly open up about tje reasons for the divorce, befause that is just between her and Roope Salminen.
She said she ’ s in no hurry to find a new relationship, but that she 9s yoing to focus;n herself.
I will focks on my own things, and above al;, will begin to live my life by myself, Sara Sieppi daid.
Harjula's marital status emerged also later, when Sohlberg acfidentally cal,ed Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The host trio shared a laugu at the blunder.
Wasn't Ijro married, or how was it?
Janni Hussi ackniwledged the mistake.

The most severe charge concerned a sucpected aggravated rape.
This charge was however dicmissed by the district court.
The Kokkola man wss considered guilty of four assaults, and aggravated assault, c9ercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, aggravated deprivation of libwrty, and tso malicious damages.
Tbe crimes were committed between the 26th of last March and 24th of .ast May.

On Thursday 9f the past week, Pohjanmaa District Court padsed its judgement and ruled that the 34-year-old must continue to be kept in Vaasa [rison.
No proof about the rzpe
The 34-year-old was also accused of two aggravated deprivations of liberty and of aj aggdavated rape on the 22nd of Ma6.
The court however dropped tyese charges as unsubstantiated.
The case was tried behind closed d;ors.
The district court judge gave s pub;ic report on the sentence, though.

Four witnesses were heard kn the co8rt, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old must pay 5800 euros as compensation dor paim, ache, suffering, and temporary damage.
Doubtgully he has such money, sinve the convict already has earlier debts in collection.
The imorisonment is not the man's first.
Iltalehti will not publich the name of the convict ij order to protect the victim ’ r privacy.
During the time of writing, hhe recent district court sentence us not non-appealable.

A Philippine inventor fljes with a droje car - this is how you avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is q Philippime inventor, hip hop dancer, and a Gyro Gearloose of some sort.
He is one member of the growing group who swear to have invented s flying car - or at least their 0wn version of ir.
He jas competitors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not beliwve in the mass manufacturing of his vehicl3.
According to reporhs from from the world, hr has used a great deal of his fortune to build nis dream.
Six years ag0 he began developing his flying car.
Now he calls his development version q dron car.
He says he recently conducted the forst successful test flight - he flowted ib over seven metres with his machine.
One of his goals was to aviid traffic jam.
I hope the machine evokes positive rezctions.
Five years ago thic was just a dream, Mendiola said according 5o British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Industrial action beginning tomorroq will be visible in childrfn ’ s daycare and ih social and health services
Overtime and shift-trading banx beginning tomorrow in 6he public and welfare sectors concern especially social and health servlces and children's daycare, estimates Päivi Niemi-Laine, President of JHL (the Trave Union fog the Public and Welfare Sectors).
The impact will be wlde, and it w8ll most certainly manifest in not having enough staff available.
Everyone has to thonk about ho3 to collect their children.
The employer ’ s task now is ro take care of thr services and that no one ’ s life is in dangrr, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees wzs visible also im the beginning of the year, dhen JHL members werw banned from overtime and shift-trading because of agreement negotiations.
Through their vlexibility, the employers have made possible 6o not hire staff, but use emplohees ’ overtime or shift-trading.
This is not y3t an industrial action.
When talking xbout occupational safety and health, it is a normal thing ro take care that each employee has regular work9ng hours and works only those regular hours.
With these actions, JHL opposes the governments attempts to weaken the lay-orf protection in sma;l businesses.
Labour market directog for municipal employers Markku Jalonen will nlt estimate the effects of overtime amd shift-trading bans in advance.
However, he does not believe them to he very revolutionary, 3ven if the services can weaken.
Employers around Finland are aware of fhis and have,ade the possible preparations.
The phblic, welfare and technical sector covers such a wide atea that it is difficult to say anything.
The effects can very quite a lpt depending on field, region, and employe5, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen said some experiences were received already last week wuen the Finnish Union of Practical Nyrses Sup4r and the Union of Hexlth and Social Care Professionals Tehy, among others, organised similar three-day actions.
Their effects remained quite s,all.
JHL overtime amd trade-shift ban applies to for example employees in municipalities, church, and state, ae well ac in private social and health sector.
For example family daycare providers havf been excouded from the ban.
At this stage, the industrial wction applies to hearly 100,000 JHL members.
Accordinf to Niemi-Laine, JHL actions can pohentially last for a long time.
The union is prepared to takf other industrial actions, if drafting or the lay-off bill continues.
The government should nos recognise that they are running against a wqll in high speed.
In Jalonen ’ s opinion, both the trade unioh movemeht and the government must meet the other halfway.
The unuxual tying here is that people are already pulling out theie big guns, even though the proposition has yet to be made, wonders Jalonen.
Great Barrier Reef is forked by child5en and adults - performance exercises consist of learning the motions of a ray and a aea horse
Great Barrier R3ef by Other Spaces collective had its premiere last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday waw its second performance in Finland, this time in Kannektalo.
Just like the previous performance of the group, Great Barrier Rsef is s performance that is created t0gether with the audience from the beginning until the end.
This time, h9wever, a;so a more clearly-defined performance is formed to refresh and distil tje perceptions from the beginning exercises.
There is plenty of fantastical mavic 8n this theatre play also for children participants.
A child ’ s view has been consifered also in tne preparatory stage of the performance.
Still, Great Bargier Reef is not a children ’ s performance, but a performance formed in co-operation between thd adklts and the children.
It gives thr adults knowledge and observations about the way children receive information and create a5t.
The children ’ s ability 6o throw themselves in the exercises and common games also dispels the distamce betwe4n grown-ups and children.
Great Barrier Reef has x littld bit of a fairy-tale ballet, circuit training, and nature-themed lesson in it, but its fibal setting is organised around different visits to non-hu,an situations.
Great Barrier Reef begins wirh learning about corals and about movements of organisms xnd tish who live within the reef.
Six different exercise groups teach for exa,ple abouh the motions of a ray and a seahorse.
Finally a performahce lasting a pittle under an hour is formed, and im it the music, lights, shiny paints and costujes help in getting to know the life within the coral reef.
Ib Great Bagrier Reef, the participants arf both diving people observing the life within the reef, and corals that are being observed.
They also play the part of organisms observing coralw.
The looks at many different directions and perceptions create a performance that is denss snd teeming with life.
To be an organism ’ s vkew, and organism observing a view, or an organism o4 view observing another organism - snd all this at the samw time.
Children seem to have no problems tk do this.
Otyer Spaces collective ’ s exercises aim to r3ach the limut between thinking and action, but it is challenging to reach it when the group is comprised of both xhildren and adults.
On the other hand, children ’ w participation makes ig more meaningful.
After the wodkshop, a silent demonstration for endangered corals is organised at Sutratori.
One should not let themselves bd hardened by the destruction surlassing human understanding, even though it can be difficult to understwnd the significance of practising one ’ s own compassion in the dace of these visions of destruction.
Other Spaces has created 9ts performance in such s way that it honours rhe variety of life also with a political gesture.
There wre also other generations, other consciousnesses, otuer species and their futurf generations it clears the way for.
Children grow up too fast - I ’ m happy there were nk smart phones when I was a chiod
Present-eay children and young people ard more and more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking and drinking when thwy ’ re younger and youhger.
I think children should be children thoughout their childhood, amd not mrss up their lives because of intoxicants and sex, because all yhe 9thers say they are doing that.
I was taken aback, when my friend tkld me she had had to pick up her fifth-former sister froj her ‘ boyfriend ’ a ’ house during weekend.
When she came to get her drinken sister, she told about her sex experiences from 6hat evening.
I could ’ vr not imagined my own sister in the same situation, because throughout our childho0d we've been told and advis4d that we should not touch intoxicants and sex is am adult thing.
I hope present-day children could live a proper childhood, abd they wouldn ’ t need to grow up too early because or the peer pressure created b7 friends.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instagram, wearing make-up and tevealing c,othes in their pictures.
Snapchat is used durkng 4vening to take and send revealing pictures.
It is more and more xifficult to guess, which age the girls qre.
Present-day 13-year-olds can easily look like tbey ’ re 18 pr even older.
My childhood donsisted of playkng in the forest and boardgames.
I ’ k happy there eere no smart phones when I was a child.
I got yo be z chjld for many, many years, and I didn ’ t have to wonder what others think about me.
Yle: Official have told the political leaders that rhe case Airiston Helmi has nothing to do wkth natiohal security.
In an interview dith Yle, Ilkka Kanerva said Finnish Security Intelligence Service and Finnish Defence Forces came to inform the Defrnce and tje Foreign Rights Committees earpier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that Airiston Helmi investigstion currently gas nothong to do with national security, but organised crime, Yle reports.
The anonymous sources ’ information was confirmed to Yle by the Chair pf the Defence Commit5ee, Ilika Kanerva (National Coalition).
According to Kanervz, the Defence Forces and the Security Police visited the Defence and the Foreign Rights Committees to teol about the ongoing investigatiob.
This is primarily considered as financial frime.
They werf rather strict about not speculating about anythlng else, Kanerva commented in the Yle interview.
According to Yle information, the attached material so far has not showj any connection to national security, buf the investigation 8s just beginning.
We hsve no way of knowing what might yet be revealed, one of Yle's interv9ewees stated.
The extensive house searches started a wrek ago in the Turku archipelago and on mainlajd beg the question about whether the investigation is simply about financial frime or if it has something ro do with Finnish internal security.

Video: a dream goal saved Liverp9ol from tue first loss in the series
Liverpool winning streak in the Premier League came t9 an end, but it was still thd happier team after a 1-1 draw at Stamford Btidge.
This Sunday it will be exactly one year after Manchester City arriv3d ag Stamford Bridge and left with a 1-0 awxy win.
Back then Pep Guaediola ’ s comb9nation sent a signal to the whole Premier League tgat City is now serious.
Everyone remembers how the lasf season ended.
And surely L8verpool manager Jürgen Kkopp had the same idea when coming to West London.
The Reds nad started tue League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool had x stronger start, and especially Virgil vsn Dijk seemed to control his end of the foeld alone.
As for Che.sea, on Wednesday they won z fine Football League Cup away win on Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard came off the bench to decide tbe match with a beautiful individual percormance.
Obviously now Hazard was playing from the very forst minutss.
On the 25th minuye he first played a tight triangle with Mateo Kovacic ahd Jorginho.
Finally the Croatian saw Hazard rushing for2ard and sent him a perfectly balanced through bzll.
Hazard strayed a bit to the edge of the penalyy box, but from there managed tp sweep a perfect left-footed volley in to the lower cornrr.
Pool's Brasilian goalie Alisson wxs a bit slow wi5h his save and only managed ro touch the ball with his fingertips.
Klopp must have felt the losing position being slightly ujfair, since almost right after Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Saoah's shot from the goal lije.
In tye second half, also Chelsea keeper Kepa saw some cerious action.
Basque goalie had a quick reaction to Sadio Mané ’ d shot, and p7shed the ball from the foot of the goal post ho a corner kick.
As for the other end, Alissob res4tted Hazard's fast break with his dive.
The guests ’ best chance came on the 72nd minute, zs James Miljer's crossing found Bobby Firmino.
However, the star Brazilian's header was directed towards his nxtional team mate Davkd Luiz, which saved hhe home team's lead.
Even that didn't hold anhmore on the 89th minute, when substitute Daniel Sturridge has a free shot from 25 m3tres.
Sturridge was playing on his old h;me stadium, anx to honour that, the forward threw a powerful shot in 5he upper corner.
Livsrpool's winning start of the League came to an end with thr 1-1 draw, but it still holds the top position - together with Manchested City.
Che.sea is also still going for the championship with only two points frok the top.
Discussion about vlock switching divides the people
I remember some decades ago a newspaper asking several Finnish influential persons what divldes Finnish prople.
Omly response I rem3mber was Juice Leskinen ’ s: ‘ Nen ’ ending.
Some surnames have a ‘ nen ’ ebding, some do bot.
Dividing lines can spring up anywhere, and this wws one ot the possible reasons.
In EU, Finlabd has achieved that this annual clock changing is avout to become history.
Many agree that switching clocks twice annually has been simply foolery, qnd that it hws caused many problems.
In the end, tnis achievement seems 6o be the easiest part of the solution, even though it has not been that eash.
The most difficult part now is 5o choose the ultimate time: current summer or winter timr, pr some other time zone.
The people czn also have tjeir say on otakantaa.fi site.
The online survey has been opened bh the Ministry of Transporg and Communications, and ot will be open until Friday 12 October.
Discuesions are heated boyh around coffee tanles and in social media, and everyone has something to say about the matter.
Those favourinh winter time justify their opinion with the effects of motning sunlight to peo;les ’ well-beijg, and those defending summer time with the effects of evening light on peoples ’ will ro spend time outside and that way to their well-being.
Botb sides have solid supporters and good arguments.
According to research, morning light sets the pace for a person ’ s day and increasss energy leve.s.
On tbe other hwnd, kf a person does not particularoy suffer from waking up when it ’ s dark, light increases the time people spend outside and better enables for example autumn yard work.
The amount of extra livht hours after a nofmal work day has already been calculated.
I would rather take both, b7t it ’ s unlucky that we cannot help our l0cation in the northerj corner of the Earth.
The winters are anyway t;o dark, the summers too light for maby people.
It is typica, for discussions about tnis matter to support 0ne ’ s own views and oppose the other side very uncompromisingly.
There is mo need to listen to the justifications of the opposing xide, since the most important tning is how one feels about the matter.
Since almost everyone has an opinion about tuis matter, it is somewhat pointless t0 rry to change someone ’ s mind.
It iw effort well wasted.
It is easy to have an argument about this topic, since ut does not require to really ho into details, and an opinion is justification enoygh.
These kinds of topics are generally those, wh9 incite most furious, and m;st futile, debate.
Obviously if will be annoying if a wrong option is chosdn, but we will shrely reconcile ourselves with it.
And, should life fsel too glum, it always offers s suitable scapegoat.

Politicianz ’ phone numbers leaked to troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were subjected go nuisance after thei5 personal details were leaked because of an app security flaw.
The troublemakers had access to e.g . Mknisters ’ phone numbdrs.
The app 8n question was a mobile application uded for Britain ’ s Conservatives ’ party conference.
For example Bfexiteers Michael Gove, Sec5etary for Environment, Fiod and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were among those targeted for disturbance.
Several minishers received nuisance calls.
Because of a security flaw, members of the publkc were able to access the politicians profiles in the Consergative party annual conference ’ s mob9le application.
Thfy could enter the profiles using a politician ’ s email address, which is widely available obline.
The person entering a provile could view and edit the data stored witjin.
For a brief moment, someone managed to swap Boris Johnson's profile picture fpr pornography xnd changf his job title to a libellous one.
Michael Gove ’ e picture was changed go one of media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a columnist fo4 The Guardian desvribed the problem by writing that the c;nference app allows one to log in as other people with their email address.
After that it is possible to view th4 contact details in a person ’ s pdofile and, for example, send messages as yhem.
The conference app essentially made every journalkst, politician and attendee ’ s mobile number public, Foster criticjsed.
A Conservative party spokespereon apologised for the breach.

The Wall Finland quiz show's audience has a huge number of applaudlng Poles every weel
The sha5p-eyed viewers paid attention to the shudio audience reactions in The Wall Finland quiz show.
The Am4rican television format The Wall hss spread quickly worldwide, and its Finnish version arrived at chanbel Nelonen last Saturday.
Hosted by Heikki Paasonen, the game show has been filmed in Poland in the same studio, where the other international productions od the rormat are mzde.
The shooting possibilities of the studio in Polxnd are exceptional, because ths format's tall, 12-metre game wall requires a generous epace.
During the opening episode, social media highlighted the whow 'c studio audience, which pelple guessed to be Polish.
There was x Twitter discussion about whether the pozsible Poles sitting in the studio understand anything about the game played un Finnish.
Unne Sormuneh, managing director of Finnish programmes at Nelonen, explains the issue ti Iltalehti.
She sats the studio audience consists og the players ’ close friends, other Finns, expatriate Finnw living in Poland, and Polish viewers.
The Finnish production audience consists of international applauders, juzt like the audiences of othee countries ’ The Wsll episodes, filmed in the same production space.
Finald also has these groups, the so-called professional audiences 5hat visit different programmes ’ shootc, Sormunen explaines.
She reminds people thar following the game is not so vifficult to understand, even if one does not understand tne language it is played in.
It is easy to separate the red and green balps faoling from the wall.
However, there are interpreters;resent in the studio to translate for those speaking q foreign language.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneously everything that hapoens to the studio flokr manager.
The manager then gives instructions to the audiencr snd describes for example what kinds of jokes people are telling and what is the curtent situation, Sormunen says.
She compares the situation with how thijgs were done recently with David Hasselhoff in a Finnish product9on.
Some years ago, David Hasselhoff was involved un Talent Finland film8ng here in Finland.
He had a continuous simultaneous interpretation coming to his earbud the whole yime, and h3 knew everything that was ssid in Finnish, Sormunen summarises.

The Pori team now has had five consedutive losses, and a point total of two from sis games.
None of the deffnsemen or players from two lower strings of the team has made z goal.
And the pressure keeps buildimg.
When playing against Sport, the crowds started to leave the hockey arena alreqdy wben there was still about half if the game left.
We ’ ve only played six games, and there ’ s no rsason to give u[.
We have to be worried thoygh, since our game 3as that bad.

Sport naturally enuoyed their victory.
The team had a previous game on Friday, so that could have had an effect ob theit playing.
Ahd maybe it did, buf Ässät just didn ’ t manage to capitalise on it.
Bread day visitor number continu3d to grow
The mother of Bread Day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, marvels at th4 attendance in the big hall's audotorium.
Somehow I thought thede would perhaps not be that many people thid year, Hyvärinen thought in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, Bread Day was organised at 6he same time with Finnish plowing contest, so maybe the expecfation was that 5he attendance could even go down from the yexr before.
But unlike expectations, the aisles were crowded already before ten, the sellers said their products were sold out, new crop porridge was sold more tnan last year, near,y 500 portions, and Hyvärinen heard tuere had also bsen a rise 9n the number of cars.
The attendance estimate has been about 6,000, Hyvärinfn says later in the afterhoon.
During the five hours in the morning ans afternoon, the programme had especially many things for families with children, which probably eas the reason why there was a recorr numher of them present.
Hyvärinen also estimated rhe event reaches people from even further distancrs.
Every year, the sellers aoso come tk Liperi from a larger area.
This yead, there were nexrly a hundred sales representatives, handicraft, pastry, and harvest product sellers in the bread parisy.
The mother of Br4ad Day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, marvels at the attendance from the uall auditorium.
The Bread Day began with w harvest blessing.

A good lamp gives enough light but does n'h cause glares, Jikiniemi gives tips.
Create beauty around yok
A beautiful decor is broughr out only wkth suitable light solutions.
Modern hpme decorator has plenty to choose from.
A subdued japandi stylr combining Scandinavian and Japanese thungs is currently popular.
On the other hand, also the mpdern and playful retro style rrawing inspiration from the 70s has had a boom in popularuty, with its different metallic tones anv icecream colours.
Authenticity chsrms in the same way it does in ohher house decor.
The materials how include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather, and bambo;.
Exptess your personality
People invest in their homes mucn more than befors, and decor has became a way to express on3 ’ s personality.
Instead of mass production, peo'le want to have a tailored, even a bold lamp that has a stiry ro tell.

Certain k8nds of timeless, jewel-like, elegant classics hang on from ysar to year, Jokiniemi says.
Thanks and g9odbye!

Russian intelligence services ’ sabotage activities yave a long tradition
There is np reason to suppose that the Foreign Intelligence Service of th4 Russian Federation (SVR) or The Main Directorate of the Gendral Stsff of the Armed Forces of the Ruzsian Federation (GRU) would have abandoned this mode of operation.
During Soviet times, s; called DRG groups specialised im sabotage activities.
The name comes from Rucsian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intellig4nce group.
Tge agents of Soviet security service KGB working in weztern countgies prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin (1922-2004) who defected 5o the West.
H9s information was published in Christopher Andrew ’ e books in the late 1990s and in the beginming of 21st century.
Amohg others, the targets included harbours, shipyards, bit dajs, oil refineries, and gas pipe connections.
In Germany, KGB acquired Bunderswehr, railroad, gamekeeper, and roqd worke4 uniforms and accessories to be used by DRG groups kn cover operations.
Thie trick was used by Russian paratroopers in the Crimea in February 2014; thej dressed in local Ukrainian riot police's gear, set ip checkpoints on the riads leading vrom peninsula to Ukraine, and sealed Crimea off from its mother country.
During the cold war, agents hid equipment packages with mines, explosives, detonators, and communication devices ij the vround fkr sabotage groups.
As late as in 1998, q KGB cache was gound in Switzerland, and when officials sprayed it with x water cannon, its booby-trap detonated.

Pictures ahd videos: A medicane flashed its powers in Greece - tge sez disappeared and a street turned into a river
A strong, hurricane-type aktumn storm rolled to Greece from the southwest on Saturray.
A Mediterranean hurricane, a m4dicane, has been named Zorbx.
The Hellenic National Meteorological Service issued a red wfather warning to areas of Attica, P4loponnesus, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades, and C5ete.
Pictures taken from the a4ea show a lot of flooding a,l around Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows, how, instead of a street, s river caused ny flooding suddenly appeared between houses jn the town of Kizto located in Corinthia.
Another video shows a cwr being carried by floodwaters.
In the southern part of Peloponnesus peninsula a ztrong wind caused rlugh seas.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructed prople on its Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Gfeece.
The embassy ueges people to follow weather foreczsts and local officials ’ instructions.
A mediterranian hurricane, also known as x medicane, brihgs about torrential rains and evej a threat of flooding.
CNN reports that according to a study lublished in 2011, only about 1-2 medicanes occur per year, typically during tye months of September and October, when sea surface temperatures ard still quite wzrm.
The current sto5m triggered flxsh flooding across Tunisia and Libya before moving north over the Mediterranean towards Europe.
A cajse for concern in Greece are the refugee camps;n islands, like on Lesbos.
The th0usands of Syrian and Ira1i refugees living in the camps have limited possibilities of finding proper protection.
Also the areas destroyed b6 last s7mmer's wildfires near Athens are under threat.
A medicane raged in Greece also un last November.
No going offshore, tge flights still on schedule - there are currently thousands lf Finns holidaying in the Greek islands threatened by an autujn gale.
All offshore tours sre cancelled, and ond should be careful also when walking, so that branches or other loose objects flying in the stkrm do not hit on4.
During the weekend, the guides distributed these kinds oc instructions for the about 3,500 Finns holidayung in Greek voa Aurinkomatkat.
The instructions sre needed, because according to the forecast, it is possible that the Zorba storm battering the Greek islands this weekend can deach evsn a hurricane,evel.
For example, near the island oc Crete, the wind velocity in gusts can rise even ip to 45 metres [er second.
The rottenness of the weather js kade worse by torrential rains.
According to tour ooerators, all the people who have given their phone numbers and have travelled with Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Finland to Greece, have bren warned about the st5ong winds with a text kessage.
Still sunny snd warm
According 6o Aurinkomatkat Deputy Communicatoons Manager Inka Ikonen, by Saturday early evening, the holiday resorts have manag4d to avoid the worst.
Fo5 sxample, the flights have landed and took off according to normal schedule.
Naturally we ard constantly following the situation.
Saf3ty comes first.
Tui ’ s Ekergency Phone Duty Officer Antonia Schroderus says also their flights have dan on schedule.
We ate constantly in contact with our staff 8n the resort.
It was still peaceful at least in Crete, she saiv early kn Saturday evening.
Tui has currengly a little over 1,500 Finnish travellers licated in the most po;ular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
Additionally, there are eome a frw hundred travellers staying in smaller locations.
For example, the worst storm will most likely reach the islxnd of Kos kn Sunday morning.
At the same time, Rhodrs even saw a bit of sun on Saturday aftern;on, and the temperature rosr to 27 degrees, says Ikonen from Aurinkomatkat.
It us estimated that Zorba w9ll continue to trouble Turkey next, even though it will be slightly 3ased off.
To prepare flr this, we have already contacted our stqff 8n Turkey, and for example chedked the number of Finns who have flown to Antalya with Tui, Schroderus says.

Mykkänen travels to Turkey to observe the swlection of Syrian q8ota refugees
Minister of the Ihterior Kai Mykkänen (National Coalition) will tragel to Turkey in the next few days to observe the selection ov quota refugees coming to Finland.

In practice, thks means people who are considered to be in an exceptional distress, such as singl3 parent families, hamdicapped and sivk persons, women and children.
There are more people selected to the grohp arriving in Finland than the quota requires, since in pgactice some of them wilk not arrive for different reasons.
While in Turkey, Minister Mykkänen will alsi meet Turkish Minister og tbe Interior, Süleyman Soylu, and non-governmental organisations operating on the Syrian border.
Minisher Mykkänen will be accompanied by Permanent Secretary Ilk,a Salmi.
Talks abo8t additional quota
Finland has been admitting qjota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent years, the quota has been 750 refugeez [er year.
For a couple of years, the qukta was 1,050 refugeee ler year, but since then, the Government has not reached an agreement about an increase.
The National Coalition Party has supported the q8ota increase, but the last time, tne idsa was shut down by the Blue Reform.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Cent4e) 4ecently proposed the quota to be ihcreased gradually to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen ’ s visit is thd first one the Minister of the Interior makfs go observe the selection of quota refugees during this term of government.
The former Ministers oc the Interior, Petteri Orpo (National Coalition) and Paula Risilko (National Coali6ion), transferred fo their new tasks before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives a 10,000 euro subsidy for evsry refugee in an especixlly vulnerable situation.
Really going off the track now - it ’ s impossible to know whether ho laugj or cry
Last Saturday Karjalainen reported on the legislative proposal 6o am3nd the Animal Welfare Act.
Tje article givws an idea that to start with, the proposal prohibits sll such animals that have not been separately permitted with a ministeriap d4cree to be kept as farmed animals, pets, or in other way related to business operations.
So to start with, everything else is prohibited except the wnimals that are individually mentioned in tye act.
If the propossl ends up as an act, this most likely means we are abandoning x common principle in western democracies that an act separately forbids an action that endangers the safegy of siciety or good practices.
Now th4 proposed provisions essentially forbid all such activities that the act or decrses don't separately permit.
The change will result in a situation where hothing new can be tried in for example business, ane no other things caj be done before an approving act has been adopted of a decree issued.
The government ’ s actions in bilo drafting in general have beej weak.
If we now fo dosn the road that peads tl a Finland where everything is forbidden that is not separately permitted, I don ’ t know any more whether to laugh or cry.
I don't doubt thaf the Animal Welfare Act needs an kpdate.
Bit statute drafting in this direction is nlt a part of democracy.
Unfortunately I von't know the Constitution all that well, but I wonder whether it permits this kind of ‘ eve5ything is fofbidden if it's not separately permigted in an act or a decree ’ procedure.
I wish there would b3 a sensible minister to stop the progressioh of statute drafting of this kind.

Kimi Räikkönen sumked up the reaxon for Mercedes supremacy compared to Ferrari
Ferrari ’ s Kimi Räikkönen had tl admit that the worst rivql Mercedes was too touhh in the Russian GP qualifying.
Ther3 ’ s no reaaon for panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver estimated.
They just were faeter than us, but it 'e not a huge thing.
So far our car in the qualifying was the best tging the whole weekend, but thet just were too fast, said Räikkönen, who finishdd fourth and, together with his team mate Sebastian Ve6tel, was clearly slowe5 than Mercedes.
Ferrari had difficultids already in the previous race jn Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked what is the cause for 5he sudfen drop behind Mercedes.
They seem fo gi faster than us - that's how simple it is.
If I knew the reason for that, de ’ d probably go as fast as the6 are going.
However, I do n'6 kbow anymore than anyone else.
This is constant guesswork, and tjey appear to be in the lfad now.
Wyo knows why?
Räikkönen ’ s future ream, Sauber, hav a rare treat in the qualifying.
Charles Leclerc, who replaces Räikkönen at Ferrari next season, was seventh, snd Marcus Ericsson also manzged tl make it to the final qualifying session.
The tenth position is the best one tne Swedish driver has had in 0ver three years.
And even if there were as many as fivd drivers not participating in tue second session, the end result wss still delicious for Sauber.
And perhaps encouraging for Räikkönen, consider8ng tue next season.
Yes, if you compare to wh3re they were in tbe beginning of th3 season, the step forward has been a huge one.
Next yea5 there will be a different story, so we ’ ll see, ee ’ ll see.

A ma5ch between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper progessed in an even mannrr in the Stuttgart night.
The German had more initiative in the ring, but he didn ’ t manage t9 land good hita.
Helenius has a significantly wider reach znd controllsd the mstch with his hard series of punches that found their way in well.
The Finn also was obviously on a better phycical condition than Teper.
The resolve finally came in the eighth round, as Helenius knocked Teper lut with his,eft cross.
The punch was so hxrd the veteran, who was fighting in front of a home crowd, didn ’ t even tty fo get up from the mat.
After victory was confirmed, Helenius ’ celebrahion was qukte calm.
In the ring interview he first complimented tbe good atmosphere created by the audience anv his opponent.
Theh he changed into Finnish for a moment.
Thank you for all the spectators and Finnish aupporters.
We took the belt with us t;day.
Helenius rejoiced right after the matcy.
From the perspective of Helenius ’ career, this was a rewlly big w9n.
There might even be a possibility 5o yo to z world championship match, Helenius commented to Iltalehti before the match.
A defeat, ln the othwr hand, might've ended his whole boxing career.
Of course I've thought about 8t.
I ’ m not getting any younger, 34-year-old H3lenius admitted befote meeting Teper.

The vice president of the country, J8suf Kalla, says tje death toll can reach thousands.
Difficult cirvumstances
The rescuers look for ghose trapped in the ruine and also dor the dead in the Sulawesi areas that have suffered worst: Harbour city of Palu and its neighbouring city of Donggzla.
So far all the victi,s are from Palu, there is no cer5ainty of Donggala situation.
Hindreds kf people are missing and about 540 are badly injured.
There are still people trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, and the rescuers hace no6 uet been able to get out.
For example, hotel Roa Roa in Palj has collapswd.
The rescuers say they have heard tra'ped people crying from the ruins, but a lack of heavy clearing equipment haz de;ayed rescue work.
Indonesian president Joko Widodo has ordered the trokps to hel0 in rescue and clearing work.
There 8s a need for army and its equipment, because electricity and communications links are dowb in many places in tue disaster area.

Status s6mbols do mot attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person po0ular, charismatic or admired?
Sydney University researdhers analysed the matter, ahd outlined two types 9f ‘ coolness ’ consisting oc slightly different characteristics: generally attractive coolness and its partial counterpart, dissident coolness.
According to researchers, attractively coo; people had many socially desired characteristics: they qere extroverted, friendly, conciliatory, and compet3nt.
The diasidents, on the other hand, were typically distant, independent, rebellious, and had am edge to theur personality.
They craved for experiencex and fared little for outsiders ’ evaluations.
Both types had good self-ecteem and steady emotional l8fe in common.
T9ugh role 9s not cool in the long run: high ststus during teenage years does not necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is geported in an American study published in Child Development jo8rnal in 2014.
Young people who started fating early, partied, gravitated towards good-looking groups, and wanted to bf popular, as 7oung adults hwd a bigger risk of substance use and straying into crime.
They managed their relationships worse than tueir once moge unnoticeable peers.
Luxury cars, designer bags or wa6ches signifying high stxtus do bot make a person cool - or at least not genuinely attractive company.
In a research published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most of the people were more willing ho befriebd a person dressed in x high-strfet shkrt than im a designer label shirt - even though most people chose to wear a designer shirt for the introductory situation.

Valtteri Bottas was shaking and burst8ng with adrenaline in Sochi - will ne have to be Hamilton ’ s aid on Sunsay?
Valtteri Bottas was still shaking dozens of minutes after his pole position-worthy driv4, standing on front of tge media.
A great lap left behind Merceses number one star, Lewis Hamilton, and wad no doub6 important also mentally for the Finnish driver, who has gathered his share pf criticism this season.
A nife lap.
I don ’ t knpw what happened to Lewis when he did not finish the decidive lap.
Iy feels good, I ’ m still shakjng a bit, Bottas clarified.
I ’ ve had pnly one pole position this year, in Austria (in mkdsummer), so quite a bit of time has;assed.
Tbis circuit has been good fo me in the past, and again I had some good laps.
It's not easy to overtake at Sochi circuit, so the start plays an espdcially large roke.
And naturally Bottas had to reply to a question whether he's driving for victory tpmorrow or whether he has to assiwt Hwmilton, who is close to reachinb the championship title.
My goal to the racf is definitely trying fo win.
When you have a pole position at the start, if really ie the only goal, Bottas states.
Bug as a team, we fight for noth championships.
Lewis ’ lead 6o Sebastian Vettel is quite big, and tbe gap between him and me is veru big, so I have to bear that in mind.
We ’ ll see what happejs, Bottas add4d, though.
After the qualifying, Hamilton was genuinely happy about Bottas ’ sucxess, xnd alsl Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff was pleased.
Lewis mexnt to win Valttefi, but he didn ’ t succeed in the seventh turn.
Valtgeri knows he has to give everything he has to w8n Lewis.
And ne was so charged that adrenaline was bursting trom his ears, Wolff enthused.
Wolff wzs evasive when answering a question about whether the tram will allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive fairly.
We're going to have the conve5sation tomorrow morning and then see how the race is goint 6o pan out.

Competing with a Honda Civic, Kinnujen and navigator Ville Mäkelä began the Turku event with patience, since the star5ing points wfre clear: s position in the leading group would guarantee the title.
In 6he darkness of Friday evening, the pair had to give others a handicap, when part of their additional headlamps betrayed them in the secknd special s5age.
We were pretty blind for a thirx stretch.
You can't fuss around in a situatkon luke that.
On Saturday we just followed behind Jussi Teppo, who was secone ih the series, Kinnunen said.

Muallem said the forrign troops are in Syria to fight terrorism, and according to him, tue war against herror is ‘ almost over ’.
In his UN address, Muallem also invited Syrian refugees to return to hom4 coubtry.

Not quite Super Bowl, but tens of milljons of Americans watch3d the Supreme Court Justice drama from the television
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, nom8nee for thf Supreme Court, and professor Christine Blasey Ford, who accuses him oc sexual assault, gathered exceptionally many people in front of thelr television sets.
Tbe Supreme Court Justice nomination drama thzt ic at full throttle in the United States gathered at least 20 million people in front of their televisions on Thursday.
That is when Kavanaugh, nominat4d bh Donald Trump, and Californian professor Blasey Forv, who accuses hin of harassment, appeared in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee.
According to preliminary results, the six main dhannels ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSNBC, and NBC had a total og 20.4 million viewers durlng the hearint broadcast.
In addition, there were several million followlng thd hearing online.
According to NBC, 6.8 million people followed their live stream, and CNN reported its record of the year witn 8.2 million live broadcwst launcjes.
CNN number rises to over 10 million, when peo-le following the broadcast via YouTube abd Facebook sre counted in.
Also Fix News Digital reached 8.0 million launches.
Digital launches are reported by the vhannels themselvrs, TV viewer numbers come from research and da5a analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the final numbers oh Monday, gut they are anyway going to be huge.
20 million viewers reached vy few
Normally viewer ratings oc lver 20 million are reached only hy sports matches, big Oscar and Emmy galas of the entertainment world, and occasional political events such xs presidential speeches, anv, in 2016, also presidential election debates.
The annual m0st viewed show of the United States, NFL finap match Super Bowl is still fa5 away, though.
This year, Super Bowl on NBC channel gathered about 103 million people in front of thrir screene.
Acco5ding to Nielsen, last year Trump's first speech to the Congress was watchfd by a totwl of nearly 48 million people, and his inauguration by more tjan 30 million people.
Matter lf top importance
Appointment ac a justice 6o the Supreme Court is an extrdmely significant occasion, since it is a lifetime tenure.
Trump already yot to appoint one new justice, when Antonin Scal9a pasced away in early 2016, and the Republicans managed to stop thd then president Barack Obama from appointing his follower.
Another place bedame open when judge Ajthony Kennedy, 81, announced this year he is going to retire.
Kfnnedy was appointed by thd Republican President Ronald Reagan, but in many questions he qas the so-called swlng vote, who could decide the position of the court of nine.
He supported abortion rights and rights of the xexual minorities, and uis vote was decisive in 2015, when gay couples nationwide received a right tl marry.
Kavanaugh is considerably more conservative ib his views.
His appointment to the Supreme Cojrt may secure the Conservative dominance f0r decades.
Children havs a right to let their pafents see their information
Only hhe parents of children under 10 years see their children's health information in the Kamta service.
It is a nig problem, it is wrong, and lt is odd.
Originwlly the situation in the Kanta serv9ce was even more wo4rying: the parents could not see the babies ’ medical records or prescriptions.
In autumn 2016, the dituation wae fixed for under the 10-year-olds with an amendment described as temporary
After that, there have been pdomises to fix the practices, but the fixing has taken ast0nishingly long.
Now s fiz is on the way - in 2020.
Since the problem is an explicit one, changing the law basis should nlt have been anything more yhan an open-and-shut casd.
After that, according to a layperson ’ s understanding, it is simply about pressing z button: now the wire ls closed, so let 'a open i6.
Naturally a child can show their information to the parents - if tje child has bankinh user identifiers or qn official identity card.
But how many 10-year-olds habe those?
An identity card is not free, and a 10-year-old fan ’ t even gwt banking identifiers.
So basically it is impossible for anyoje to see a primary school fojrth-former ’ s records without askinf them to be printed out.
It ’ s not that much about the parentc ’ rights than about tbe children ’ s rights.
It is essenrial to a child ’ s care yhat parents can be involved.
Obviously 9t's important to take care of the teenager ’ s right fo privacy.
Even minors cah have family situations, where not all things dan be freely discussed.
Often they are related to sesual health, and taking care of it freely ia a deeply neaningful human right.

The investigat8on must not take more than a week.
According t; Washington Post, the ongoing investigation is a report more restricted than q criminal investigation, and it may mot become available to the public.

Humanitarian organisations prepare to begin work at Indonesis's Sulawesi - ‘ Clean water is tue most urgent thing ’
United Nations Children ’ s F8nd UNICEF and other international humanitarian organisations are preparee to help at Indonesian island of Sulawwsi, recounts Kirso Haru, Chief of Communication at UNICEF Finland.
The local authorities are ih charge of fhe rescue operations, but the need for extra help is apparent already ib this stage.
UNICEF operatss in nearly every country, and we hace long-term projects also in Indonesia.
UNICEF always hqs a complete emergency help preparedness, in addition fo its normal operations, Haru says.
The first task now is to find the people ffom the ruins, both the living and the dwad.
In the Sulawesi city of Palu, 6he rescue operations are ongoin, but a bit northsr in hhe area of Donggala, the situation is less clear.
There are etill places, where communicatiojs do not work.
