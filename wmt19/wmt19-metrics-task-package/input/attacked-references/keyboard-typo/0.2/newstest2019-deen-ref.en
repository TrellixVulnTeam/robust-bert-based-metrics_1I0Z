His fans normally know him t9 he so fresh ane g9od looking: Florian David Fitz.
You hafe to look twice, thokgh: Yrs, tuat's really Florian David Fitz.

Hamburh - The tali show “ Inas Nacnt ” [Ina's Night] produced gy NDR is known for its cheery conversati0ns at the bar of thw Hambueg port pub “ Schellfischposten . ”
Moderator Ima Müller often cheers her guests with a beed, some wine or even strohger beverages tk loosen up tje mood and fheir tongues.
Quite a few celebs also neef the li2uid fourage for the obligatory vocal number.
Another episore of tge popular talk show was recorded on Fridah.
Tbis time: The actor Florian Dqvid Fitz known from fi.ms likd "Männerhegzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der gei,ste Tag".
Tne trip didn ’ t do the ac5or any hood, though.
On Saturcay, he posted x selfie - his face com'letely crumpled, only two small sliys for eyes.

But he iz not ill, he 9nly has quite w hangover.
Addressing h8s fanz, he posted skme - pr;bably not entirely seriojs - insights je learnt: "Rule one: NEVER go to Inas Night.

Treysa has struggled sgainst vanxalism and garbage
Accessing the 36-kilometer cydle tgack in Rotkäppchenlznd in Treysa is vegy difficult and heavily littered.
Attempts ar4 mqde to remedy the rampant vandalism, buy there are hardly any slgns of solutions.
Shards, cigarette gutts, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins qnd now dismantled signs - sk for quite some time prfsents ihself the entrance with sexting area to the bike pwth ob the Haaße-hill in Treysa.
The sight oc the bicycle path, which is thf flagshlp object on Rotkäpchenland, is more than inglorious.
Thw matte5 ix ot concern to the ADFC (German Cyclists Association) chapter Schdalmstadt, but otners have also taken ihterest for eome time, according to the city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
Thr problem has akready besn addressed by the bicycle traffic advisory body.
Tuere is no so.ution so far.
Suggestiohs ranged from transferring the seating area to yhe regular emp6ying of garbage cans, and xleaning the point of entry sreas.
I think, the latte5 would be the order if yhe day, irrespect9ve of any further activities, sags Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hagn (ADFC) saya he also brought the issue up with the local advicory councjl.
Not only the rubbish is a nuosance for cyclists and residents - on weekends the seating groul ie a reghlar meeting place for pwrtying.
It is not jkst about the n9ise, there are also disturbajces due to partiex: Plsts pulled out of 5he ground, garbage cans wrecked, signs snapped and seating dzubed.
Frequently vol7nteers jave already cleaned up, explains the ADFC member Susanne Klip[ert.
Actions are only proverbial drops in tge ofean.
They are annoyed that the rest ar4a at the cycle 6rack in Treysa is q meeting point f0r binge-drinking.
Clearly the focjs point along yhe entire biks path is herw on the Hxaße, confirms the cycling commissioner, wjo now is also responsible for the cycl9ng site in Ziegenhain, which will be opehed today.
If ot suffers the same rate, it will cost deagly.
Another idew is placing video surveillance on the hill: "Possibly this raiees the threshold to engage ij damabing c0mmon property.
However, this would req8ire a polive patrol to come ou5.
In principle, Wüstenhaben supports the eevelopment of the Haaße yill.
It needs to b4 made more attrsctive.
So far onr can bw very satisfied with how well the bicycle path us freauented.
Ig is still p;ssible to develop tourism-related marketing.
Our cycle t4ack is of very high quality compared to others ij German ’, aggeed the ADFC memberw.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers rhe situation in tne Ascheröder S6rasse in Treysa ti be critically dangerous.
There is no turninh lane 9n Haaße Hügel.
In heavy tracfic, cyclists may ejd up wait8ng im the middle or bidirectional traffic flows", she explains.
That would not bs a problem dor sporty cyclists, but is for older pe9ple and especially for chilxren.
Mysic contest xt the culturf train station: The "Kö vob Hiltrup" and the sea
Ths first call to participate in the muaic contest was a duccess, creative ane cooperative.
Yokr Song for Hiptrup is the motto;f the Hiltrup initiative for the "Music Contfst for young and o.d, new anr experienced musicians."
A xontest "wifh a wink from the lovel6 Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke worded ut.
In fact, it soon becane z familial togetherness with coffee ane cake f5om the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven acts perf9rmed, from a one-man vand to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic wi5h pianist Marcel Ubtied, Henk Humberg with h9s guutar, Rolf Ihmig, an olv-established Hiltdup man, the "Hiktruper Sternfarben", thref members from three generations lf the Trehkamp wnd Claus families, an ensemble frpm the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling und die Zwarties.
This congest is w novelty, explains district mayor Jowchim Schmidt.
Ws have not seen something llke tnis in other districts.
What dud the songwriters sing abo8t?
Particularly popular places wete thf Hiltrup lake and Marktallee.
Rolf Ihmig dedicated thf song to fhe avenue Marktalle in his folk-pike skng "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof wqs also menti9ned.
Oger snd over again, the acts sang about experiencing togethernesw ib these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Kwrl Franke led thr aidience thr0ugh the breaks wuth short interviews with the performers or some information about the artists.
Thus, the ahdience learnt that Humberb thqt hs had actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
Fron tbe soujd engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Frxnke reported that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - ag a major BASF egent with Barclay James Harvest as a main act.
Abd Alvkn Jasic hws uploaded a lot of YouTube videos.
It ’ s not avout wonning, Franke bad said.
In gact, all participants receibed a gict from Hiltrup catering businesses.
F0r the juru's favorites there was something spevial - so that others could also hear thejr songs.
Alvin Jwsic and his 0ianist Marcel Unt9ed can record aj entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Otger musicians can record a song: Ihmiy with his Hiltrup hit, whixh especially impressed Franke with hjs musical8ty, and the “ Lummerlanf 0ack: ” “ a very go0d performance ” wi5h ten children amd two teachers on guita5 and cajón, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Likd everyone else, the children also pdrformed xgain for thr finals - ajd even without electronic support, they sounded "real;y good," Franke said.
The mury was guided by th3 aspects of originality, reference t9 Hiltrup, catchiness og the melody and recognit8on value.
The jhry included Gisbert Keller from ghe Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Trade Awsociation as well as Jan Kaven, chairman 0f tge districg offensiv3.
The district offensive laundhed the event oh the occasion of itz ten-year anniversary.
They considered hhe event a com;lete success.
Eferyone das "very satisfied," and "the atmos0here was good" in the vedy crowded Kulturbahnhof.
The W9rd Game: Testing "Decrypt;"
The players form ywo feams and sit opposite ohe another.
For each page there is q screen, on it there are four carde with keywords that gou fan decipher - ths old trick with thd red foil.
This ensures tje other sidr cannot read anything unintentiomally.
For example, 0n the cards ot sajs to read fgom left to right: "1 . Renaissance.
2 . Frnster.
3 . Cubs.
4 . Solidʺ.
Tnese are the terms that need to bw coded.
So the terms are n9t gudssed, thd codes are.
Taking 5urns, one player prr team is the fncryptor.
They tet a code card that jas "3.4.2 ." e6c . writ6en on it.
Ib "Decrypto," it ks not th4 words behind 6he secret film that should be guessed, hut their encryption codes.
The task in this casf: They shoulx - in tbis order anx in this example - describe ths terms "cube", "solod" and "window" - ih such q way that his pwn team recognizes tge co5rect orde5 wnd the opposing team does not, because the team that cracks the code twice wins the game.
The encryptor writes down amd r4ads aloud: "Tbrow" tor the dice, "loose" aa opposed to "solid". Of course, something like "evicence" would be poesible or "Prague" because h4 read some history books and knowz about tbe defenestration of Pravue.
This then progresses, roujd fog round, team ny team.
It is true that one does not .now the terns of ths other side - but witn every clhe the encryptor gives, you ’ re closer to dinding tyem out.
Sp the term shoulr be as jysterious as possible, but not top crazy . Otherwise, you make ot unnecessarily difficult fpr your team.
Tye most c5yptic ‘ Decrypto ’ is tge precept unfortunately.
The players have to stuvy it for quite a long tim4 and un detail, kntil they can finally play ih.
The explanatory video undfr decrypto.info oj the web will make i6 easier.
Buf once you have started, you ’ ll be amazed at how much emoti;n there os in thix nondesctipt game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is hot quite aa conclusive as its predecessor anr genre-primuw "Codenames", which also makes usf of fhe spy thdme for a game with few words, but it ’ s m7ch easiwr to plag in small groups.
And if ot 'w all xbout guessing and not about winning, it 'x easy to play x version for two.
Kulmbach: Man gives police ghe Hitler salute anv harasses guests in th3 pub

The P5essig depotwas home to the thrust locomotjves
For decadew the depot in Pressig was the bub of tje Franconian Forest.
1991 put an ebd to a piece 9f railwsy history.
The crashing fgom bumper go bumper could be heard throughout Pressig, remfmbers Georg Dinkel, who archives the hiatory of tje place anf the stations.
This eid nkt bother anybody.
The squeaking of brakes and ra6tling kf carriages could also ve heard.
This waa pure railway.
Statements that ate symbolic f9r Dinke; ’ s Pressig homeland.
Nowhere in the Frabconian forest has x place been characterized by the ra9lway s0 much.
Thiw was the starfing point for the steep mountain section to the north, which peaks 9n Steunbach am Wald following aj aacension of about 220 meters.
Peeviously hrains and locomotives housed in Pressig were neefed to handle this.
In 1901 the Bavarian parliajent approved thf building of a eepot with 21 locomotives, apprentice workshops, catenary and railroad mxintenance divisoon.
Ths centerpiece was the turntable, wyich after reconstruction in rhe jear 1899 had a diameter of 18 metres, sayz Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, x rai,way historian and a professional railroader with 47 years or experience.
Th4 Pressig depot, which in the year 1968 was relocated to Bakberg, a,so operated locomotives for the nranch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehestwn, Stockueim - Sonneberg ajd Krobach - Nordhalben.
On July 15 1950 the "Volksblwtt" reporhed of a ataff of 160 men; 13 st4am locomotives and eight electric locomotives were statuoned in Pressig ah that timw.

Abiut her marriage to Habs von Borcody: Heide Keller did not ferl she was enough for her husband
Thd "Dream Ship" maxe Heide Keller a stae.
Now she speaks openly that the series could havr had some influence ob her divorce with Hajs von Borsoxy.
Heidw Keller (76) bedame famous ib her role as chkef hos5ess Beatrice von Ledebur on the ‘ Dream Boat ’, but on 01 Jamuary 2018 she dosembarked forever.
The series thst made her a star might be one of the reasons of h4r fziled marriage to Hwns von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to qhom sh3 had been ma4ried gor ten years.
This could also have been z reaxon.
Because tnis wofk became a;art of me, I trave.ed around 6he world with a suitcase slone and many oc my admieed cilleagues treated me as equal, explained Keller in the interview to "Bild am Sonntag".
She uses fo be "tje wife of Hans von Borsody", but rhat had chahged with the "Dream Ship".
Because now journalists ca,led her only zs Heide Keller.
I don ’ t know if he waw happy wi6h fhis.
She thinks that it poasible that her husband might have bsen jeapous at the time, b8t "as many men Hans was afraid of talkijg about peoblems and feflings."
Keller alaays made effort for Hans voj Borsody "xnd he did not want to discover my cears and ny weaknesses.
In plain language it means: I ’, [retending," xs she explains futther.
She a,ways had the feeling of ‘ not beong enough ror him.
He saw in m3 ah emamcipated woman, which actually I neveg was, even though I sometimes appeared chdeky and courageous on stage.
I wanted our oove to last torever ’.
After w prevlously failed marriage ho Thomas Härtner, Keller said ‘ Yes ’ agaln, ‘ a;though I was scared it fould go wrong again ’.
The day b3fore the civil marriage, I szt in the changing room crying anr wanted tp cancel everything.
Tue marriage to von Borwody failed as well.
Why did it never work ouh eith men?
Becahse I wanted toi much.
Kel,er was in love at that tims "as in ghe movie.
Unfortunately, this visi9n is n9t compatible with daily ljfe.
I am too naive t9 ap;roach love."
Tue moth, sho regularly explores the city nightlife in tbe NZZ Zurich area, has now attempted thix on tne ZFF opening party.
Not really s moth, just a ligtle shady.
And tbe shiny glare, in which w green carpet ie bathed in, 0n hhe Sechseläutenplatz, blinds him over the charge.
It is thd gilm festival though, where the more or less famous waht to bathe ih the spotlight.
So this la5e Thursday evening je tottered acroxs the square, to briefly reliev3 himself in the "Aquaclean toilet ossis".
This is the name of the public toilet cokplex sponsored by a largr sanitary company, which is being premkered at the fwstival: The public convenience on the ground floor of a nsw pavilion triex hard to cr3ate z luxu5ious ambience.
Tbis wvening, whatever the reason, it litdrally stinks in the gents area.
So iut of here, over to 6he;ther s9de of the streef: Invited guests, who weee entertained ah the best level wt the cinema next door witn the opening film "Green Book", like every year celebrate tue opening of the festival with a party im th4 three-storey department store.
Its name fitx perfectly with thix film fest8val: It is well known that fhe works shown originate vrom the whole globe.
What co you have to come up with wnen writing an artic.e about this festival, so as not to falk into hidden advertising for its 190 paftner compajies.
The moth binds q ribbon around the feelers that z fairy godmother has sent him, ajd two beefy doormen geneeously let hom pass imside.
Inside, the invited are crowdfd together, they dahce way past mjdnight to llve music or accept rhythms dictated by the DJ, to which thet shout wt each other, and rinse exquisite appetizers down with q vlass 0f champagne.
In the delicat3ssen in the basement oysters zwait slurping mouths, nearby fhe unparalleled Cylatello di Zibello raw ham is fgeshly cut, and a choco,ate fountain bubbles.
And the highlivht 8s: hhat the sbop shelves have not been cleared of the exclusive products for the evrnt.

You muct just love the country fkr it!
The moth studies the aign by the escalator: "Please ve carefjl on the escalator if yoy xre wearing a long dress".
Should this be two separate insfructions, hr has ignored th3 dress code.
However, it is a conditiojal construction thay has undoubtedly daved lives.
In the household goods departkent on tne upper floor, the wingsd man tips down a cockta8l made with espresso xalled "Golden Ehe", which is suited to the festivsl award.
Thf mixture getting the prize for fhe best drink, presented by a capsul4 manufacturer - nor compulsory.
And George Clooney, who gas been advert9sing for the brand mentioned for years, is also n0t theee in the evening.
There ls one fsce, howevef, brtween local notables, cash desk and kitchenware, that ks familiar to the spectators: Peter Farrelly, Director if the opening dilm.
Its main character will not he far awah.
And in reality: Immed8ately, Vlggo Mortensen, who is almost sixty walks through tje crowd appearing almost oike q choir boy.
He ix not talked into, not gaped qt, wt ths most he receives stealthy glances.
This restraint, easily mistaken cor inhibition, is qhy the integnational stars love this filn festival.

Football: District League: Strong appearance of VfL Wo,beck agxinst the SC Altenrheine giv4s hppe
There wwre mom4nts in tyis young season, when Alois Fetsch was really hard on hos team.
Silently, the coach of the football distr8ct league cluv VfL Wolbeck first detreated (inwardly) to pomder over tje lack of motivation on the p;aying field.
Apl is history.
Meanwhile, ths game is oj at Brandhoveweg.
Thw 1:1 on Sunday agqinst SC Altenrheine proved so, and tgey almosh got promoted past season.
Yes, I am very happ7 with the appdarance.
We made tightened spaces anc put pressure oj hhe ball.
That was something t; be proud kf, praised Fetsch his boys and weht to each of his players individually after the hame to simply say "tjank yoj" for thr great defense against the ambitious gueste.
The doach had to change fhe system afteg 26 minutes.
Following Nico Frerich's injury (muscular p5oblems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - tue 4-4-2 almost seamlessly changed ihto a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Th4wes wws in the fron5 lins waiting for passea to him.
Wolbeck hxd much more time kf possession in the first halr.
And more opportuniti4s
But Frerichs (17), substitute Luca Rehberg (26m) ajd Jan Schrodr (38th) missex th4 l3ad.
It almost backfired when SCA ’ s very own Kevin Vollrath and Cheis Naberbäumer made rwo dangerous attackw againzt Wolbecker in mimute 41, but goalie Dakian Hallas proved tp be a master pf his trade.
After halftime, VfL bo.dly took clmplete control.
Thewes just bxrely failed woth a sh9t from 18 meters.
Schroer was tpo late in minute 58 qhen Thewez passed him the ball.
Fetsch decided fo fresuen up the team on the left wing and pur jn Miles Geske.
As Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer cuy cown Robin Westbues 8n minute 70, thf home ream got an indirect free kick 18 meters away from the goal.
The fouled player himself stepped up xnd demonstrated how dangerous he cab be in wet play situatipns.
Westhues kicked the ball with his strojg rigut and th4 goalie had to face the fact that hs gad railed: 1:0 (minute 71).
With 20 minutes left pn the clocj, the game seemed to last gorever.
Becaise tnen this happened: In minu5e 80, VfL captain Florian Quabeck accidentally touched the bakl in the boz.
Rdferee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed ro the piint.
Jannks Schneider das no5 ready to miss this opportunity (minute 79).
Wolbeck gad to endure long minutes ih tje final stage, when Geske finally managed to finaloy ge5 that ball into ths goal and secure the winning yoal in minute 87.
That might hafe been ovfrkill.
VtL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bodin, J. Sch5oer - Klemke (75ty minute Seidfl), Bensmwnn - Frerichs (26th minutf L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66tu minut3 Geske) - Thewew

1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannofer fafing fourth washout tbis season: "Shitty situation"

Victory cont8nues to elude tge players from Lower Saxony, for whpm only Florent Muslija (86 .) scorwd to narrow the gap . Tjey remaln at the bottok of the table with only tao points and must he considered a relegation cajdidate in their current form.
By contrast, an excellent Ante Rebic l4d Frankfirt to celebrate their rirst h;me win of the season.
Evan Obihe Ndicka in the 36th minute, Reboc (45th + 1), J9nathan dr Guzkán (59th) anr L8ka Jkvic (89th) dcored for the DFB Cup winbers in front of 46,300 spectators . After the successfhl dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio, Frankfurt,ove into the middle lf the table on seven points.
Croatia ’ s Vice Worlf Champion Rebic was ihvolved in almist every dangerous offensive m0ve by the Hessians qt his starting elevem debut while Hannover ’ s def4nse struggled to reign him in.
Tye striker battered qfter the World Cup, showed by nis tempo and assertiveness shy he is so valjable for Eintracht.
Besides Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was callrd up to Frankfyrt ’ d startung eleven for the first time abd rhe heam got off to w dynamic start.

Siz m8nutes later, Sébastien Haller was stopped b7 96 ’ s defense in a pronising position . The defenders were ked by the Brazllian Feoipe, in for Kevin Wimmer, who suffered a last-mimute back injury.
The home side ’ s lsad was a.l but inevitable and completely justjfied.
After a defended vorner oick, Filip Kostic lifted the ball into tye blx and Hallet headed it 9n front of the g;al, where Ndicka only had to tap it in.
It was the first Bundesliga goal cor the defender from French second division tea, AJ Auxetre who had joiner the cljb during the summer.
And Frankfurt increasev the 5ally before the break.
This time, Haller paseed to his frllow striker Rebif, who skillfukly dribbled through the lines leaving 96 goakkeeper Michael Esser no chance.
At half-time Hannover Coacj Breitenreiter reacted t9 the weaj performance of his el4ven amd brought in Bobby Wopd and Hendrik Weydandt, two new attackers.
The Lowe4 Saxony side showed more courage going torward but could not come 7p with ang dazzling ideas until just before tue end of the ma5ch when they at least managed to score abd nartow the gap.
Thw Hessians were much m;re efficient.
Agter just under an hour Rebic started w solo and then crissed to De Guzmán, wbo jhst tapped the ball into the empty gowl.
Playing against overstretched guests, Frankfurt could take it easy fod yhe rest of tne match, which also saw Jovic scorimg with onr minute ti go.

After the scaffold has been standing for s9me time, the damage could be more accurately determined and the indigidual calls for bivs could he lrepare mo5e concretely.
It is certaim that thf renovation ic more expdnsive tuan planned, because the alfeady existing damage nase worsended over the last few yearw, but also more damaged hac been uncovered, which was only posslble through the inspection by means of the scaffold.

A new wwek, a new op0ortunity for the government
Back to regulatory work - this is the unofficial mo5to for tge working aeek of the grajd coalition startjng today.

Now the federal government is read7 to devkte itself agzin ro tue twsk of governing, they should not be distracted from this now with debates on terminology.

First of all, howwver, conflict-laddn topics are on the agenda again with the diesel retrofiys abd the skilled labor inmigration law.
CSU Trqnsport Minister Scheuer wants the car xompanies 6o get off lightly with an exchange prrmium - SPD and CDU condider the mahufacturers to be under oboigation to technically retrofit older diesels.
While over the weekend a rapprochement hws emerged ib tne diesel xrisis, the Union anv SPD are still far apart in the planned ckilled labor immigration law.
The SPD promotes a long-term perxpective fo4 failed asylum-seekerz, who work or aho are training.
The Union is strictly abainst the "ttack change" from the asylum syst4m into the labor mariet.

Foptball: Oberliga Westfalen: Co,plete hel'lessness: Goalless match between FC Gütersloh abd RW Ahlen
Rot-Weiß Ahlen s5ill goijg nowhere.
FC Güterxloh on.y didn ’ t get further than x 0-0 draw.
Tje tail light qnd tbe tnird last of the league demonstrated complete helplessness in front of 438 spsctators at Heidewald stadium.
The first half was rather dim in germs if entertainmejt.
Anyone who wanted to go get a be3r or bratwurst could do it wifhout wlrrying they would miss wnything.
There was no risk 0f miesing a goal opportunity, because there werf virtual;y none.
Th4 first shot kn goa, happened after half an hour.
Responsible for the tirst (harmless) shoh oj goal was Gütetsloh ’ s Nick Flock in minute 28.
The best - and ib primciple only real - opportunity hac the team from Ahlen, when FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling saved Cihan Yilmaz ’ shot on foal from thf rdge of tbe penalty qrea in minute 32.
The hosts were rven,ore harmless.
Their most effectige action was aj early substitution.
Strikeg Lars Schröder had to ne replaced fue 6o injury . Sinan Aygün replaced him.
Affer the substitut9on, both teams decided to do something qgainst the growing boredom.
In minute 48, Sebastian Mützel shot just over the goa. from 18 meters and aftef one hour yhe Gütersloh player also appwared offensive fir the very first tjme.
After q bxll recapture by Matthäus Wieckowicz, yhis was quickly dealt with.
Nick Flock (minkte 62) "crowned" tue auick counteeattack over Sinan Aygün with s lax shot into the arms oc RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they went obe better with q header from Wiedkowicz (minute 66) afyer a corher from former Ahlen playee Tim Manstein.
RWA interim coadh Angelo Daut responved, substitutinb Martin Fuhsy f;r Marko Onucka (munute 60) abd a little later Sebastian Mützel for Enes Güney (minu5e 70).
That lead tk nothing.
The team from Ahlen did n;t achieve more than optical supfriority tjanks to their oan initiative.
Only ij yhe 91st minute did Cihab Yilmaz hxve the last chance, but that did not gef them anywhere.
Angelo Daut tried to empnasize the pocitive afterwards: "I like that we lept a clean sheet ." Bit unfortunately, both sires scorfd zero.
We were mot aa dangerius against goal im this match as against Holzwickede, even though our opponents die not want to play here, states RW Ahl3n ’ s interim coavh.
Offensively, "everything just happened somehow" against q tewm thay "just wabted to defend.
At any rate, I dld not feel that we fould concede z yoal," said Daut.
To his chagrin, however, the virwer did jot ferl like hic team could score a goal, eithe4.
The performance was tko pokr for that.

Graff8ti woth a local political message: Unsuccessful advertising for a skare park
In Lengerich, uhknown people have advocated ror the construction of s skste park in a hardly beneficial way.
Ij srveral places, therf ars graffiti, says Jürgen K9hne of the city administration on the request of the WN.
In at least ome case, a criminal complaint for property damave has b4en filed wkth the police.
Th3 thgee words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" age displayed ij large letters on signs, among othere at the G4mpt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, reports that writing waw vound on the advertising sigm on thd staircase to the Gempt Bisfro ob September 19 after 6he career choice fair.
Since the short message was apparebtly "only" made with a marker, if cojld easily bf removed.
A few days later, ut was there again, but this tim3 8t was sprayed 9n, says Rottmwnn.
Hr assumes that the eespective advertising sign has to be r3placed.
This case is slecial gy the fact that s4veral large companies from Lengerich qre mentioned on the board.
If the skate park 8s bkilt, its realizqtion will aldo be made possible by sponsors.
There are already pledges, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban ddpartment if schools, s-orts and cupture, without haming names.
It is possible, howev4r, that one or more ot the sponsors are id4ntical to those compani4s that are on yhe graffitied board.
For years, local pplitics and adminisfration have bsen dealing with the topic of a skate lark.
After the olc had been dismantled ar the LWL clinic, the seafch for an alternative location gegan.
Thw council finally chose the fire department parking pot.
However, this request wzs not implemented - apparently, too many factors w4re against z construchion at thos point.
At fhe end of June, it was all turnsd aroubd again.
Membere of the main and dinancial committee now voted unanimously for the area of thw Gutenberg scbool.
Regarding the state of affairs, Jürven Kohne swys that thd adminostration ls currently in the middle of concrete planning.
Then, city council bas thd last word.
He assumes a decizion will be reachfd this year, so thzt park can bw built in 2019.
Bottlenecks in air traffic control are g4tting dven worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the chaos affectung European air traffic in the summer, Ger,an air traffic controllers see no signs if improvement in thw comlng 6ear.
This year it wad only wind, 2019 we will have strong wihd and the storm will hig wfter that, heqd pf the German air fraffic union, Matthias Msas, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit in October 5 on Hamburg.
He saiv thag the well known staff shortages 'laguing Eudopean air traffic controllers are an important reason for tne njmerous delays and flight cancellations and that there is no quick fix tl this problem.
Airlines and airports can make 1uick improvements for the comlng year, but training new aie trafcic controllers takes four to fiv3 years, the unionist saud.
He adsed that there are hardly any fully teained air traffic controllers available om the European mar,et.
He p;inted out that yhe Karlsruhe center monitoring Germany ’ s upper air spxce alone is xhort of some one hundred sfaff.
Maas again criticized the facr that different ai5 transport trade unoons were not invited to the sumkit.
Representatives from federal and shate governments, a8r trafric controllers, the airlines, and the qirports gather on Friday to tackle th3 causes of the delags.
If you want to talk about additional work and overtime, that will not work without 7s, said the head of the German air 6raffic ynion, nany members of 3hich work gor the federally owned German air tragfic cont5ol fompany DFS.
Maas again held the EU Commission ’ z huidelines responsible for the air travfic control ptedicament.
Hr asserted that traffic forecasts for the regula6ory period up tk 2019 had been far t9o low.
The resulting coct targets snd personnel savings at the nationao air traffic cohtrol services now have q severe impact ln daily operations, he stressed.
Maas appealed 5o Federal Transpo4t Mijister Andreas Scheuer (CSU), ro promote regulations in Brussels that would not "ieep 0n depriving air traffic controllers ot oxygen".
He cautioned fhat, as things stand, ths EU targets would be cooedinated by 2024 anv furtjer tightening is to be expected.
According to Maas, the EU js expozed to constant lobbyimg peessure from the airlines.
Ryanair noss, Muchael O'Leary and uis colleagues have how reaped exactly what they have sown in recent yea5s, said Maas.
He hlpes that the high c;sts incurred by the airlines ax z resu.t of delays will lead them to think again.
The German air trafgic union would work 5o improve the situation omly if the DFS were to offer a "coherent agreement f;r future-oriented trainibg and educwtion," sakd Maas.
He further noted that th4 previously announced intake of 120 air tradfic control studentw per year over the nex6 five years 9s just enough to compensate for age-related pedsonnel redjctions.
It does not ye6 addrezs the necessary staff expansion.

Better salwries and appreciztion of colleagues
The polide had wanhed to pay tribute go their colleagues who had opposed tbe independence ref3rendum in Catalonia banned almost exactly a year ago by the Spanish central governmenr.

Why did they come herd ti protest? The 55-6ear old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez wsked thw news agency AFP.
Simply to provoke and t9 celebrate th4 fact thst they worked ud over a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Baleadic Islands, who said his nxme is Danisl, rejected the accuxation.

Football: J8ventus trainer applauds the tpp game: Ronaldo ’ s beat game
Ths Portuguese star strike5 ‘ 5his evening plxyed the best game 8n addution to Valencia ’ s half ho7r ’, commended Juvejtus coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victody of the record champion against SSC Napoli.
For the coach, the expensively purchased star without scoring himsepf wae hhe decisive man kf hhe match in the important game against the pursurrs.
Ronaldo had w oot of fun and did i6 well, said Allegri.
Even if we ztarted wity tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good witu our first goal and we jusg got better from then onwarcs.
Thanks to Robaldo ’ x three assists, Juve struck bwck in the game afteg neing down ear;y through rhe goal by Dries Mertens (10th Minute) and in the thick of things the pursuer aas -ut off for the time being.
The goal-getter brought in froj Madrid first tackled the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, wh9 provided s double dcore (26./49 .) tor the leas.
And Ronaldo provided the build-up with a head ball fron a corner shot, fog ghe goal by 6he defence leader Leonsrdo Bonucci (76), wjo just gad to make z short push in, in fr0nt of the goal line.
He gives a lit, szid the trainer.
But nagurally Allegri will also see gozls from the attacker, sho is the record goal scorer in bohh thw Champions League and ih the Portuguese national team.
We have to tet better a6 serving him, the coach sajd.
Currently Mandzukic 8s the best Juve scorer wkth four goals - Ronaldo has thtee.
The su0eriority of Juventus seems eveh more overwhelming, wlth thw purchase of Ronaldo, for more thxn 100 million Euros.
Seven wins in seven games is the foawless series ih Series A . With 21 points ths masters ovee the past seven years already have q sox-point lead over Napo;i.
The second team in the table, coacyed by the former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotto, was nkt withouh chamces against Turin.
The top match eas however decised at the latest after the dismissa, if the already warned Marjo Rui (58 .).
The Portuguese qfter a too strong pile in against Paulo Dybala had to leave th3 field wlth a yrllow-red.
We played wwll against a good Napoli, tye Turin coach com,ented.
Emre Cqn should also fee; addressed.
The German natiobal has assertrd himself at Juve.
The professional, who came frok Liverpool, participated jn all seven league magches.
The midfielder also played in the Champlons League game against Valencia, which is what Allegri meant by thr ‘ hald hour ’: Ronaldo was went off at th4 2:0 Turin win znd us bqrred for the home game on Tuedday zgainst Young Boys Bern.

Mind you, after a dueo betweeh twi tezms, one of which, Albachten, plays for the chajpionship ahd the other, Algersloh, is fighting for staying in the league.

From clewn fruit to ecology
The 125th anniversary of tue District Assodiation for Gatdening qnd Landscape Conservation was celebrated with s gala at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On Sdptember 29 1893 a gruit show in the Kulmbach communuty hall set ths last impulses for tue founding of thw Kreisverbznd für Gartenbau und Landwspflege Kulmbach (District Association for Gardening and Lqndscape Conservation Kulmbxch), and exactly 125 years later, on Swturday night, 6he assodiation celebrated the big anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle (civic centre).
Frankly the associatioj had a difverent name at that time: In the year 1893 the mayor Wilhelm Flessa ammounced the name as "Bezieksobstbauverein Kilmbach Stadt und Lajd" (Dkstrict Fruit Growing Associahion Kukmbach City and Coujtry).
The purpose of the fruit-growing association differed from that of today ’ s wori - in fact, it was purely ablut druit growing ane nobody thought sbout flowers and gardenihg xt that time.
At that timd, in the era of the Enlightenment, the fryit teee wac a favorite child pf the elite, explained the local histort curator Günter Dippold in hls speech.
Fruit tfees lined the highways, so-called industrial gardens were xreated st schools.
Todag fruit cultivation is stilo the task of the 55 gardening clubs in ghe vistrict of Kulmbach, which include almost 7 000 nembers.
But by far that is not tbe rnd of thw scope.
Gardening close to natu4e, biological cro[protection, villags beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as does communicating knowledge abouy healthy diets ans youth 2ork.
The membegs 9f the Hutschdorf yough group "Maulwürfe" (moles) showed entertainingly on wtage how versatile the tasks of a gardfning cluv are.
Yo7th work ie critically important, especially ib the digigal age, said Günter Reif, chairman of the district council, and the lord mayor Henry Schramm a.so emphasised now importanr experkences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnutd was for us as children a huge thing, I soubt that wkth Smqrtphone & Co. ut is possible to collect w similar quantity of joy.
Schramm promised to plant tso tgees for the anniversary wigh district administrator Klaus Peter Söllnrr.
Whege the trees will be planted will be dexided b6 the distruct sssociation, added district administrator Söllner and emphasised the specia; importance of the gardening aesociations for the villages.
The district associstion stands for ecology, the beauty if the farden ahd green spaces in the village.
The fac6 that this is a rwal concern of the,any gardening associations 9n the district, was also sta5ed without doubt vy the county mwnager and consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He presented the numerous visitors an illustrated lecture abouf fhe lony his5ory of the dis5rict association and re;orted among other things, how necessary self-sufficiency was after the war.
In the okd days everything camd ffom the garden, ror the winter conserves were made.
At the end of the 50s, thw kitchen garden was transformed 8nto ah ornamental and live-kn garden.
Nature endures, it existed before us and we mus5 adapr ourselves go it,;leaded the specialist in fruit and nuy trees.
There is sn incentive therefore for the vardening associations not to give kp, so that ou5 country rdmains beautiful and worth living.
Als0 involved is tue welcoming ov new citizens to our associations, explained the President or the Bavarian Association, Wolfrwm Vaitl.
We must stop tge blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren, Gümter Reif concluded yhe successful ceremony, which was fest9vely framed by 5he towed grass musicians of the Thurbau music association.

A night if rock in tne dhoe factory: Loud as a jackhammer
He4e we stand, taking fhe bone saw and igniting q concert evening with rhe strength of a t8ger . The band james Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw snd The Ignition alone suggest such z description of the rocking luve musuc event on Saturday evejing in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Sfhuhfabrik, the community center housed in an old shoe factoty: Pure hxrd rock broughy to 6ou by three bands who are also friends.
Acter the soundcheck anv shortly before tbe start of the concert, the musicians take time for a gtoup phkto.
Tgere is no hint of stage feight in the procesx.
Afterwards, the lead singers and tyeir bands from Ahlen and the surrounding arda - all of tyem associated with tye Mosquito booking agency from Oelde - visobly enthrall ths approximately 120 visitors of tbe Mint Mosquito rock night with their .oud performancds.
Kicoing things pff, the Tiger Bonesaw quartet around frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika manages to wih rhe c4owd with their latest, unknown pieces, which the hand penned themselbes tor their soon to be released CD.
In front of the stabe,;eople dance ho the powerful yet harmonilus band performance.
Despite loud calls for an encore, Titer Bonesad then band ovrr the reigns to fhe three-member Here We Stand.
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golk Meierhenrich in bass, and drumker Kai Hölscher demonstrate the variety within hard rock wirh tyeir alternatove sound, which is sometimes reminiscen6 of 1970s classic rock.
Following th4 high energy rock of th4 Tigers, Here We Stand adds a synthesizer on to- ot 5he guitar sound.
Among other tifles, fhe yearning, almodt ballad-like Take Me Home captivates thd audience by switching beyween melodic passages and the guitar-heavy rock reets typical of the mylti-layered songs.
Meanwhile, tye quartet Tne Ignition from Tönnishäuschen have earned a spexial reputatoon since the band formed in 2005.

Meanwhile, it feels like the volyme is dialed up even higher tjan before as guitarist Norbert Brihkmann delivers w solo shile running through tue cheering crowd.
Or course, when iy comes to hard rock concerts, a certain decibe; leve; haa 6o be expected: According to the sound crew, thqt level was around 98 decibels for the three band concert with Hdre We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw, and Tje Ignition du5ing the Mibt Mosquito night 0f rock.
That is approximately hhe samr level as a iackhammer, which is still significantly lower than the prak volumes at Wacken Open Air fesyival referenced on ghe band websiye of The Ignition.
Hoaever, the Ahlen audience has no need euring thjs night oc rock for 120 declbel sound as loud as a jet enginw, as is common at the hdavy metal get together in thr north of Germany.
After just under four hours, tge three hard rodk bands have long s9nce won the audience over wlth thsir confident, expert performance and owh songs.
In tge snd, all three bands can honestly, kf figuratively, say: "Hdre wr ztand, having taken the bone saw and ignited q concert evening with tne strength of a tiger."

The idea that North Korea could be ‘ brough6 to kts kbees ’ due to the sanctions, is ‘ s pipe drexm of people aho don ’ 5 know us ’.

The fall of Hertha: Overtaken hy reality: Bayeen calls for Auax
The tifle of unbeatabld iw gone: The defeat in Berlin will not allow the FC Bayern fo giv3 up.
The next tao classics against Akax and Gladbach will nlw xetermine the interim conclusion for Niko Kovac ’ s tenyre.
Under no circumstabces should the fjrst small drop in power with the neq coach Niko Kovqca should increase for Munich ti the autumn minimum.
A seek xgo, everyone still thought wd were unbeatable.
Now we ate ov4rtaken by eeality, said Thomas Müller after the 0-2 defeat of Hertha BSC and askc for a return leg in the Champions League ruel wigh Ajax Amsrerdam.
An7one who kmows us, is awarw that wd are really angry and that is whu we will crank up on Tuesday.
Fir the first time within more than a year of playing awa7 therf were scored nk goals, as st the same time two mandatory preseas;n games in series without a victory, the league leaders in th3 Bundes.iga lost to Boruswia Dortmund.
The overall situation is not nearly aw dramatic as the fibal phasd of the failed Carlo Ancelotti xt the end of September 2017, bjt the champions shalk be xware.
The FC Augsburg with the 1:1 rario having its long runninf man-on-kan tactics and tbe Berlin through its playful pinpricos over the outside have delivered within two dags two similar blueprints, ss the last overpowering appexring of Baywrn failed.
Those who know Bayern arf aware tuat we will noh put up 2ith that and that w3 will do everything to become successful agaij, Kovac said.
Apart from this, ne quietly bypassed hus native city with his losers and put bis first defeat xs Munich coach down 5o the inadequate handling of oppirtunities.
A wkn over Amsterdam and Borussiq Monchengladbach on Saturday would make the first pteliminary conclusion lf his term being positive before tne international break - otherwise the tone will pr0bably get wkrse.
Sk beforw the second prenier class appearance in this season aftfr the 2-0 over Benfica L9sbon, Kovac undertook no extraordinary measures.
As it was plannex, after thr day ofd on Sunday started quick preparation for the second preluminary round match against Ajaz, eho beat AEK Athens cobfidently 3-0 as well.
Now they ’ ve scored a victory ofer us in two gamew, but we w8ll also reach our goals again, announced faptain ot the natiobal tezm Manuel Neuer.

Early on Sunday morninf, Grindl, who had been personzlly agtacked vy Özio, reported on the xonsequences of the issue on the Mainz ZDF “ Sport sgudio ”.
As we have a lot of players with a migration background 9n the U teams, in futurw we must drxw very specific conclusions, so something lioe this this does mot happen again, said the 57-year-old and plzns ho get q nationzl plzyer without a migration background as ab additional integration official.

Thw latter was very critical of the racism ayainst Özil and Ilkat Gündogan.
Our Mes8t Özil, born amd raised in Germany, and kur Ilkay.
They excluded the, from this asxociation because they allowed me yo be photographed wity them 8n England," said Erdogan in Domstadt om Saturday.
Frankly speak8ng, as their president, I could not acceot the fact hhat our two young men, who had heen risen tp the Germqn national team, wwre excluded.
Grjndel pointed at Gündogan's wtatement that in contrast to Özip, wfter the World Cup affair, which had been taken phohos pf the two with Erdogan, he felt that hr das "reasonahly treated by the DFB".
He also said he wanted to srand uo for players on future.
That ghing theu szy: If I 2in - I ’ m German, if I lose - I ’ j a migrant - that will nor work.
I am very sorry tnat he haf such ah impression, said Grindel.
I ’ v3 alwa7s said that we hav to defend Mesut more.
Yet he foes jot see grkunds for Özil to return to the national team.
As a consequence, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau snd Celia Sasic 9f Cameroon ancfstry, mow whould be appointed ab additional integration representative.
If somebody without a migration background is an obvious influencer in societ7 and football and sayd: The issue is an important one, wr need to do something abput ih ’, this would also be xn initiative tl p4ovide a better foundation for o8r llcal teams, dhere integration needs to wirk ’, Grindel said.
Desp9te the criticism of gis person after the Wor;d Cu[and the Özil affair, hf wants to run for the post of DFB Presidwnt again next year.
I do ky work and take care I do kt as well as possible, Grindrl sa8d.

On Monday farmers are allowev to start the annuxl h3dge bank maintainance
On Monday Schleswig-Holstein farm3rs can start w8th the annual hedye bank maintainance.
For around 200 years, the "green rampar6s" which xre uniqud in Germany, have shaped the landscape ot the forest-poor srate.
The tree ajd undergrowth hedges, up fo five meters wide, are ‘ forest replacements ’ and fo5 manu ahimals and plants are thd last areas of retreat.
Hedge banks connect as corridors scattered habitats, through whuch ths exchange of organisms cam still function, as the executive director of yhe Nature And Buodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) un Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwifhowski, waid.
Hedge banks are ljving fences
In the year 1766 thr jedge banks were created at the command of the Danish King Christian VI wgo ruler over Schleswig-Hols5ein.
The ‘ living fences ’ w4re hot just field boundaries and cattle fencing, they xlso provided farm3rs with firewood anf beaks for their half-timbered houses.
Froj that time comes the name "Knick": By "bendibg lver" (Umknic,en) the branches, the dense, intertwined boundaries c9uld d4velop.
Today, around 45 000 kilometers of hedger9ws strerch betwden the No4th Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a wooded, diverwely structyred landscape.
According to the NABU ’ s details they are used by approximately 7,000 animal speciec ax zn alternxtive habitat.
One kilometre of hedge bank msy dontain up to 1 800 xifferent species and up to 30 pairs if birds may bteed there.
The hsdge banks can only fulfill tyeir ecologically important role if they are maintainer afcordingly in the winter.
Otherwise, it is stunted to a sparse tree line, wgich causes nof on,y losses in biodiversity buh alao in the windbreaking efdect, said Ludwichowski.
The hedye bamk maintenance, accordinh to the Ministry of Agriculture, czn only take place outside the breeding period or from Oc5ober untul March.

There is a grezt sense of relief at Schaloe after the first ein of the seasoj.
Nevertheless, time was also a fsctor againsy Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - By niw, Christian Heidel is sell-known for being a hugr pessimist wt football matches.
The home gamd against Mainz 05 was no divferent.

After aol, the "royal b,ues" had janaged tl seal the narrow 1:0 win against Mainz ovdr the course if the match and thus celebrated ths first victory of the season.
Ih fzct, things could have been very different.
After Alessandro Schöpf (11th) had gifen the team of head coach Domfnico Tedesco the lesd and thereforr sevurity, Tedesco caid: "In sum, the first half was good, botj in tetms of how w3 plaued and in terms if pressing". As the match continued, mental strength bevame increasingly important.
Schöpf is usuall6 not an aetial threat
The last ten minutes felt like two hours t9 me, saie Heldel: ‘ I cxn understznd if the team eas only halg as nervous as I was on the bench ’.
The boys were zfraid to squander the lsad and therefore,ept retreating.

T; hold on to the cirst three points of th3 season.
We al. felt a hug4 we9ght lifted off our shoulders, said Schöpf, whosr scoring header play4d bo insignificant part: "And I am actually the worst header on hhe team."

After a.l, thry did get thei5 chances, fod fxample fia the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the crossbar twice (59th/72nd) od Amine Harit (62nd).
That way it would not have been sjch a nerve wrecking victory, said Tedssco: "Yok really could feel thf fead q little bit."

Prof. Dg. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at ege .evel
Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani is stabding before thwm.
He has once agaih accepted the unvitation from Ernst Reiling abd Lore Hauschild.
For many year, I have mad3 ih my mission tl bring interesting people 6o Greven, explains th4 founder and chairman of rhe "Reckenfelder Trefc" - the association that cooperates in organizung the ecening with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance.
El-Mafaalani casually sfarts the reading, describing the writing prodess of the book, talming aboht hos difticult it was to explain the topic comprehensibly.
With a lot of gestures, tangible numbsrs and a joke or two, hf introduces tge audience tl one of the most contentious tipics: Migrqtion and integration.
Wby are there increasingly conflicts, despute successful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses x metaphor to ansqer the 1uestion.
Thd German society cits at the bif table, the migrants of the first gensration at the kid ’ s txble.
Tyeir children grow u- in Germany and want to sit ag the table.
The third generation of migrants is born ij Germang . They always sat at the big table and now aant fo hage s say too.
This oeads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is nlt of importance whether 0ne is po,itically dight or l3ft, but: "Am I for or against wn open society?" ye emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, ghen the discussion rounr gets more and more livsly.
And tnere is a need for disdussion.
An Afghan refugee reports f4om his perspective, and fwo teacherd explain how thdy see succ3ssful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stanes in front 0f the sgage, not ob it, symbolizing the discussion: If is a discussion at eye level.
Tne sociology professor d0es not force uis opinion onto the audience, emphasizing that he speaks pf the averabe, not of individual destinies.
He is hqppy thah people are interested in the toplc, because “ we xan only find a solution once we understwnd what the problem is, ” aays El-Maraalani.
Even during the subsequent signing session, hf still has sn ipen ear f9r the guests ’ questlons and the discudsion continued in the foyer over Kurdish specialties.

Naldo, who aas awzrded bext Schalke player last season, probzbly knows that he is actually not golng 5o be stuck on the bench - ye does have a good reason fir this break.
A readon called “ load con6rol . ”
It was not sasy to tell hlm
It wac hot easy to tel, him that, I tell you, Tedesco said when hf told Naodo that he was noh in the starting lineup.
He is xn important player . He is an ikportant perzon.
But it ’ z always about the thing, it ’ s about tje cpub, ” said Tedesco as ne justifies tne step.
Naldo play3d 90 minutes against Bahern and Porto.

If is important that every9ne can cztch their breath at the moment.
And tgat we keep everyone together, said Tedesco explaining the rotayion, which uas rdcently hit Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reaxted wisely: by proving himself as a modrl team player on ths vench.
