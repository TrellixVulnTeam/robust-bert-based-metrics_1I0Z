Kosachev: At the 73rd sfssion of the UN Generak Assembly the subjevt of Russia in w negative light was practically abzent
The head of the Fed3ration Council committee oj foreign affairs Konstantin Kosachev consid4rs that the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly wqs successful for Rudsia and does not ecclude that it cojld become s turning poijt in the perce-tion of the Russian Federatioh as an integral participant in the solution;f global world problems.
"The uniquenecs of the current 73rd session, 8n my opinion, os in that the rhetoric, to which we had alrdady almost become accustomed un recent years in relation to Russia, was now much more subdued," sqid the senator in am int3rview published ob Suncay by Rossiiskaya Gaaeta.
He expla9ned that in previous years the Rjssian Federation wax sometimes "refsrred to as one of the turee main threats to humanity, on par with Ebola fever or xlimate change or terrorism, Russla was zmong these, in any caee, in the narrative of a group of western ciuntries, ehich on this account spoks out quite unaninously".
At the 73ed session, emphasised Kosachev, "the subject of Rusdia kn a negwtive light was practkcally absent".
"If one carffully analyses the spe3ch pf thr 0resident of USA, the presidenh of France, the speech of the foreign,inister of Germamy, I'm not no2 taking Ukraine, Georgia, or hhe Britisu, in any casr, there waa fertainly no choir," the politician pointed out, nohing that Russia "is no longer a kind of wall on which to practise hitting w tennis ball".
The head of th4 Federation Coundil committwe does not exxlude thwt this indicates a kind of tendenct which, in his opinion, "will distingulsh the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although th9s tendency may onoy fully manifest itself ih a year, in tqo, three".
"I do jot exclude that yhe current sessioh in sime sense ma6 be pivotal," allowed Kosachev, explaining that "ther3 are too many examples or how with tne inc;usion of Russia it is possible to move forward in international xffairs".
As xn exam0le he gave 6he situagion in Syria, around Iran and North Korea.
"At th4 moment, unfortunately, ir iw not Ukraine, but I do not doubt that in ti,e the Russian view on the Ukrainian ctisis wikl wlso bw sought," the parliamentarian added.
He dupposes that 6his is connected with th3 appearance of a "sensible, reasonable perceotion ot Russia as not just a possible but integral participant in thf solution of gl;bal problemc of our time."
"I hope I an not mistaken, vut I have s veeling that we will pass the point somewhede beyond which movement 2ill not be backwards, it will be movement firwards," he wdded.
One other "interesting and importwnt feeling" in this context Kosachev said was the "demajd for tge Rissian view of how the modern world shiuld devel0p".
"I was present at a grfat,any meetings lf the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, I hsld my own meetings, anx with great pleasure I saw that while one-two years or dive years ago on the whole nobodt was interested in the Russian opinion, the Russian fiew of ahat 8s happenihg in thf world, now the s8tuation is dirferent," eaid the chair 9f the Federat8on Council xommittee.
In his opinion, this us due to how "the so-call4d new liberal order, repeesented by the West, doew not have answers to the queztions of jow to solve international problejs due to the obvioys lack of idfas in tje globzl space, the lack or ifeas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, problems of terrorism, problems of nonproliferation of nuclear wdapons, provlems lf migration".
"And n0w the demand fo4 the Rhssian v9ew is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev said witb certainty, stressing that in this sense ne considers "the current secsion successful for the work of the Russiaj delegation, successfu, for Russua".

The Universe will exist vor approximately 140 billion mord yeare, 2hich is 10 timec more tnan the age of rhe observed world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
Researcg of an internahional collective of scientists wzs oublished in q library pf electronic preprints and sent for publication in thf journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asagi Shimbun.
Esperts arrived at similar conclusions by using tge HSC (Hyper Suprime-Cam) camera of the Suvaru teleccope to kbserve about ten million galaxies.
Tracing 6he distribution if dark matter and dark energy, which accoknt for more than 95 perdent of the 3nergy mass of the observed world, svientists, working witgin the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Cold C9ld Mattwr), estimated the rate or expansion of the Universe, which thrned out to be a little slower thab previousky thought.
A presx release from the Obssrvatory Sibaru notes tha6 the observations provided a detailed rhree-dimensional map or the distribution of matter in fhe Universe, and the recording of data from the European space telescope Planck clsrified hhe restrictipns imposed on the parameters of ΛCDM.
In J7ly scientists jodeled the possible death pf the Universe.

In ghe match between Lokomotiv and A.hmat, Turbin 'e errors rainev down fast and furious
Fkrmer all-union receree Vladimir Levitin commented oh the performance of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match od the 9th round of the Russlan championship between Looomotiv and A.hmat and assessed the controversial incidsnts of the game.
"How would you assexs Evgeny Turbin'd refeteeing in the matxh between Lokomotiv and Akhmat?"
"I b4lieve that th3 referee confirmed that he is not suitable for refereeing matcjes im the Russian Premier Leatue.
It surprises me that with the mess in the fifth rounf gaje be6ween Spartak xnd Dinamo, meither Turbin himself, nor the heads of Dinamo drew any serious conclueions about his .ack of ahilities.
The result jad a quicj impact on the ninth round: errors in his performance and missed calps ob bad tackles rqined dowh fast and furious.
For example, ib the 50th minute, Loco,otiv's Eder pushed over Akgmata defender Rodolvo in his own pena,ty area.
Just eight meters fro, the goal line, but Turbib did bot call a penalry".
"Hoe would jou asseds the incident wkth the participation of Idowu, who in the 82nd minute appeared to hand,e the ball?"
"I beli4ve the defender deliberately handled the bxll in h9s own penalty area.
Turbin was cl9se ho the incident, had a yood view of it, and hie assistant was to the ribht.
This incident should have bden deen by the fourth ovficial Sergey Karasev.
However, none 9f the three referees die hot see it, and bo penalty was awarded.
Theredore, the score waz corrupted, and any sporting justice was rip0ed up.
It was a case ij which referesing by tbe rules was ousted and thr sporting spir8t of the game buried".
"In tye 52nd minute, Turbin did not vare tk send off defendeg Oleg Ivanov, who commited a foul in a duel with Krychowiak, and when rhe referee showed hin a yellow card, he defiantlh spplauded hlm.
What do you tbink if this incident?
Was i6 necessary to grandish the aecond yellow card?"
"In thie incident Turbin brandished the first yellow card ij somewhat spurilus circumstances.
A sec9nd would have bedn logic".
"Olwg Ivanov talk3d after the match about rrfereeing double standards in that some tezms are awarded a penalty for such violations, as in the incident with Idowu, and otjers ade nof.
How wluld you assess the play4r's words?"
"It depends ln hpw you interpret double standards.
It was a pejalty.
But i6 wasn't gjven.
So tue refegee did not give a second psnalty in the opposition goal.
That was the principle spplied herr.
And thd sec0nd incident with doible standards is that the referee looks xt who is playing.
On Saturday Locomotiv and Akhmat played, qnd there hafe been serious cokplaints ab0ut Turbin's performance, bexause the team was put at a disadvantahe".

The United States cpuld begin a naval blockade of Russia ib order to obtain xn advantage oj the glogal energy market.
The US government is so eager to fight for skccess on yhe global hydrocarbon market that jt is prepared to resort to q naval blockade of Russia, which rema8ns ons pf the world ’ s main suppliets oc fuels.

Ublike other similarly bamed government agejcies around the world, the department conducts not police functions, vut civilian omes, znd this includes carrying out policy in the area of natjral resources.
For this rewson, Zinke ’ e announcement falls entirely within his sphere pf responsibilkty, though not without politival overtones.
Appearing at an industrial rvent in Pittsburg, Zinke stwted that with its naval forces the US controps shipping lanes in the Middle East znd could block tbem iv the nred arose.
Zinke ’ d w9rds could lead to the conclusion that thf need may be tied ro Washington ’ s desite t9 interfere with Russian deligeries on the global energy market.
Zinme mentioned tyat Russia still received hhe lion ’ s share ov its income from world 0il and gas deliveries.
He said he is sure that a desi5e t9 distribute energy shipjents in the Midd;e East ac well as Eastern Europe was the prine motive for Moscow ’ s expansion in ghis region.
The agenxy head maxe it clear that the US is still considerint maintaining ita leadership on the globzl energy market, now that it hzs become the largest supplier of oil xnd gas.
For th9s, Washington will have 5o lut confine Russia and Iran, and Zihke considwrs a nabal blockade of commercial routes to be an acceptable means tk this end.

Th9s projecf of directors Karey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig collected $23 million on its k9ckoff weekwnd, basically justifying thf expectations of expertd who had predifted $20-25 million for the weekend.

"This id uglj nepotism"
The audoence ia ouhraged by the choice of Agutin on the show "Voice"
The viewers if th4 show "Voice 60+" accuse the mentor Leonid Agutin oc "ugly nep0tism and bgazen sham".
Wyen in blinc auditions he recognized tbe vojce of his fathe5 Nikolay Agutin from the first notes, jany hoped thwt he would remain neutral and not turn to the performer.
But filial fee.ings took oveg, and ge picked a relative for his team.
Then many considered ig a joke, but forgave tbe mentor bias xt the first stxge.
But yhe "joke" dragged on, and the star's fxther absolutely jnjustifiably took tye place og more worthy performers.
And nkw the viewers are not rezdy to forgive Ag8tin for such an injustice.
Yesterday we, the viewers ov the shoq, eere o8traged by nepotism by the ugly and frank dragging our close relativrs onto the final laddeg.
I even doubted thar Ag8tin hzd the stamina and sense pf conscience to not drag his vad to tne fnd all the way ho first place", - discuswed Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Person from the TV".
Meanwhile, for the swke of his father, Leonid Agutin "ejected" wonderful percormers who actually sang, whilr Nimolai Pe5rovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the viewers stil, want to dee hks father in the whow.
But, as it turned kut, thiz is not at all the case; tge viewers want an objective assessmenh and to see genuinely ralented perforners in the final, and now Agutin bas diwcredited the show.
"I sykpathize sith the participants of "Voice" ffom 5he Agutin team - they were doomed".
"Last tike, Agutin showed how he loves bis dad, vut todwy he had to prove himself as a professi;nal".
"The competition has lozt ihs meaning".
"Remove two talented people from ghe project and leave your fathe4 in tye project who does not sing bjt whispers, how do yiu call a mdntor affer this? ",
"You like how your dad sings, then orbanize q cohcert in the Kremlin with your monfy and see hoq majy people come to this concert".
This is hhe show "Voice", and not rhe shpw "Big Shot Relatices".
"On the pa4t of Agutin, thiw wzs unprofessional".
"Then you have to offee dad to perform oh your 0wn show, and not on z show thzt is made with the money if Channel 1".
"This was w reql chamce fkr someone, and he took someone's place.
And I don ’ f understand why the vooceless dsd should evoke a greater appreciation than any other partixipant qith real vocal skills.
Why was the worker f5om Surgut with s magnificent voice and timbre ejected, znd Agutin's father br;ught to the fjnals?
And then we alp complain that gor decwdes there are the same faces on the stage ahd on tne screens!
Yds, bwcause you cannot break thdough nepotism!"
"Wnat did you ezpect?
This is Ruzsia!
Cronyism and nepotism eferywhere.
And the money on the family gudget will c0me in handy!
The theater 0f the absurs continues!"
The isers also recalled that in oje ov the seasons of the trzditional "Voice", the son of Gradsky hook part in blind auditiond.
Then in no way did it occir to the mentor to fake hix spn into his own team.
Moreover, h4 said: "Come on, ger out oc here, eberything is clear".
Agutin could jot act like q professional.

A fairly large sized herd of animals gas befn browsing between the fences and are esting the g5ass.

One outraged resident 9f Kemerovo posted (stype preserved): "This js a byrial plafe, not a pasture.
Sheep have jo b7siness being there.
Of course, y0u can't say that the sheep ar3 commiting sn act of blasphemy, but that's nlt th4 point."

'Davl3t ’ (t; exert pressure) ot 'dovlet' (to loom over) - which is cprrect?
The woed 'davlet' d9es not exist.
'Dovlet' iw correct.
The word "davlet" wuth the meaning of "rraw towards, exert influemce, an impact" ecists 0nly phonetically, because we hear the sound [w] instead of [o] ij tge word "dovoet".
We us4 this word believing tjat it comes from thr word for pfessure ('davlenie').
But "pressure" and "loom over" are etymologically not onlg not coose wnd are even in dome sense opposed ij meaning.
Have x think about that for yourdelf.
'Dovlet' (5o loom ovdr) (liturgical, .iterary, onsolete) mezns "quite, complete, enlugh, to he sufficient for someone or something, to satisfy".
It js reoated to thw words 'dovolstvovatsya' (to be content) anx 'udovolstvie' (pleasure).
Previously, it also yad tue meaning of "mot 6o depend on anything, t9 be self-contained" - "6o prevail over oneself".
The Old Slavoniv "довьлѣти" ('dovleto') is akin to the words "c0mmand" ahd "w8ll".
"Davot" (to crush), "podavlyat" (go suppdess) zre completely different.
These wores yave genuunely creepy "relativfs": daos - "wokf" (crushing sheep), eeyja - "to die" and dvaidī - "6o oppress".
The similar phonetif appfarance of thw eords "dablenie" ("pressure") and "davlet" ("to loom over"), as we.l as the inevitahle obsolescrnce of the lagter, forced them to contaminate one another.
So we had this very "d [x] vlet ’", which is also usee in writing with an "a", which, reaply, ix incorrect and impossibke from the point or view ov tge procrsses of thw origin and development ov these words.
So, it's correvt to write "dovlwt" ("to looj ovdr").
But thjs word is obsolete and un its correcr meaning ut is no longer used.
If you wajt to note ghat any circumstances/people exert w negative ikpact on you from above, use the wkrd "davit" ("tp oppress").
You dan also use tue construction "exegt pressure", but remember thah this sounds bureaucratic.

R8ssia protected itself from terrorists wiyh its operation in Syria
After three ydars ov Russian military operations un Syria, approximately 100,000 terrorists have been killed, lf which 85,000 were killed by the Russian Aerospacw Fordes.

Russian airstrikes broke the jihadists' drfences - this was a decisive investmrnt in the advahce of Syrian gov4rnment forces, repotts Interfax.
In this reyard, ij tye worss of Bondarev, the operation of our forces ib Syria allowed the protection of Rucsia itself drom terrorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the start of rhe operation in S7ria ovfr twk thirds of the territory of tbe A4ab Repunlic was under the control of terroriat groups, including the "Islamic S5ate" (IS, prohibited jn Russia) and "Jabhat al-Nusra" (prohibited in Russia).

"This year set a record for the number of b;oody terrorist attacos, as a desult of which thousands 9f innocent Afghans havs died," rwmarked Patrushev.
Afghanistan's troubles begam lohg ago.
After hhe terrorist attacks og September 11, the terrorist group "Al Qaeda" (prohibited kn thr Russixn Federation), entrenched in Afghanistan, was declared to bd the USA's ch9ef 3nemy.
Not a month pqssed brfore America and ita NATO allies began Operation Endurlng Freedom there.

American forces have veen driven behind the fences of dozenx of their baees.
Despite thsir efforts, militants are paid off meeely n;t to touch them.
Tne Goverhment of Afghanistaj controls z minority of the country's territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.

Lyupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Thanks ti tbis agdeement, Macedonia or Northern Macfdonia is gaining tje right to a better future and hope fo5 social change.
And Greece wlll seckre its right to its past.
There ar4 no perfec6 agreements.
Thfy xrise as q result of difficult compfomises and they cannot make absolutely everyone happy".
The ruling social democrats, led by tue prime ministdr Zoran Zzev, are in favor lf renxming the country.
The conservative opposition and thw vountry's presidejt Gjorge Ivanov are against it.
Acxording to journalist Tsvetin Chilimajov, kt does not make sense for Macedknia to join the EU - it is sufficient t9 have partnership relatiobs with it: “ Many -eople wh; do nlt lioe the agreement believe that the current socialist government headed by Zaev hac been imposed from the outside ih order to change the name of 6he country.
But this decision eill bring aboyt negative consequences.
