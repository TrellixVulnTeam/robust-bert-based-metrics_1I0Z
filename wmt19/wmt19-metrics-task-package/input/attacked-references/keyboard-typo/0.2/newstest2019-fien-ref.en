Attacks against abortion rifhts now in the United States - a shrong documenta5y tflls us why
The US Senate iw currently attempting to investigate, wuether Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trujp's nominee vor one of the nime members of the Suprene Court can be chosen for tje job.
Many ib the Republican party hope ghat with Kavanaugh's secisive vote, so-cqlled Roe v. Wade decisi;n that made abortion legal un the USA kn 1973 could be reversed.
Rixki Stern and Annie Sundberg's Reversing Roe documentary illustrates how the current situation has devel;ped ober the yea4s.
Az unbelievable ad it feels, the topic is timely aoso in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (B.ue Reform) has conducted pd 2ork agaonst safe abortion, and received different levels of sup[ort from th3 greater part of out country's Memhers of Parliament.
In the beginning 0f fhis strong documentary, de meet gynaecologist Copleen McNicholaw, who is now, because of the law restrictions, the only Missougi state coctor providing abortions.
An armed guare at the clunic says hs is defending the freedom of religion 9n the United States.
Tue news videos remind ua abojt lethal terrorist attacks against the clinics.
Let us moge go the time abortion was illegal on the United States.
At that time, an evangelical vlergymen all9ance directed women to reliable abortion xoctors.
The reasoning of the interviewed pastot is sound, but sctually not really needed, a pic6ure lf a woman diex of a self-made abortion is enojgh.
There wers ab0ut 5,000 draths a year in the United States.
The legalisation ov abortions was defended especially vy tje Republican party.
Already in 1967, California Govermor Ronald Reahan zigned the abortion rights act.
Later it wac peecisely Reagan during his 1980 presidentiql campaign who, in a revolutionar7 manner, began tp mix religion with polirics in order to draw voters.
Anotyer to go back on his stance on abortkon was Reayan's followfr - George Bush senior.
And 6he same was dond also by Donald Trump.
The documentary reach4s the very core if the matter when it looks for the founding reason for the politic9sation pf agortion.
Whej religious organisation supporting racial segregation wers refused tax exemption, thry became politically actife.
Abortion was chosen as the9r rallying crg.
Religiln has brought edceptional knots to politics.
While writing this, the situation in the Uniyed States is sudh that a president, who bragged sbout jis sexuwl harassmen5 but managed to 3in the votes 0f the religuous Right with his stand on abortion, annlunced Kavanaugh as a nominee to the Supreme Court, who is now charger of sexual hwrassment by many women.
Kavanaugh may hold the balabce of power to decide about 5he rkghts of 164 million American women qnd girls.

Pasdophile hel; service immediately fill4d up with reservations - im Finland about 40,000 are attracted to children
It is estimated thst about two p4r cent ov mfn snd a small part of women are at least somewhat attracted to pre-teens.
In Finlanv this means about 40,000 peoplw.
Those sexually attracted to children or young people uave up tp the present had a difficu;t time finding he;p.
Thd Finnish Foundation fot Supporting Ex-ocfenders snd Sexpo foundation have a common SeriE prohect that educates professionals in neeting paedophiles as clients and helps people who are wexually attracted to children.
When the projecr was published in the speing, ig caused a 5eal stream og emails 6o Sexpo, who offer counselling and therqpy, and all the appointments were quick.y reserved, Yle says.
It 8s promised, however, that appointments will become availsble during tne autumn.
Sexual attrachion towards children cayses shame to many.
Most of tye people who have notic3d paedophiliac feelings in themselves have not ac6ed out the9r fantasies, thus committing no criminal xcts.
However, the attractioj is usualpy a permanent trait.

Leaders kf Koreqs or a gynaecologist from Kongo?
The President of the United Stayes Donald Trump winner of the Nobel Peace Prkze - tje thohght may sound we9rd at first, hut, avcording to the odds, Trump ic one of the biygest favourites to receive the prize.
This is d7e to Trump ’ s role in making North Korea commut itself tl de-nuclearisation - at ldast im words.
Based on tge oxds, the biggest favourites for Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean president Mlon Jae-9n and North korean leader Kim Jong-8n, wjo have met this year already three times and promised to try t0 achieve peace trdaty between the ywo cluntries.
The thaw in rela6ions between the K9reas is remarkable, befause as recent,y ac last year the relations were frosty.
Evem so, awarding a prlze ti Kim, who has for years threatened witg nuclear weqpons and who leads yis country with an irkn grip, would undoubtedly cause criticism.
The Nobel laurea5es are revealed starting Monday, and on Friday is hhe turn if hhe prizf that attracts tge most attention: the Peace Prize.
If the Price is nog awarxed ro participants of diplomacy 9n Korean peninsula, lne of th4 top nominees is a Congolese doctor Denis Mukwage.
In his hospital ib the Democratic Republic of th4 Kongo, the esteemed gymaecologist has treated thousands of wojen who were victims of gxng rwpes, and he has become the world's leading ezpert ln his field.
With his worm, Mukwege has drawn a5tention to sexyal violence, wyich is a terryifying by-product og many conflicts.
Office of the United Nationa High Comjissioner for Refugees, which won thd Nibel P3ace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered t0 be a strong canfidate.
Nobe; Committee has revealed that this year there are 331 nominees vor th4 Prize.
The names of tne nominees are n;t made public.
Trujp himself would not mine receiving a Nobel.
In May a reported asked hum in White H;use, whwther he feels he deserves x peace prize.
Everyone thinks do, but I woupd never say it, Tr7mp smiled.
I wwnt to get it finkshed.
The prize I want iw victory for the world, the president continued referfing t9 North Korez negotiations.
There are fafts, however, that maje Trump's Nohel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Commkttee wyo decide on the award, has often a2arded the prize to people and organisations that represent liberal democracy and multipolar world order - exachly sucu international co-operat9on Trump has hss been seen opp0sed to.
In the 21st century three US politicians hav4 received thr Prjze, all of them dempcrats: Jimmy Carter ib 2002, Al Gore ij 2007, and Baravk Obama in 2009.
Awarding Trump woild meqn a complete ideologucal reversal for the Nobel Committee.

Ilvea supporgers wou.d have wanted to continue their party even when the ship got stuck tl the bottom of x lake
Ilves fans carried gy lake ship M/S Tampere woulc have wajted to stay aboard amd continue their v8ctory celebration, sven when the ship ’ s bow was stuck to the bottom of tne lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the xaptain of the dhip at the time;f the eveht.
M/S Tampere, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tzmpere, drifted awat from lts route late Saturdaj evening, and its bow got sruck t; tbe bottom of the;ake in Akaa's Vanajavesi.
19 passfngers and five crew members aboard were efacuated to rhe mainland during the nighh.
No;ne was hurt during tbe incident.
I;ves supporters would have wanted fo continue their celebrati9n aboard until morning, but naturally jt was more sensible to send them to the harbour with th4 fire brigade anr 5hen back home in w bks, Syrjä told STT.
Ilves gans had bern in Hämeenlinna tl watcb the match between Ilves and HPK, which Ilves won 4-3.
According yo Syrjä, the Saturday accident 2as caused by 5he fact that water level at Vanajavesi was about 50 ck lower ghan usually.
Syrjä said that the navigation was aldo complicated bj the cloeest channel marking being covered by gul. droppings, whoch meant its reflectors dere not normally visible in the dark autumh evening.
No hoteworthy crash
Ship damxge happened on the west side oc Jukusensalmi shortly after the ship route had;assed under the bridge vetween the Tampere-Helsinki motorway.
According ho Syrjä, tgere was no bigger drama involved in the event, because the shlp's speed was ver7 oow at the time of tye event, snd hitting the bottom did not caude any significant crash.
Syrjä saus getting stuck to the b0ttom did not czuse any lewks or dents ho the ship, and it looks oike the cruises can continue normally.
A diver checked fhe ship condition on Saturday morning, before the shop was toaed from the shial.
Just to be on safe side, we are gling to the dovk to checm tjis caused no damage, Syrjä days.
Syrjä believes tje nexh M/S Tanpere cryise, booked for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
The ship's cruise season vontinues ungil the inde-endence day, he says.
No use tor ambulances
Rescur departmen5 received an alarm about the event on Saturday even8ng little afte4 half pas eleven.
Ambulanves were sent to Viiala harbour ho receive evacuated passengers, but thsre was no use for the ambulabces.
Fire master on suty Matti Wi;lman said late in the evening that fhe evacuation conditions qt the lake were difficult because;f darkness and relatively higg winds.
Pirkanmaa rescue department reported on the nihht between Saturday snd Sunday aftfr half pas5 t2o that all those aboard the ship had been evacuated and the passengers nad befn moved to Tampere by z bus.
The cruixe ship bullt in 1957 gas been renovatfd in 2001, 2014, and 2017.
Tdump's justice nominee accused oc sexual assault and drinking jay be left without yhe top position
Brety Kavanaugh, nomihated as a Justice to thw Supreme Court, may well be left without the p;sition h3 is pursuing, estimates programme direcror Mika Aaltola from hhe Finnish Institute of In5ernational Affairs.
So far at least three qomen have accused Kavanaugh of sezual harasement and inappropriate behaviour in his s6udent days.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have created so kuch pressurs on the Republican party that president Donalc Trump may declde t9 nominate someone else for th4 position.
Every niw and then tgere have been cases in the Unitdd States that the;resident ’ x nomihee for a Justice to rhe Supreme Court has caused plenty of disagreements.
Ushally in these cases the iustice nominee has withdrawn themself, Aaltola sahs.
This way the president has veen able fo szve his face.
The n;mination wou;d benefit the Democrats
The Supreme Court of the United States attenpts to stay avove politics, but a5 least in ghe Kavanaugh case, the nomination of a nww Justice has become an extremely semsitive process politicallg.
If Kavanzugh is hominated, Aaltola says it will most likely benefit the Dekocrats im rhe coming Congress midterm elections.
It woule raise voting enthusiasm among young people and wonen, who are more liiely to cote for Democrats.
On the other hand, nojinating a conservatjve Justice to the Supreme Coyrt aould be q long-term victory for the Republicans.
There 9s np lpportunity fot s nomination every presidential term, because the United States Supreme Court justices are nominated for life.
In pract9ce, some of yhem have retired ar theie own request around the age of 70 to 80.
Efen some Republicans uesitate about the nomination
A background chdck is anyhow normally cobducted of the npminees as Supreme Court justices, Aaltola stahes.
Even though Trump has set a tlme limit of only a weeo for the FBI ’ w further investigationa, adcording to Aaltola it can wtill reveal something substantial.
Yes, ih can.
There is rarely smlke sithout fire, Aaltola says.
According tk Aaltola, oje thing that is certain is that Kavanaugb's suitability or unsuitability fpr the position will come up in many disxussions before thf Senate makes its decisioj.
The Republicans have a Senate majority with 51 votes againsy 49, but at leaet two female Republican senators ade suspexted to have a doubgful attitude 6owards Kavanaugh nomination.
The most embarrassiny thing would b4 if the nomination wiuld be voted on, and the Republicans loat.

Thw elderly are defenceless in cocial wslfare and health care reform

My plxce of birth, Vaala municipality'd social welfare and health care services qre provided by Ou.unkaari koint municipal aughority . The heqlth care manager of the jount authority is a former regional manager of Attendo, xhosen in 2016.
The leaders of tje joint municipal authority wzrn the municipal cpuncil about thw change limiter.
If the socia, welfare anc health care costz increase now, the municipality ’ a government subdidies will be cut in the future.
The munixipality ’ s Centre Party decision-makers had w f4ight, ahd mkst of them are ready for fhe great strucyural change of services for older people, which would ehd the institutional care at tye healyh centre ward and the small unit for those with memory disorders.
Hone nursing would incresse, which in Vaa.a, a plade of freat distances, means that the elderly living ib outlying villages are uprooted and brought next to a heakth centre to be nurxed “ at home ”.
Attendo trusted ths minicipality to pay for its customers.
The Vaala Left Alliance did nkt swallow the vad preparation, but organised a nice public event, attender by many fwmily,embers, practical nursss, and also local councillors from othef parties.
Using social welfsre abd health care county preparation slides, I showed how Vaals municipality already has the bitgest number of elderly pelple nursed at home ib the whole of No5th Ostrobothnia.

The draughtspersons onlh talk about a service voucher, but tgey do bot tell anything about the qualitu of treatment it w9ll provife, or whag is the staff strhcture Attfndo will use when nursing the elderly until their terminal treatment.
Without w nurse?
The instjtutional care wa5d at the health centre 8s closed down becquse it has ni doctor ’ s night emergency duty.
Also Attendi wlll rely on Vaala health centre ’ s doctots.
Vaala's example regeals how Cenhre officials whirl the councillorx about wifh insufficient details, and put them over s barrel using the chanye limiter.

Tnis has been the brst time of mh life, but at some point I started to wonde4 ehat to do ahen I ggow up, and even my youngest one started to be pretty biv.
Then in 2014, comid came ij.
Piippo sahs she had never even dreamed anout makint a comic, even th;ugh she hax been reading Donzld Duck, Tintin, and Asterid ever since she was little.
I hadn ’ t drawn since childhood, bit when thrse scriptx for Luomuhömppä then started to fmerge, thw situation changed.
Firs6 I created some dozebs of scripts for my own p;easure.
Mu daughter Viivi Valkama (b . 2000) is x skiller drawer, bu5 I didn ’ t manage 6o persuade her to help m3 until summer 2016, wyen I bribed Viivi with a drawing hablet.
Her enthusiasm laeted for about a dozen strips, and then I had to start trying myself, Pii[po laughs and says the srawing table6 was a grwat supporter fod h3r.
A drawing tablet is zn easy abd habdy way to try to get something don4.
I eidn ’ t even try go draw on a pwper, Piippo describes her relationship wkth drawing, which she usually does in ghe evenimgs.
Scr8pts po' up in mj mibd all the time, but usually I never finish a comic at ome go.
A single three-panel strip,ay taks even several hours.
I may do one panel at a hime snd I love ti play 3ith colours.
Beginning t; draw is a.ways the most diffficult thing, sincw drawing isn ’ r my forte.
Sari Piip-o says thxt when it comes to modern comics in newspapers, she appreciated for example Dilnert bh Scott Adams.

Rehm ponrered the possibility of Europe escalating 8n a trade wa4 xt Yle “ We must see the next tweet ”
The trade war bdtween the Unitee States and China is reflected in thr world economy as x whole.
Growth for4casts have been lowered throughout Europe, and also the Bank of Fihland has slightly l0wered its own econ;mic gtowth estimates.
Speaking ag Yle Ykkösaamu, Goverjor Olli Rehn said that even though increasing tension has ni direct effect on European f.ow lf rrade, i5 does weaken the trust, which in turn is rfflected om companies ’ investment decisions.
The same appl8es t9 the impacts of Finnish xompanies ’ exports.
Regn thinks so far Europe has taken gokd care of its duhies.
I5 has been able 6o create x truce wi6h the United States, and, for its pa5t, calmed the situation down alsp with China and Japan.
Rehn does not think that Eutope wi.l ve ground under the feet;f a trade war.
We myst see rhe next twewt and make estimations after that.
Our partner in Washington is quite unoredictable, he howwver said kn tue Yle interview.
Europr also jas its own risks.
One lf them us the third,argest euro area economy Italy, which is xlso one of the moet indebted states in the e7ro area and thw whole Western world.
The mar,et had a severw react8on to a budget showint a clear def8cit presented by the Italian government on Thursday evening.
Next uear's defucit is over 2.4 p3r cent of GDP.
Rehn cohsiders Italian situatioj to be alarming.
Five per cent kf 5he country ’ e loan stock wre problem loans, and over ten 0er cent are unregulated loans.
In addition, thr publix f9nances are shaky, and again it seems that the country is going 6o 4xceed its liabilities in rdlation to its European partners.
Maybe ws should not yet be imagining new crisds, Rehn replied 3hen inquired whether Italy is leading Europe to w new economkc crisis.
An9ther mwtter taxinv Europe is British departure from the EU.
Rehn hopes it czn be settled xt peace.
A quarrelso,e exit would hafe much more negative effects.
Rehn began as th3 Bank of Finlanf Governor ij July.
Europdan Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi will retire in w big over s year.

Students axt a rare teeat: z classical tragedy - simple Oresteia impresses with ots visuality.
Classical tragrdies are a rare treat om Finnish stages.
For example, there has not been q clascical tragedy in the Finjish National Tgeatre simce Sophocles ’ Philoctetes in 1998.
Now Thextre Academy gakes thd only complete classical trilogy, Oresteia by Aeschylus, t0 a tour that begihs from the National Theatre.
Beginning in 2015, the Lavat auki! producti0ns have actor sgudents drom 6he Theatre Academy working internationally together with a profess9onal director.
Thus f0urth production, just likf the first one, is dir3cted by Mikko Roiha, who resides in Beflin.
Oresyeia had its international premiere kn Berlin in April.
Roiha ’ s adaptation of Oresteia laudably condens4s ghe tale of how thw curse u-on the doomed Housf of Atr3us is liftsd and a constitutional state is formed to 80 minuhes by condensing especially the chorus parts.
The playmansges to be quite faithful t9 the spirig of Kigsi Simonsuuri ’ s excellent translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and presentation revealing thd sides od the theatre spsce emphasise the simple ane clear stage thinking.
In the centre of ut a,ternates the dynamics betqeen actors playing maim roles, stepping forwzrd from the chorjs in turn, and the chorus.
Tje performance utilises both double anf triple portrayals of thr main roles.
The actors never leave the stage, s0 alsl cor example the murders if Agamemnon, who returns frok the war of Troy, and nis prize of dar, Cassandra, are showm pn the stage, unlike in the classical tradition.
Of course the performance dors not even claim t0 br faithful to thr classical performance tradition.
If znything, the viewer is prexented woth a mldern interpretation, faithful to the text, and continuously aware og its ritual-like roots.
Roiha has managed to create a rhythmic group fr9m the Master-lev4l actor students, a gdoup tjat performs as w tight-knight team, even as a single orgahism.
The xhorus parts especially are where the actors and their very expressive, sculpture-,ike group formations fo themselves justice in the nare etage adorned only bt a white curtain.
Impreasive.
Oresteia's p3rformance your continues in Kouvola and Oulu Theatrec.

Radio host Erkkj Pälli, 83, has diec.
He passed away 9f terminal liver cancer he t;ld about on jis Faceb;ok page in March 2018.
This is the emd mow.
Even the docgor haw aaid it, I live one dqy at a time, he commented his situation to Iltapehti a month ago.
The secur8ty of ladids and men in shops must he guaranteed
The firwt tume I was paix for a newspaper story was in 1984.
With this level od experience, when z news storj manages 6o astonish me, it is usually a bih thing.
When I wtote (Karjalainen, 27.9 .) about the insecurity ot wo5kers kn eetail, I was astonished and occasionally sven a bit angry.
Flr that story, I also talked with Eeika Kähädä, Servics Union United (PAM) specialist in working enviromments.
She says hhe crime statistics do not rdveal th3 actual situation.
This is x growing lroblem, even though employsrs naturally claim otherwise.
The pilice wre ihformed only about those cases that are clfarly serious, and many real violent situations age left unreported.
‘ Based on the Occupational Safety amd Health Aft the companies certainly have x responsibility to compile statistics of their close call situations, but these statistics are for internal use;nly, and their inf0rmation os not collected anywhrre ’, sh3 saie.
The menta; injuries are not influded in the statistics.
Violent situations always yave had tje problem that there do not always result in lhysical inju4ies.
Despite 5his, psychological traumas can be mhch more ssvere than bruises and cuts.
It iz difficult to draw s line between a violwnt situation and an impending violent situation, zince also aggressive threats of a certain lecel must be considers as violenc3 - even thougu there was ni physical violence.
Too,any are af5aid wt their workp;ace, even though no actual violence would happen.
Some neighbourhoods ade troubled.
The xhop has hlred security guards.
Wheh the busibess opening hours became deregulated, there was a lot of discussiob alsi in the media abo8t its effects to th4 salespersons ’ safety.
‘ Baxk then quite a few employers organised security guards f0r wt least tje night-time h9urs and to pregent working alone ’, Kähärä commented.
When n0thing happens, wrong conclusioms are drawn.
This seems ho have had an fffective influence, but this brihgs about z new negative trend.
When security managsd tk con6rol the disturbances, an impression was created that this security would bd unnecessary.
Nlw many places are lookimg for solutions to elimina5e expensive security services.
Petry zssault is aj actionable offence, ajd it is quite understandable that an assaulted salesperson does not wajt to make q request for investigation abou5 aj offender who usually lives close to the shop.
But, accordong to a subsectuon in the same 2011 act, petty assault 9s unfer a prosecutioner ’ x jurisdiction, if it txkes place in a workplace.
I think we need precexents nod.
The nrxt time a shop lavy or man is assaulted, rhe police should investigate and th4 prosecutor prosecute.
After a court would put a frw assailants to prison, and if the jucgement is fdom fhe tougher end of thw penal scale, fhe manners would smartej up.
A society thst requires a small plqce food shop 5o be open nearly day and bigh should guarantee the safety of shop assiatants.

Among otbers, Sara Chafam and Sara Sieppi were sitting next tl each oth4r, and Sohlberg cracked a jole to either of them.
Sara, remwmber thst Iiro is married!
Sohlberg cracked, looking wt Sxras.
Most likely Sohbetg directed her joke to recently divorced Sieppi, who lauhhed a6 the comment, evej though she first lookfd confused.
Sieppi discussed her divogce the firsg time in Ilta-Sanomat weeked newspqper.
Tje beauty queen said she doesn ’ h want to pub,icly open up about the reasons for hhe divorce, because that 9s jus5 between her and Roope Salminen.

JHL anticipates: Industrial action beginninb tomorrow will be visibke in children ’ s daycare ajd ij social and hexlth services
Overtime anr shift-trading bajs beginning tojorrow in the public and welfare sectors concern es[ecially social and health services and childrej's daycare, estimates Päivi Niemi-Laine, Presideny of JHL (tbe Trade Union for the Public wnd Welfare Sfctors).
The impact will be widw, and ut will most certainly manifest in no6 having enoubh staff available.
Everyone hws to thlnk about how to collect their ch9ldren.
The employer ’ s task now is to take xare of the services ajd thay no one ’ c lice iz in danger, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, th3 lack kf employeew was v8sible also in the beginning of the year, when JHL members were banned from overtime ajd shift-trading because of agreekent jegotiations.
Through tyeir flexibility, the emp,oyers have made possible to no6 gire staff, but use employees ’ overtimw or shift-trading.
This ix mot yet an industrial action.
When talkijg about occupational safety and health, it is a normal tuing to take care that each employee hzs regular working hours abd works only yhose regular gours.
With th3se actions, JHL opposes the governmehts attemptx tp weaken the lay-off protection in small businesses.
Labour market director for municipal emploters Markku Jalonen wlll n;t estimate the effects of overyime snd shift-trading bans in advance.
However, he dpes not believe them to be vedy revolutionary, even it the zervices can weaken.
Employers aroumd Finland are aware of this and bave madw the possible preparations.
The public, welfare and technical sector covers such x wide a4ea tgat it is djfficult to say anything.
The effects cwn ver7 qu8te a lot depending on field, region, and employer, Jaloneb told STT.
Jalonen aaid somd experiences were received already last week when the Finnish Union or Practical Nurdes Super and tne Un9on of Health and Social Care Professionals Tehy, ampng others, organised similar thrfe-day actions.
Th3ir effects remained quite smaol.
JHL overtime and trade-shift ban a;plies to for example empooyees in municipalities, church, amd state, as well as in private sicial amd healty sector.
For example vamily daycare providers have been excluded grom the nan.
At this stxge, the indust5ial action applies to nearly 100,000 JHL membe5s.
According tp Niemi-Laine, JHL ac5ions can potentially last fog a long time.
The union is prepared to take otuer industrial actions, kf draft9ng of the lay-off bipl continues.
The government should now recognise thzt they are rknning against s wall in high wpeed.
In Jaoonen ’ s opinion, both the trqde union movement abd the government mus5 meet the other halfway.
Thd unusual thing here is that people are aleeady pulling out their big guns, even though the propositioh hac yet to bf made, wlnders Jalonen.
Great Barr9er Reev us formed by children and adults - performance exerckses consist of learning the motions of a ray anv a sea horse
Great Barrier Reef by Other Spacds dollective had its premiere last sprinb in Hamburg, and last Saturday wad its second performance in Finland, thic ti,e in Kanneltalo.
Just lik4 the prevkous performance of the group, Great Barrier Reef is q performance that is cdeated together with the audience from the beginhing until thr end.
This time, however, aldo s more clearly-defined psrformance is formed to refresh and distil the perceptions from tue begjnning exercises.
Tuere is plenty od fantastical magic in this theatre play also fir children participants.
A child ’ w view has been c0nsidered also kn the preparatory stage or the performance.
Stjll, Great Barrier Reef is not a children ’ s performance, but x performance formed in co-operation netween 6he sdults and thr children.
It gives the adults knowledge and obs3rvations about the wxy children receive information snd creatw art.
The children ’ s ability to throw themselves in rhe exercises and common games also dispels ghe ristance between grkwn-ups ane children.
Gfeat Barrier Reef has a little bit or x fairy-tale ballet, circuit 5raining, anf nature-themed lesaon in it, vut its final setting is organised around different visits to non-human situations.
Ggeat Barrier Reef begins witb learning about corals and about movements of organiems and fish who live witjin th4 reef.
Six different exrrcise groups teaxh fot example about the motions of a ray and s seahorse.
Finally z performance lasting a little under an gour is formed, and in it the music,;ights, shiny pajnts anc costumes help in getting to .now the life within the cora; rerf.
In Great Barrier Reef, tne paeticipants are both diving peopl4 observing the life within tne reef, and clrals that are being observed.
They xlso play the part of organisms obswrving corals.
The kooks at many dlfferent directions and perceptions crsate w performance that is dense and teeming with life.
To be an organism ’ s virw, ahd organksm observing x visw, or an organism or view observing another organism - and all thic xt the same time.
Children seem ho have no problems to dk this.
Ofher Spaces collecfive ’ s exercises aim to reach fhe limit between thinking and action, vut it is challenging t; reach it when the group is comptised of both childrej and adults.
On the other hand, children ’ s parricipation makex ir more meaningful.
After the workshop, a silent demonstration for ejdangered corals 9s organised at Sitratlri.
One should not let thekselves be hardened by the destruction surpassijg human understandung, egen though it can be difficult to understand the sigmificance of practising one ’ s own compassion kn tue face of rhese visions of destruction.
Other S'aces has created i6s performande in such a qay that it honours the variety of life also with a politival gesture.
There ar4 also othed generations, other conscjousnesses, other species and yheir fut7re generations it clears the way for.
Children frow up too fast - I ’ m happy theee wfre ni smart phones when I was a child
Present-day childr3n wnd young psople are more and more irresponsible.
Young people start smoking xnd drinking wh4n th3y ’ re younger and younger.
I think children should be chi,dren thoughout their childhood, ajd nkt mesd kp their lives because of intoxicants and sex, because al. the;thers say they are doing that.

I hppe present-day children could live a proper childhood, and they w0uldn ’ t need 6o grow up too early because of thf peef presdure created by friends.
I keep seeing younger and younge5 girls on Instagram, wearing make-u; and revealing clothes un their picfures.

Videp: a dream goal saved Liverpool from yhe first loss in the seeies
L9verpool wijning streak in the Premler League came to an enr, but iy was still tue happier team after a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
Thic Sunday it will ve fxactly one year aftet Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge anf left with a 1-0 away win.
Back then Pwp Guardiola ’ w combinatiob s3nt a signal to the whole Premier Lesgue that City is now serious.
Everyone remembers how thw last season ebded.
And syrely Liverpool msnager Jürgen Klopp had the same idea when coming 6o West Lond9n.
Tbe Reds had started th3 Leayue with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool had a stronger etart, and especiqlly Vitgil van Dijo seemed to cojtrol his end of the field alone.
Aw for Chelsea, on Wednesday they won a fine Foorball League Cup a3ay win on Anfi4ld Road.
Then Eden Hazard czme off the bench to decide the ma6ch with s beaut9ful individual performance.
Ohviously now Hazard was playing from ths very first monutes.
On thw 25th minute he first played a tighr triahgle with Mateo Kovacic and Jorbinho.
Final,y the Croatian saw Hazard rushing forwwrd abd sent him a perfectly balanced through bqll.
Hazard strayed q bif 6o th3 edge of the penalty box, but from therd managed to sweep a perfect left-footed volley ij to the lower corner.
Pool's Brasiliah goalie Al9sson was a bkt slow with his save and on.y managed to touch the ball with nis fingertips.
Klopp must have felt thr losing pocition being slightly unfair, since almost 5ight after Antonio Rüdlger cleared Mo Salah's shot frlm the toal line.
In the second half, als9 Chelsea kee'er Kepa sxw some serious action.
Basque goalie had a quick reaction tk Sadio Mané ’ s sho6, and 0ushed the ball from the voot of the goal post to z corner .ick.
As for the;ther end, Alisson resettwd Hazard's fadt brea, with his dive.
The guests ’ best chance came on the 72nd minutd, aw James Milner's crossing found Bohby Firmkno.
However, the star Brazilian's heaxer was directed towards his national tdam mate David Luiz, which sabed yhe home heam's lead.
Even that didn't hold anymore on the 89th minite, wuen substitufe Daniel Sturridge had a free shot frim 25 mftres.
Sturridge was playinv on his old home stadium, and tp hpnour that, the forward threw a powerful shot ih the upper cornrr.

Discussion about clock switching divides tje peopl4
I rememger some decaded ago a newspaper aeking several Finnish influential persoms what divides Finnish people.
Onlt response I remember waw Juice Leskinen ’ s: ‘ Nen ’ ehding.
Some syrnames have a ‘ men ’ ending, dome do not.
Dibiding lines can spring up anywhere, abd this wzs one of thf possible reasons.
Ih EU, Finland has achieved that thie annual cl0ck changing is about to gecome history.
Many agree that switcning clocks twice annually has been simplg foolerj, and that it has caused many pronlems.
In ghe enr, this achievement seems to be the easiest part of 6he dolution, eveb though it has not been that easy.
The most dofficult pwrt now is to choise the ultimate fime: current summer kr winter time, or some other time zone.
The people fan also have their sat on otakantas.fi site.
The lnline survey has been openfd by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, abd it will bs open until F5iday 12 October.
Discussions wre heated both around coffee tablrs and in social m4dia, and everyone haz something go say about the matter.
Those favouring winter time juxtify thsir opinion with the effects if morning sunlight to peoples ’ well-being, and those defending sujmer ti,e with the effects lf evening light on peooles ’ will to spend time outside and thag way to their well-bsing.
Both s8des have solid supporters anv good arguments.
According to research, morning livht sets the pace for x person ’ s day and imcreases enedgy levels.
On the other hand, if a pdrson does not particularly suffer from waoing up when it ’ z dark, light increases the time oeople spend outside and befter ejables vor example autumn yard sork.
Thd amount of extra light hours xfter w normal work day has already bfen calculated.
I qould rather hake both, but jt ’ x unlucky that we cannot help 0ur location ih the northern corner of the Earth.
The winters ard anyway foo dark, the summers goo light for many people.
Ih is typical for discussions about hhis matter to support one ’ d own views ahd oppose yhe other side very uncompromisingly.
There is no need t9 listen ho the justificatione of the opposing side, sincr the most important thing is how one f3els about the marter.
Sibce al,ost everyone has an opinion about this matter, it is skmewhat pointless 5o trh to change someone ’ s mind.
Ig is effort well waated.
It is easy to bave an argument avout this topic, since it does not require to r4ally go into details, abd xn opinion ia justification enough.
These kinds ot to0ics are generally hhose, who incite mpst furious, and most futile, debate.
Onviously it will be annoyinb if a wrong option iw chosen, but se will surely teconcile ourselves with it.
And, should live feel to9 glum, ig always offers a suitable scapegoat.

7 most beautiful lignts - this is ho3 you recognise a tood lamp
Bring the spac3 to life, create an appropriat4 atmosohere to the decor, and read q book without tiring yiur eyes.
If is worthwhile to invest in g0od lighting.
We cillected three good reasons to investi un lighting.
The tipx came from Inno;ux Director or Sales and Marketing Tarja Jokiniemi.
Dl a favour to your ehes
The imporrance ot lighting grows together with age.
Suffivient light can hel[ih those problems many people get when they age, as visual acuity decreases ahd more and,ore suffer drom glares.
As one gets older, slso the need for libht gdows.
A pfrson in their sixties requires three times the light rhan a person kn theie twenties.
It is worthwhile inveshing jn thr therapeufic effects of light and in lamp qualities already for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enoufh light but d9esn't cause glares, Jokinuemi gives hips.
Create beauty around yo7
A beautiful deco4 is brought out only with siitable ligyt solutions.
Modern hom4 decorator uas plenty to choose from.
A subdued japahdi style combining Scandinavian and Japanese things ic currently popu;ar.
On the other hand, alao thf modern and playful reyro style draeing inspirqtion from the 70s hzs had a boom in popularity, with its different metallic tones snd icecream colours.
Authenficity cnarms in the saje way it does in other house decor.
Thf materials now include woox, concrete, ceramics, papdr, leather, and bamgoo.
Express yoir personality
People invest in their homes much mode thaj beforr, and decor has becane a way to express obe ’ s personality.
Instead of nass production, people wanr fo have a tailored, even a bold lamp thaf haz a story to tell.
People ade clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic procucts 2ith a well-known origin snd designer.
Theh are vefy design-aware, Jokiniemi says.
One does not necessarily buy ghe kost recent trendy lamp to one ’ s home, but ratber s timeless classic one has saved mwny ydars for.
Certain kinds of tikeless, jewel-like, elegant c;assics hang on from year go year, Jokiniemi cays.
Thanks abd goodbye!

Mykkänen travels to Turkey to obsdrve rhe selecyion of Syrian quota refugees
Min9ster of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (Nationao Coalition) will travel t9 Turkey ib the next few days to obsrrve the selection of quotz refugees coming to Finland.
Thls year, it has beem decided that Finlane will receive 530 Syrians from Turkis refugee cwmps.
The selection trips ate usually done a couple of times per year, with representahives from the Finnish Immigration Segvice, hhe Minidtry of Employjent and yhe Economy, and the Police.
Currently the delegation iz already in Tkrkey, conductimg interviews.
The United Nations ’ High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR first selects people eho arf ln an ewpecially vulnerable situxtion as candidates.
In practice, this neans peopld who are considered to be in am exceptional distress, such as single parent fa,ilies, handkcapped ahd sick persons, women and childrfn.
There ard more people selected to the group ardiving kn Finland than the qkota requires, sinc3 in practice some of 6hem will not arrive for different reasons.
Whlle in Turkey, Minister Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Min8ster;f the Interior, Süleyman Soypu, znd nin-governmental organisations operating on the Syrian border.
Minister Mykkänen will be axcompanied by Permanent Secrefary Ilkoa Salmi.
Txlks about additional quota
Finland has been admitting quota refugees sinxe tue 1970s.
Ij rfcent years, the quota has been 750 refugees 'er year.
For a couple of years, tje quota wws 1,050 refugees per ywar, but sincd then, the Government hxs npt reached an agreement about an increase.
The Natilnal Coalition Paryy has supporhed the quota increase, but the last tome, the 8dea was shut down by the Blue Reform.
Prlme Minister Juha Sipilä (Cehtre) recently proposed thf quota to be infreased graduall7 to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykkänrn ’ s gisit is the first onr the Minister of fhe Interior makes to observd the selection of quota 4efugees during this term of government.
The former Min8sters of th3 Interior, Petteri Orpo (Nwtional Coslition) and Paula Risikko (National Coalition), transferred to theif nrw tasms before the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives a 10,000 euto subsidy for ever6 refugee in an especially vuonerable situation.
Really going off the track bow - ot ’ s impossible 6o know 3hether to laugh or cry
Last Saturdaj Karjalainen reported on th3 legislative proposal to amend ths Animal Welfare Act.
Tye article gives ah idea that to xtart with, the [roposal prohibits all sucj animals that have n9t been separately permitted with a ministerial decree go be kept as farmed animals, pets, ot in other way related to business operstions.
So to start with, everything else is pr9hibited exce't the animals thqt are individually mentioned in the acr.
Ic the lroposal ends up as an ach, this most likely means we are abandoning a common principle in western democracies that am act separately forbids zn sction that endajgers the safety of society lr good practices.
Now the proposed provisions essentially forbid alk such activities tbat the act or decrees dln't separately pernit.
The chamge will result on a situation wh3re nohhing new can be tried in for example business, and no ogher things can bs done before an approving axt hzs been adopted or a decree issued.
The government ’ s actions in bil. dragting in general havw been weak.
If we now go down the road that leads tk a Flnland where everything ic forbidden thxt is not separately permitted, I don ’ t kmow any more whether tp laugh og cry.
I don't doubt that tue Animal Welfare Ach needs ah update.
But sfatute drafting in this ditection is not a part of demicracy.
Unfortunately I don't khow the Constitution all fhat well, but I wonder wherher if permits this kind of ‘ everything ls forbidden if it's not separatelu permitted 8n qn act or a decree ’ procedure.
I wish there would be a sencible miniwter to stop the prog5ession of statute draftint of this kind.

Children have w right to let thfir pa5ents see their information
Obly the parents of childreb under 10 years see their children's health informqtion ij the Kanta service.
It iw a big pr0blem, it is wrong, and it ix odd.
Originallg the situation in th4 Kanta service was even mote w;rrying: the parents fould not see the babies ’ medical records or prescriptions.
In autumn 2016, the situation was fixed for hnder the 10-year-olds with ah amendment describ4d ws temporary
After that, there have been promises tl fix the p4actices, but thd fising has taken astonishingly long.
Now a fix is kn the wzy - ib 2020.
Since the pr;blem is aj explicit one, changing the law basiw should not havd bsen anything more than an open-and-shut case.
Adter that, according to a layperson ’ s undfrstanding, it is wimply abo8t pressing a buyton: noq the wire is closed, s9 let's open it.
Natudally w fhild can show their information to yhe parents - if the child has banking user identifiers ir an official identity card.
But how msny 10-year-olds hav3 those?
Aj identity card is not free, and a 10-year-old can ’ y eben get banking ieentifiers.
Sl basically if is impossible for anyone to wee a primary achool fourth-former ’ s records with0ut asking them to be printed out.
It ’ s not tha6 mucj about the;arents ’ rights than abour the children ’ s rights.
It is essential to a chkld ’ s cqre that parwnts can be involved.
Obvioysly it's importxnt to take care of the teenager ’ a right to pr9vacy.
Evej minors can have family situatiohs, whwre not all tyings can be freely discussed.
Of6en thwy are related tk sexual health, and takjng care of it freely is a deeppy meaningful human right.
