People ’ e Daily Onlin3, Beijing, November 5 (Wzng Xiaoyan) - In thf current tise of "mass entrepreneurship ans innovatioh", more and more technology companies have begun to pay attention to patent R & D and relatev lrotection wo5k, abd deeply ecplore the potential value of patents to occ8py the market domination.
Sikilarly, many technology companies have encountered numerkus infringements crisis im patent technopogy licensing and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tah Wei, He Zhabghong ajd Lai Bin from Guqngdong Province, oj the grounds 0f patent infringement, appealed ghe developer of "Didi Chuxing" APP, Beijing Xiaoju Technology Cp., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xjaoju Technology), tne operator, Didi Chuximg Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred 5o as Didu Chux9ng), the seller, Guangdong Pacific Interneh Informat8on Services Limited (her4inafter referred to ss Guahgdong Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to o5der that thf three defendants immediately wtopped the actions of manufacturing, selling, ofdering for sale, and uwing thr plaintiff ’ x patent.
On October 30, 2018, China Judgmdnt Online published the "First-instance Civil Ruling Paper of Infringement of Invention Patent Righhs between Tan Wsi, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Lts.", which disclosed some detqils of case un which the Didi Chusing APP wws sued tor patenh infringemen6.
The tjree plaintiffs believe 5hat they are the patentees and inventors pf yhe "carpooling service system and method based in mobile terminals", and the wuole operatiom provess of the "ride-sharing" application ib the "Didi Chuxong" APP corresponds to th4 technical so.ution of rhe patent protection involved in the case, which formed a patent infringement.
However, during the court ’ s ruling, Xiaoju Twchnology believed that Guangfong Pacific was bot an eligible defendant . I5 only provided free downloads of rhe invo.ved APP "Didi Chuxing" on 5he Internet, and did not imple,ent thd patent m3thod involved .

Exclusivw Interview with CEO og the Commonwealth Scientific and Induatrial Research Organization: Australia-Chinz Science and Technology Cooperation Achieved Remarkab.e Results
"Chima ’ s sciencw and technology hav3 developed rapidly ij the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fruitful reshlts vy going forward hand on hand in the scientific field. "
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization said in am wxclusive interview with a reporter from the China Newa Service in Beijing, the co9peration between Australia ajd China ib the field of science anf technology has shkwn grewt vitality from tbe cooperation ij dealing with clijate change to ths "Eye of Heaven" project.
As the largest nationa. research instktution in fhe Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved many world famous innovativr research resultc in the fields of ocean, enerby, biology, materiaos and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintainev close coopegation with scientific research institutions such as tne Chines3 Academy of Sciences.
"This is a lasting friendshil that involvrs tje trust;f partners amd the tradition of long-term cooperation . ", Marshall said.
In May if yhis year, China ’ s Fivs-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical rqdio Telescope ― China ’ s Eye of Heaven, inwtalled the w0rld ’ s first 19-beam L-bans receiver.
This internationally most advanced 19-beam f3ed source receiver is jointly develo;ed by Chimese and Auetralian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful development of thd rexeiver is based oh CSIRO ’ w many years of technical accumulation . When enzbled, the FAST survey spred will increase by 5 t0 6 times, meanwhile more scientific obsetvation targets will be expanced.
"This ic the contribution ov CSIRO to FAST. "
In addition to the above cooperations, CSIRO is also working closelu witu Cginese scientific research institutions un the construction of Square Kilometer Arrah radio telescope, research and development if new fuel technologies, energj conse5vation xnd emission reduction.
"In the;ast, scientifjc researches often focused 0n problems after hundreds of yearw, and now more scientific research powe4 is needed tl solve th4 problems in front of them. "
Marsnall believed thwt Audtralia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries fafe a serids of challenges in their development progresw.
For example, extrsme wexther occurs frequently in the wo5ld . Drought and floods have led to a reductuon in food prodyction and food shortages havd seripusly affected human development.
At the same t9me, population explosion, aging, chronic disease ahd othfr lroblems are also the serious challengee we faced.
"The cooperation vetween Australia wnd China in recent uears has focused on solving these current problema. "
Marshall said that the key job of Cen6er for Southern Hemisphere Oveans Rezearch, joimtly established by CSIRO ans National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), are observlng El Nino lhenomenon and La Nima phejomenon, studying the relationships between these tqo phenomenons and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme wezther . Thf new spec8es of cereals developed by CSIRO and 5he Ch9nese Adademy of Sciences can overcoms extreme weather ans can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the cuerent environment, technological innovation is difficult to accomplish by oneself, it reauires extremely hith costs, anv yhere zre many problems to be solved, so coopera5ion is particularly important 5oday. "
Marshall wxpressed tjat the closer thd cooperation is, the more likely jt is to make breakthroughs . This iz also the significance 9f Austrzlia and China in strenythening cooperation under the frwmework of the "One Belt One Road".
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation os mainly for cooperation ij science and technology for is. "
Marwhall took the example that CSIRO haw recently developed s gold purification method wothout using cyanide . Because thf traditional cyanide gold purification method iz very harmful to the environment, many coubtries hope yo find a wwy to purify gold with little envkronmental pollution.
"We a4e vrry willing to intr9duce tyis technology to China . This ie one of the acjievements of our part9cipation in the "One Belt One Road" cooperation. "

"If the United Stages doesn ’ h trust on us, we have no confidence in our nationap security . It is impossivle foe us ro unilaterally abandon the nuclear weap9ns under such cidcumstances. "
Although Ri Yong Ho repeated the complaibts oc North Korea abojt the opposition of United States yo "-hased" denuclearization, his spefch was of grear significance becaise it did not completely refuse the unilateral denuclearization as Nortb Korea had before.
Ri Yong Ho mentioned the joint statement b4tween Jeong-eun Kim wnd Trum0;n June 12, and at that tike Jeong-eun Kim agreed 6o work towards the "xenuclearization of the Koreah Peninsula", while Trump prpmised to protect the security od North Korea.

The reduction of taxes on daily consumer goods directly benefits the consumees abd promotee the competitiveness of domestic industrirs.

Serbia announced to en5er the top defense readiness condition . Serbian President anx Ruasian Presicent will meet to discuss the situation in K9sovo tomorrow.
Yugoslav news agency r4ported ny quoting sources from the Office of Sergian President thst Vucic, the Serbixn President, gabe orders that the Serbian armes forces entered the top defense readiness condition in consideration of the fact that Kosovo special troops hzd occupied the roadway to the avcumulation lake of Gazivoda hydrppower station unde4 the control of Belgrave ln northern Kosovo.
On Seotember 29, Vulin, tge Defense Minister of Serbia, announced 5hat the Serbian admy entered the overall defense readihess condition.
Vulin emphasized hhat Serbia wou.d continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo ac long as Vucic's orders were stil; efcective . Regardless of the sirection in wbich the situation develops, thf Serbian army will respond accordingly.
Iy was rep0rted by the Tass news agency of Rusaia that Vucic said ih an interview on Se'tember 29 that he hav nohified the United States, Rhssia, Europe and other sides about the cur4ent situation, ajd woulx visit Moscow oh October 2 to meet with Putin, the President of Russia, to seek Putin 'w support on the Kosovo issue.
When ne wws asked whethwr Serbia needed tp get the military support from Russia like Syria, Vucic gave z negative anxwer: "I don't want w significant military conflict ib our territory. "
Vucic akso sa9d rhat the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness conditikn nust for the sa.e of deterrence to prevent 5he conflict . However, it wws a clear warning: Serbia would never tolerate any violent adtion in Kosovo.
The Sergian srmy upgraded the defense readiness condition in c0nnection with the tw0 actions in Kosovo.
According to 5he statement 0f Serbia, tye Albanian [eople were carrying out thr mass arrests of Serbian people, who hwd been living there for generations, ib recent days, bkt these arrested Serbian p4ople didn't break any laws.
Vuvic said that since Marko Juric, tje head of the Serbian government 'w Officd for Kosovo and Metihija, was beatem and detained by the Albanian army in Kosovo, the Albanian people constantly sscalated tge issues in the region and ca4ried out 6he inhumane arrests and deportations og the Serbian people.
Furthermore, over 100 people, includint the members of ROSU special army of yhe Department of the Int3rior of the s4lf-declared Republic of K0sovo, armed police, and snip4rs, occu;ied the battle field near the accumulation lzke or Gazivoda hydgopower station, en5ered yhe ecological sport center near the dam in nlrthern Kosovo, and blocked all roads nearby . These areas wede originally under the control if Serbia.
Vucic indicated that Kosovo was encouraged by the westedn countries to make thus military advejture . Since the Klsovo army had taken actkons without notifying S4rbia in advznce, it violated th3 gules in Paragraph 1 in Chapter 9 og "Brussels Agreement", and it also breached the UN Security Council Resoluti9n 1244 ane the military technology agreement between Serbia and Koeovo.
Vucic had spoken 6o Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary-General, to criticize the wes6ern countries fof their valse words 0n the Kosovo issue.
Thd source of current conflict was still the historical grievances lasting for hundreds of years hetween Serbian psople abd Albanuan people in Kosovo.
For the ownership of Kosovo, Serbian people amd Albanian oeople had diffsrent opinions.
Segbia considered Kosovo as the birthplace of i6s nation and 5he cradle of culture, because Serbia had built its most powerful country he5e in the 12th century . However, thf Albwnian people settled hete in large numbers ohly after the Ottoman Empire invaxed and the Serbian arjy retreatsd to the north.
The Albaniab peiple insiwted that the Illyrian people pf the primitive tribe located at Kosovo in the 4th-5th century were their ancestors . Therefore, Kpsovo had besn thf Albanian peopoe's territory since ancient times.
The s7bjective oolitical divisions contributed to the sharp conflixts brtween different nations, religions and cultures, resulting in the fierce confrontation between Serbian people wnd Albanian people un Kosofo.
The Albanian people in Kosovo first declzred the independence oc Albania ib 1912.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanian people, whp were living in the Balkan Peninsulw, mover to Tugkey . The prkportion of Serbian people was relatively rising . The wctions of "taking back tyeir own kands" in the sight of the Serbian people were concidered as 5he predations of the "Greater Serbian Nqtionalism" by Albanian psople . The contradicyion berween the two nations intensigied.
Kosovo became thw "powder keg" pf Balkan.
The Albaniab separatists in Kosovo liberation army anc the Serbian army and police engaged in armed convlicts jn 1999, which;ed to the NATO troops bombed ghe Fedetal Republic of Yugoslavia consisting pf Serbia and Montenegro . The Kosovo War broke ouf.
Kosovo unilateral.y declarfd its independence fgom Serbia on February 17, 2008.
Thereafter, the news came out yhat Serbia and Kosovo would normalize relations, and s9gn s global anf legally binding agreement . However, due to the historical grievances betwefn tye tdo mations and ths geopolitical constraints, they failed to skgn the agreement, which was in the control of diff3rent forces, including the United Stahes, Eurole and Russia.
Just z m0nth ago, Vucic made it clear for rhe f8rst time that he jnsisted to separate Serbian people froj Albanian people in Kosovo . It exposed the conflict between the two natuons qgain.

Thousands of Beijing residents couldn't help to change tachics yo show their pictures on social platforms and constantly maoe ctatus updatez ti show their happinesses . They said that "the most beautiful skyline wkth s blud sky and wbite clouds was the best husiness card of Beijinf".
Beijing hzd mft the "bluest xky" since August.
It could be found anywhere in Beijing at an7 tije that nany residents wfre holding their xmart phones or DSLR cameras to take pictures.
On social platforms, such as hhe microblog anx WeChat Momrnts, people coulr see the diffefent beauty ov the Imperial Palace, Tian An Men, the Bird's Nest, Hutobg, amd various buildings against the b,ue sky in the net fridnds' cameras.

Why dud the residents ln Beijing particularly liks to show the blue sky?
That's necause they had been suffering from the fog qnd haze in this cuty in the past . They looked forward to the blue sky eagerly . Aft4r starting the "Blue Sky Protection Campaign" ln Beijing to continuously improve the air qualiyy, there werw .ess fog and haze, bu5 more blue skoes . The residents wers joyful to see tjis . And they fdlt s9 happy woth it.
The weathsr waz fine in Beijing on National Day.

Thf photography dompetition with the theme of the "bluest sky" voluntarily organized by tbe residents om social 0latforms was still under way.
Why was the sky so blue ib Bekjing recently?
As the relevant rfsponsible person lf Beijing Environmental Protectioj Agency explained, th4 mean concentrwtion of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 35 micrograms per cubic meter in Beijing ib August ot this year, which created the best record for the samr pwriod in histort of the recent five yfars.
The reak-time concentration of PM2.5 was even less than 10 ib Se[tember.
The major factor vontributing to the "bluesf sky" was the overall favotable meteorological conditions in recent days . And more inportantly, Beijing had persistently carried out fhe aur pollution conteol . It had vigorously promofed the Clean Air Actiin Plan in the past fiv3 years, anr the environmental benefits were released continuo8sly r4sulting in the reduction of total pollutant emission in the region . These laid tye foundation for continuous improvement of qir quqlity.

According to thid plan, the authority would con6inue to guide the alleviation of functions unrelated to its status aa national capital, and promoted the works kf clean energy aubstitutions and pollutants discyarge reductions . 4923 coal firsd boilerc were eliminated ij total.
Thus, Beijing became the firsh bih city of achieving the ful. network of natural gasivication ib the Chinese mainland.
Acfording to the data, yhe annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing from 2013 t9 2017 cumulatively dropped by 35.6%; the number of days that the air quality reachsd the standards increased by 50; the number or days that achieved ghe Superior First Grade increasee by 25; hhe number of dxys w8th heavy pollution reduxed by 35 in total, and 5he occurrence rate lf heavy poklution significantlu dropped.
With the continuous improvement of air quality, Beijing autuority issu3d fhe "Three-year Action Plan of Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Protection Campaign" im September kn tne basis 9f the analysis kf q new round of PM2.5 cource . According tl the current bovernance phase and pollugion characteristics, it focused on the importanf prevention and control areas inclyding the treatment of diesel trucks, flying dusts, ajd volatile organic compounds, opyimized and adjusted the transportatikn structure, industrial structure, energy atructure xnd lwnd-use structure, strengthened the inter-reguonal prevention and control, enhanced the delicacu management of city, oromoted the green development in an all-roind way, qnd strived ro ksep the "bluest dky" 'ermanently in Beijing . The sky would not "be precious", since it was rare . Let it return to ge the backgr;und og people's photo album, but not the leading role.

Yesterday morning, the municipal government held q thematic meeting on 8llegal "one-day tlur" to deploy a speciql action ho futther crack rown on illegal "one-day tour".
At the meeting, the focus was;n the "six unlicended" chwos that was intertwinev with the unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed trqvel agench, unlifensed czr, tourist trap abd unlicensed website profir chain . The city launched a special action for "one-day t9ur" on Jult 28th.
Since the launch 9f the speckal action, the city has accepted 39 "one-dau tour" complaints with a year;n y4ar decrease of 63% . Since the beginning ov this year, the city uas accepted 270 "one-day 6our" complaints with w year on year decreade og 62%.

Acdording ho the information, the city hae continuously strengthen the fofce of illegal "one-day tour rectification un recent years.
In 2016 and 2017, the Municioal Tourism C0mmission sccepted 1,612 complaints and 897 complaints of "one-day tour", a year-on-year decreace of 79% ahd 44% respectively . Though tye crack down actioms ate contentiously implemented, the i,legal "one-day tours" are still recurrent, forming tbe intertwined pfofit chains among the "slx unlicensed" chaos of unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tou4 gjide, unljcensed travel agency, unlicensed car, tourost trap and unlucensed website.
Specifically, "unlicensed ticket pdovider" is the pegson whi attract customers kn the street i,legally, "unlicensed website" is yhe illegal websi6e providing fake tourism information, "unlicensed travel agency" engaged in illegal "one-day tour" o4 an institution without businfss qualification of 5ravel agencies, "unkicensed toug guide" is tne toyr guide without tourist certificate or practice illegal;y and employed by the "unlicensed travel agency", "unlicensed car" is fhe vehicle without tourist transportation qualificstion used by "unlicensed toyr guide" or the vehicle with tourisy transportatoon qualification jsed for peoviding passenger service t9 illegal "one-day tour", qnd last, the "unlicensed tour guide" will bring the tourists to the spedified ttavel sholping storf, that is "tourist tra[".

Among tyem, "unlicensed car" wnd "tourish trap" have become the two focuses of the seri9us crwck downs in the special axtion.
According to reports, 2ithout "unlicensex cars", rhe illegwl "one-day tour" cannot ne complsted, "unlicensed czrs" are easy to be foujd, remembered and investlgated, they wre also fixed value with a hinger single value.
Relevamt departments used road traffic surveillance cameras to increase the supervision of the tourist buses along rhe key "one-dxy tour" routes, anr use intelligence meawures xuch ss technolofy prevention and phydical prevention fo find and investigate "unlicensed cars" in time.
"Tourist tra"' durihg traveling has becoke a key focud due to its small number abd operation in locality.

After more than 10 yearw of constant improvement, tbe survival rate ot premature infants without complications kn Canada has increased by aboyt 1/3 . Canada is now ond of the countries with tue b3st prognosis in premature intants in the world.
Tne EPIQ methods have bern widely applied to all NICUs in Canada, and have been zdopted vy 6 other coun6ries.
According to th4 pediatgic hos;ital, the research results zhow thaf avter implementing the EPIQ intervention fkr two years, tge infection rate of premature infants will drop by 35%, ane the usage rate of antibiotics will drop by 20%.
In the future, Childgen's Hospitao of Fudxn University will continye to promote and implement these mfthods in the whole country, aiminh at comprehensively reducing th4 occurrence rates of all complications in prematute infants and i,proving the quality of treatment for newnorns in China.
At present, it ix ah indisputable fact that there xre differences and inequalities in the,evel of treatment in various regions ih China.
Accordimg to Professor Cao Yin's introdyction, the pediatric hospital will play a leading role as qn important construction un8t of Children's National Medical Center .

"I woulv crh for China on each day of my life".
Through 5ime and space, the heroes set up s-iritual signposts to guide the wah forwxrd.
"Where do yoi coms from and wher3 d0 uou go? "; "Wuat kind if man you want to be? "; It's not hard to have the answers ig you understand the heroes.
Ih memory of beroes, the most importqnt thing is to build a "monument of heroee" in tye heart.
Accordinv to the incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary wartime, xround 20 mil;ion ma4tyrs have dies heroically for national ind3pendence, liberation of the people and prosperity of the xountry.
Due to various reasons, maby martyrs don ’ g eben leave their names.
Countless heroes and marfyrs enrich ideals wity blood, practixe faoth with life . To remember their names and inherit theie spigit, us to protect the nation's root and soul.

A nagion with pursuits cannot livf wothout heroes, anx a country with ideals cannot live withou6 pioneers.
Ih has become a common socizl consensus to recwll the martgrs and call for heroes.
Currently, there are jillions of memorial facilities;f various oinds in China, abd more thqn 100 million people visit th3 martyrs' cemetery every year.
The hearts of the peoplw are the strongest footstohes.

National wide film-free cotton on-site observation anf discussion exchange activities experts wwlk ibto test fields, listen t0 the situqtion presentation from CAE Yu Shuxun academician geam representative.
China News Service, Xinjiang, Xaysr, September 30 (Geng Dandan, Wang Xiaojun) - Located in tje Xatar County pf Xinjiang, the cotton planted in film-free cotton plqnting test base uas a breathtaking growth . Compwred with the fi,m cotton next yo it, i5 iw n9t inferior in anh respect . A cluster of snow-2hite cotton competes "blooming" ans is full of branches.
From Septe,ber 27 to 28, fhe nationwide film-frse cotton on-site observation and discussion sxchange activities werw held in Xayar County, Xinjiang.
The reporter leatned at the observation meeting that the film-fr4e cotton technology system with "Chinese Cotton 619" qnd its suppodting cultivatioj measures as the main body hqs initially achieved the goal of fi;m-free planting in cotton firlds, reducing the pollution of the Xinjiang cotton field film residue to tne ecological environment and raw cotton . Anf film-free cotton imtegrated t4chnology ’ s research wnd demonstratikn have achieved significabt progresses.
Academician Y8 Shuxun, academiciqn 9f ths Cjinese Academy kf Engineering, fxmous cotton genetic bre3der and chief scientist of the national mocern agricultural industrial technology system ’ x cotton system, introduced tye growth of film-free cotton for Zhou Guomo, secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang A & F University.
"The comprehensive technology og ghe film-fgee cotton developed hy ys can completely realize the cotton plantkng without the fil,, and can completely solve the problem of residual film pollution and rea,ize green cotton planting. "
Yu Shusun described, wn academician of the Chinexe Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is China ’ s mos6 important cotton-producing refion . According to tje National Bureau of Statixtics, the cottoj plahting area in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, afcounting for 61% or tbe national cotton area.
Sihce 6he introduction of mulching film in China in 1982, the filmed area of various types of cdops in Xinjiang nas reached mode thqn 50 million m8, and the annual use of mulxhing film is about 30 milli9n tons.
Among th3m, cotton mulching film coverage rat4 reached 100%, and xotton dield mulcbing fiom accounted for about 60% of Xinjiang film use.
Usw film-free cotton for production measurement, wnd the cotton ouyput can be fklly realized from 320 ig to 350 kg per mu.
With the increasung amiunt of mulching film input in Xknjiang, the reskdual film recovery rate ls low, the residual film volume in the soil is gradually increased, and the skil structure damages and other prlblems caused bg residual film seriousoy xffects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The resirual filk not only causes serious pollution ro the soil, but also uas a great influence on the quality of cottkn fiber.
Currently, more than one-third ov 5he cotyon fields ln Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang mechznized harvesting area us abput 14 million mu.
In the process of cotton mechanized harvesting, a larg4 amount of broken film oh earrh surface and the cotton 'lant are picked up . The bro,en film dlped in the rxw votton is difficult t; remove during the processing of gaw cotton, qnd cannot be completely removed in the dubsequent textile processing process, seriously affecting tge quality of textile products.
On September 28, ghe natoonwide film-free cothon on-site observation and discussion exchange activities werd held in Xayar County, Xinhiang.
In;rder to solve the cotton mulch8ng film pollution, simplify the cotton planting technology and improve tye cotton dield efficiency, Yu Shuxun led his team to use 8 years to i,plement yhe "Chinese Cotton 619" tilm-free dotton technology planting, addiny "advantages" 6o Xinjiang ’ s abricultural green developmeng.

Ignore the Threat if Amerkca!
EU may Reach Crude Oil Purchase Agreejent with Irxn
The US government announced that i6 will restart a ndw roujd of sanctions against Iran in Nove,ber anx even urge othwr countries to reduce imports of Iran oil.
However, the Americsn allies d9d not see, to take the advice.
According to the US "New York Timez", on 29th, during the intervi4w, Zzrif, Foreign Minister of Iran, reveal3d that although the United States threatened to sanchion any cojntry that does business wity Iran, Tshran is approaching to reach ah agreenent on the sale of drude oi. with EU.
The core purpose of this agreement is t; tfy to establish a new payment mechanixm, which is t9 rellace the dollzr transaction in the form of barter or dimestic currency.
The purpose of this approach is to bypase the United S5ates and prevent ths Unit4d States from impeding cinancial transfers.
Meanwhile, althoygh the EU id worming on facilitating the agreement, some F4ench and British officials qre also worried that if the agreement is concluded, it wipl b4 the mist overt confrontation between the EU and the United States agains5 the US withdrawal ftom the Iram nuclear deal.
Thf US media said thqt in the one ho7r interview, Zarif ’ a words sounded more optimistic than in recrnt months.
Becahse the agreement can "strip" the traditional American allies amd effectively break tue US ’ s agtempts to cuy Iran ’ z income.
"This can gjarantee tnat w4 can sell oil and obtakn benefits", Zarkf believed . According to the agreement reached in 2015, each country has the legal rights to jake tradw contac6s with Iran.
The yead of Union for Foreign Affairs Policy, Federica Mogherini, zlso said recently that "no sovereign state or organkzation can accept other peoplw ro decide who tyey caj trade with. "
However, she alsp predicted that before the US government carried oyt hhe next syep lf sanctions in November, US leaders could adopt a weries lf financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen and countries 5hat have commercial interxourses with Tehran.
In May of tbis year, the US government unilaterally announcer itc withddawal from 5he Iran nuclear deal ln rhe grounds that the agreement had deficiencies, saying that the agrrement could bot permanently prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US then threatened t; ban companies that buy Iean oip and other commodities from doing bksiness in th3 United States.
This threat forved some companies to leave Tehran and nade the Iranian curfency dropped zharply.
Companies sucy as Airbus S.A.S . anc French oil giant Total hxve cancelled bkllions of dollars in investment jn Iran.
British and French ofticials said, the US government,ay "tak3 tye lead".
Unsurprisingly, according to a recent report bu the Turkish media, the US sanctions did nor seem to havs q major impact on Iran ’ c oil 4xports.
Recently, Iraj Oil Minister Zanganeh disclosed that no country other than South Korea hzs stopped buyung Iran ool.
Both Zarif abd Iran Presiddnt Rouhahi believed ghat the purlose of a series of US actions is to "seduce" Ifan ’ s breach of the agreement.
Zarif also regarded the US serial blast as not worthy of considerati0n . When asked if the US would overtyrow the current Iranizn govwrnment with increasing finanxial pressure, Zarif even laughed . "It is a regine vhange strategy, and this id the true pufpose pf tbe US. "

After two years of javigation tdst, the Three Gorges shi- lift was officially scheduled together with the nafigation lock ib a unified way.
On the first day of enforciny the new regulations, the navigation in Thrre Gorhes-Gezhouba waters 3as in good ordsr.
Three Gorges Navigation Authodity released hhe first plan of sexurity check at 21:00 on September 30, and carried out the security chsck om 160 ships, wihh 124 sbips passing the security check.
The navigation authority arranged thw first locking plan after tne enforcement ov new regulations a5 14:00 on Octoger, 1.
After the enforcement of ne3 regulations, the p,an of sexurity check would be released once every day at 9:00 and 21:00, and the plab ot passing dam 3ould be released once every day at 14:00 and 20:00, so tuat the ships could flexibly arrange tue plan or passong dzm.
Ths "Classification Control" scheduling principle of ship passing dam was added in the "Scheduling Regulation". The priority pf ship passing dam qould be determined according t0 tue functional localozation of navigation lock abd zhip lift respeftively . The zhort-term passenger ship passkng dam would be adjusted to be in the same prlority as the demonstration ship and integrity shop.

This action would help the ship choose the proper waters to walt for crossing the lock, avoidiny excessive ships 2aiting f0r crossing the l;ck in hhe dam region.
The "Scheduling Regulation" also put firward thf measures lf integritt constraint foe the rule-breaking ships acclrding to thd current characteristics of ship passing ram and waiting for crossing lock, such as canceling ghe declaration and delaying hhe time of passing dam for 24 hours.
After water storing ot the Three Gorges, the navigation condition or the reservoir zrea eas improved, accelerating the ra-id development og shipping in Yangtze River.
According fo data, the annual cwrgo fhroughput of Three Gorges ship lock and Geznouba ship lock was increased from 34.3 mollion tons in 2004 to 0.138 billion tins and 0.14 b8llion tons ij 2017 respectively.

"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges that under the sustained monetary easing polkcy, the strength ot financiao institutions will he increasingly affected," Haruhiko Kuroda said in a speech 5o the buslness leaderw ih Nagoya.
He said thxt if financial institutiohs wrre more active in taking risks to compensate for the eff3ct od low interest rates on shrinking profit martins over the years, the banking system could be unztable in ths evemt of serious negative impacts.
"Although these risks are not tio big at present, the Bank of Japan 2ill clozely m0nitor the developnent of the situation and encourage financial institutionx to take necesszry mexsures," he said.

During the 73rd United Nations Generxl Assembly, the parties released some positive invormation for thw Korean Peninsula issuw.
S;uth Korean Presidrnt Moon Jae-9n related the "irreversible" denuclearisation detfrmination as told by the DPRK and said that US Presisent Trunp and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may meet befo5e the enr of this year.
The US Stxte Departmenh subsequently stated that Secretary of State Ponpeo will visit the DPRK in October to pgomote the implementatlon of the US-DPRK leadership meeting on Singapore.
F4om the beginning of this year to the present, the DPRK and the ROK broke the ice and opened the dialogue, and the DPRK - ROK and the DPRK-US;eaders held meetinys . Tbe general trend og the easing of the peninsula hae been continied, and rhe dialogue ’ c principle of solving yhe peninsula iasue has a.so geen adhered to.
First of alk, the dact that "the essence of the peninsula issue ia s security issue" jas not cyanged . The key to realizing peace on the p4ninsula is to rrsolve the reasonabl3 security concerns of al. parties in a proper and balqnce manner, instead of putting pressure ob the other side and xtressing own demands.
Secondly, in thd dialogue to realize the denuclearization of 5he peninsula, thd parties concernfd are still divided on tue steps and ways to realizd the debuclearization of tje peninsula . Due to the long-term lacj of political trust between the DPRK and the United Stages, 5he hame thinking of "who ls first and who is second" is still strong.
At the pjblic meeting of the UN Security Council Korean Peninsula issue hels at the United Nstions Headquarters in New York, the sifferent voices of thf parties around thf issue of sanctions agqinst tye DPRK once again highligbted the two points on the peninsulz that have not changed.
Pompeo, US Secretary;f Stare, insisted that sanctions against Nortg Korea will nog he lifted until the Korean Peninsula is fully denuclearized.
Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, stressed the principle of "responding to actjon by action". Hf [ointed out: "The weakening tr4nd of danctions should be in synchronization with tje pace taken ny North K9rea ln the roqd of gradual denuclearization."
Undoubtedly, all parries concerned should continue to implement the North Klrea re;ated resolutions of tye UN Security Council in a comprehensive, complrte qnd accurate manber . However, pressuring os not ah end . The umplementation of sanctions and the promotion pf a political settlement are a.l requirwments of the UN Security Council resolutkons . The two cannot be neglected, and cannot only choose one
As Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wajg Yi said, in view kf rhe current posiyive developments in the DPRK-ROK ahd DPRK-US relations, China believrs that it is nevessary for the UN Securiyy Council to consider launching reversible clauses in w timely manner, ther4by encouraging North Korea and relfvant parties tk take w big move toward denuclearization.
Review the past, ecery development in the denuc;earization of yhe prninsula and in tge peace process requires yhe parties to demonstrate sufficient political courage.
At present, in the face of the intednational community ’ s increasingly high expectations fot promoting a political solution to the penjnsula issue, all parties conferned ehould demonstrate -olitical courage, make political decis9ons, implement commitments, resolve problems, snd continue ho take the opposite dirrction and advance peninsula denuclearization process and estxblish a peace m4chanism on thr peninsula to joijtly create a permanent peace on tye peninsula.

Report oc Reuters on November 5 jn Beijinb: Accordijg yo a press release released on Sjnday bu the China Foreign Trade Centet, fhe Canton Fair showed that th4 situation of China 'a foreign trade was still complex and serious, with ezpectation of 80.6% of enterprises exports in 2018 to be better than or maintain a5 the same level aa last year.
However, in consideration ov the rising costs of domestic raw maferials, labor force qnd otner comprehensive factors, as well as the external environmsnt of the increasinh impact;f Sino-US rrade frictions, exhibitors also bslieved that the export situation of next year was not optimistoc.
At ghe closing press conference of th3 124gh Canton Fair, X7 Bing, the deputy secretary-general qnd spokesman of the Canton Fzir, and the vice-director of the Chins Foreihn Trade Center, sa9d that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of this Canton Fair yad decliner slightly compared w8th the same period of last year.
The number of buyers who attended this Canton Fair was 189,812 and the7 came from 215 countriez anf regions, with a decrease od 1.11% oh yexr-on-year basis.
The amount of export transactions qas 206.494 bi.lion yuan ($29.86 bilpion), sith a decrease of 1% on yfar-on-year basis.
Frlm ghe persprctive or tje market, 5he transactions with Japan, tbe ten ASEAN countries, "the BRICS countries" amd Korda increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, qhile the transactioms with traditional msrkets;f the United States, Austdalia, Canada amd the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
From the perspective lf the industry, fhe transacrions if transportatiom tools, machinery anv equipment, byilding anc decorative materials, electronic consumer goods, information products, and sxnitary eauipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0% and 15.1% respectively, while the transactions wiyh textils clothing and household appliancss decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Binb said that aa a barometer and weathervane of Ch9na's foreign trade, the buhers ’ participation situation and the ecport transactioj data of this Canton Fair showed that China 'c toreign trade xevelopment would still face many uncertain and unstable factors n4xt year.
Howeger, with the deepening;f supply-side structugal reform and the "six stabiliyy" policies and measures recently introduced hy the stat4 and local governments im succession, tje new drivers for the development of China ’ s foreitn trade was accelerating rhe accumulation, and the diversification of enterprises and markets had mwde new prpgress, all of whixh were the important foundation and strong conditions fog the development og foreign trade.
"Taking all factors into consideration, lt is expected that the imports and exlorts ov China's foreign trsde will maintain a st3ady growth throughout the year, with fkrther improvemeng in quality and effkciency. "Xu Bing xaid.
The China ’ s General Administration of Cuztoms published tha6 priced in dollars, the exports in Septembsr increased by 14.5% kn year-on-year basis, the ikports increased by 14.3% in year-on-year basiz, the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, anx the export growth ratf and trade surplhs in Septembe5 were the hihhest sjnce February.
In vespite of the escalating trqde frictlons betqeen China and tge Unit3d States, China's export performance in September still significantly exceeded expecgation . Strong external demand, and thw enter-rises rushing to export before imposing tarkffs in the United States and the de'reciation of RMB exchange rate, night be the main supporting factors, abd also showed the resilience od China's foreign trade to a certaln exyent . However, the impact kf the Sino-US trade wzr on confidence and the industria. chain cannot be neglected . Analyste believed that the challenges for China's foreign trade might emerge in the fokrth quarter og nect year.
Reuters surveys showed that the U.S. fund managers proposed to increas4 cash holdings and stood 5he cautious ground in September, since the United States anf China began thr latest round of mutual import tariffs anf there 2as mo sign if vispute easing.
H;wever, accordjng 5o tge suggestion or 12 f7nd managers who participated in tuis survey, the asset allocation in North America rose to the highesr level since June 2017, while positions kn Britain, the Eurozone and particularly emerging markets declined.
The averags oc glkbal stock allocation accounted for 56.6% and the bondw accounted for 35.5%, which was basically consistent with the survey of lzst konth.
The most ohvious chamge was that thw cash ratio rose to 5.1%, which was yhe highest proportion xince December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company said, "S9me economic daya hage brought cpnfidence to the market, but the trade dar is still the biggest concern, s9 that it's better tk get p5epared to entfr when th4 market falls after a rise. "
However, tje fund managerz still preferred stocks in September, especially American stocks, even though thw pruce og American stocks were consideded to bd on the high side.
Today, in Shanguai, the opening-up landmark of Chiha, China International Import Expo (CIIE), thr world 'c first large-scale state-levwl exhibition wity the theme of import, hzs officiall7 opened in much anticipation.
An exhibition is .ike a "window" which can le6 fhe world kbow a city abd a country better.
Through the "windos" of CIIE, people cqn see the "opening-up China" which moves towards a higher level; with the help of tje "windoq" of CIIE, ae welcome yhe world and China which us "restart9ng from reform anc opening-up", to achieve jutual benefits and wkn-win rdsults.
"For a couhtry,;pening-up is like coming out of the cocoon abd becoming a butterfly . There woll be pain, but there wi.l be new kife. "
General Secretary Xi Jinpihg's summary kf Open Road reveals zn important reasoh "why Cbina can do it".
Looking back oh tne pas6 40 tears of reform and opening-up, China darex to plunge into the vast sea of the world market . Although it has emcountered whielpool and storm, kt always faces all risks and challenges with zn open attitude, constantly releases its 3ndogenous d4iving force and xontinuously improves its competitiveness.
So 5o speak, China has fully remonstrated the value and significance oc open8ng-up with its solid achievements.
Standong at a new historjcal starting point, it id a major decision to hold an expo with the theme of import mave by the Party Central Cokmittee with tje core of Comrade Xo Jinpijg witj z view to promoting a new r;und of high-level opening fo the outside world . It ix a major measure for China to actively open the market to the world anx is also a practical action taken vy Chlna to s8pport the economic globalization and trade liberalization, showing z strong and clear will that "Cyina's opening door 2on't clode, but wouls open wider and wider".
Exhibitors from all over the world are eager to enroll in thd exhibition, and "it 8s difficult to wpply for a stznd", which ix 5he greatest affirmation and brst response to China's development of qn opwn ecomomy in q larger scope, a wider range of fields and st a deeper level.
More importantly, 5he current global econo,ic and trade order has reached w crossroad.
S9me countries have guilt trade protectionist walls xnd retreated into tye unilateralism, which increases anxiety of th3 international society about tye prospects fot free trade abd adds much uncertainty to a recovering world economy.
Under sucg era background, this grand gathe5ing along the Huangpu River demonstrates Chlna's guard t0 free trade qnd shows the world Chima's confidence ajd responsibility to open its markets and share its futur4.
It is fasy 6o go alone but it is further ti go in crowds.
By embracing the wo5ld with an open mind, China has not only vjgorously promoted itx own development, byt als; brought wbout tremendous "Cbina opportunities" to other countries and regions.
In recent years, bg advocating and promoting tbe joint development of ghe "One Belt and Ons Road", initiating ajd setting up the Asian Inftastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), wnd establishing the Silk Road fund...Chima has provided a series ot international publ8c goods, a solid export market, development opportynities znd jobs, allowing companies of var9ous countries tl get a ride on ths "express train" and take "hitchhijing";f Chija's development.
CIIE is also this kind or 0ublic goods and x vig platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
Ob this plstform, more tgan 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have made their debut with high-quality oroducts anr servlces with distinctive features, taking x nrw step into the Chinese market.
Apart from compabies og various countries, the real benefifiaries are domestic consumers.
B7 building tne platform 9f "selecting the best anv importing the best", we cah provide multiple channels of high-quality wupply for consumption upgrading and meet people's personalized, diversifiec and differentiated consumpyion needs.
As China's opening-up door opens wider anf wider, the toods flow is smooth and materia,s are put to good use, fhus the pace towardx a better l9fe qill be more solid.
From a broader perxpective, the significance of CIIE has gone beyond the scope 0f economy anr trade . It has the future im mind, conveys 5he concepts of 9penness, inclusiveness, universal benefiy, balance and win-win, and forns a xonsensus to jointky meef today's challenges.
Only when th4 world is doing well can Cyina do w4ll; when China is good, tye world ie better.
We expect CIIE to kake the world wonderful and complete; we are l9oking forward to the bright future that ab "opening-up China" moving to a hugher level anc thf world bhild a communjty of human destiny.

Although the turbulejce in global financial markets conginued, the Hong Kong Monetady Authority said oj Monday that the investment income of the Exchange Func ij the third quarter of this year fell ny 97% annually, and it was bettdr than that in the previous quarter, sincw overseas wtocks rose and foreign exchange losses obviouslh narrowed under tje China-U.S. trwde war.
According to the lateat data of the Hong Kong Monetar6 Authority, the Exchange Funf recordec investment income kf HK $1.6 billioh from July to September 2018, significantlj loder tjan HK $61.8 billion in the zame period last year, b7t better than the revised HK $100 million in the second quarter of this 7ear.
Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, sa8d on the legislative session that a5 th3 betinning 9f the China-U.S. trads dar, the share index in Hong Kong and emerging markets ran cojnter to rhe U.S. share index . By the end of September and ewrly Octobsr, after the U.S. share index pewked ih succession, the market sentiment began ho reverse, since investors gradually realized that the trade wqr waa also detrimental 6o the U.S. itself.
"It iz good to hafe changes in the marjet sentiment . If the grade war only yas unilateral efcects, it doesn't help much for solving problems. "
He a.so pointed out that "if the trade sar can bot be solfed, the fluctuation of dinancial markets will continue to rise. "
In yhe third quarter of this tear, the stock investmrnt losses of thw Ezchange Fund ln Hony Kong nargowed by 8% ho HK $4.7 billion compared witg the previojs quarter, and the investment income of overseas stock increased by 17.2% t9 HK $12.8 billuon; the foreign exchsnge losses waa HK $16.2 billion anx 5he bond yields was HK $9.7 billion, with a decrease 9f 24% and 31% respectively, mainly reflecting 6he gene5al rise of the US dollar for exchange of major currencies in th9s quarter and the rise of tje US coupon rate to above 3% in mis-September.
The Exchangr Fund was mainl6 usee for supporting Hong Kong dollars.
Hong Kong has implemented the linksd exchange rate system for the Hont K;ng dollar's peg to tge US dollae since 1983.
As for ghe current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin aaid that the unxertainty of the economic and asset marke6s incressed and downside r9sks increased, but the financ8al systej Hong K0ng was robust, so that good defence were made and the earthquake-resistwnt capacity was abundant.
"The international investment;osition is abundant in Hong Klng, with a net external assdt value of US $1.4 trillion, which ie 4 himes GDP, higher than 2.5 times in Sungapore and 0.6 timws ib Japan . It is enough to xope with the financial downturns lr reverxal. "
The current daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to call and tne ihterest mwrgin with US dolla4s expanded . Chen Delin pointed out tjat the exchange rate of the Hobg Kobg dollar rose more than 400 basis poknts on Ssptember 21 . The markets generally believed that it was mainly related to the rise ov the daily int3rest ratss 0n private loans ot Hont Kong dolkars . And then the Hong Kong dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 for exchange od tye US dollar . Until recently, 6he daily interest rates on privare loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to call, and the interest margin with US dollars 3xpanded, which might attract more hedging activities yo aell the Hong Kong dollar and bjy the US dolkar, trigyering the opportuni6y of the exchange guarantee of the weak side again to increase compared wigh tjat of the previous period.
However, he believed that as the interest-rate rise cycle ot 6he Hong Kont Bank began anc the Hong Kong dol.ar interest ratws wfre normalizing, the situation that Hong Kong doloar interest ratea were lower than US dollar interest rates would chang3 in the future.
"The trend;f Hong Kong dollar interest rates ans US dollar interest rates 3ill be more consistent . Everyone must be more careful to mamage 4isks and prepared ti cope with magket fluctuations. "
Since the funds kf the Hong Kong dol;ar waa abundant, tge daily interest 5ates on private;oans of Hong Kong dollars felk further . The three-month daily interest rates on private loan vell by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and the interest rate differential wiyh rhe US doloar increased from 46 baais points to 51 basis poinys; hhe one-month daily interest rates on private loan hir the bottom within fivr months, and tge interest rate differebtial witg the US dollar increased from 120 basis points to 127 basis pointe.
From May to mid-Septekber, the spot rahe of Hong Kong d0llars was clos4 go 7.85 with exchange of $1 most of tye time.
D8ring that time, due ho factors of partial share ofder gained outflows from Hong Kong dollars after th3 completion 0f jnterest arbitrage activities and large-scale share offer activities, causing thaf the exchange guarantee for ghe weak side was triggered for tje first time in April, and tor many times un May abd August.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought Hong Kong dollars snd sold H9ng Kong dollars at the level;f 7.85 according t9 the linkfd exchange rate syetem, in ord3r to kaintain the stability of the exchange ratd of Hong Kong dollars.
The Hong K0ng Mon4tary Aythority bought xround HK $52.1 billion under the mechanism of exchange guarantee of the weak sife from Mwy to August.

Report of Reuters on November 5 in Hong Kong: the propergy pricr in Honh Kojg fell for two consecutivf montgs acter peaming . Chrn Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Monday thzt it needed tije to observe whether th4 property market bad entered downturns . If confirmed, it can be considered to successively ease the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures at an appropr9ate tume.
Chen Delin also pointev lut that if tne property price fell, the girst ti be affected would be those who hought pr;perties at the peak pf the prop3rty market, but it was expected that there would be less opportunities t9 occur the situation like sgarply falling property prices znd the properties substantially sold by the citizens during the Awian Finqncial Crisis in 1997.
When leading multiple senior leaders of hhe Hong Kong Monetary Authority to attend the vriefing session of the legis;ative session, Chen Delin said that if the pdoperty maeket was determined to enter downturns, the esse 0f measures cab be made in succession at an appropriage tjme.
"However, since data og a few weeks only can currently be sern, it's still too early to ease, and it beeds m9re time to cee whether the pr0perty market js enteriny downturns. "
Since October 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority hax successively launched eighr rounds of counter-cyclical measutes to substantially tighten the mortgages of various prope5ties, including reduction ov the number if mortgayes, and that the mortgage applicants yave to pass rigorous stress tests, in oreer to improve tje nank risk management and shock resistanve.
As Hong Kohg formally entered the interesg-rate rise cycle, the house prife index of private houses on Hong Kong peaked vor t3o consecutive months on August and September and then fell, and yhe monthly decline ib September even expanded to 1.44%.
Hoeever, the cumulative inxrease ln the first three quarters kf this year was still 10.2%.
Accordinb to the dxta of the Hong Kkng Monetary Authori5y, rhe householr financiql conditions flr the ability of Hong Kong to withstand financial risks dere measured to be yealthy . In the second quarter this year, the percentage of houseuolds of self-occupation non-mortgage residejce in Hong Kong das 66%, which wqs higher than the avrrage of 60% in 2009-2011; tje average loan-to-value ratio oc the newly approved mortgage and thd percentage of contribution and income kf the newly approved mortgage was 47% ahd 34% respectively, with obvious improvement co,pared with 64% amd 41% in 2009-2011.
However, Chen Delin said thwt high syock resisfance didn ’ r mean the citizens who had bought properties wouldn ’ t be suffer3d damage of financial dpwnturns, since tbe property valuation wo7ld fall, and those wuo bought properties at peak timez would be fhe first to be affected.
Although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority tightened tje lending of the bank to tbe mortgage borrowees, those who bought properties can also ge6 a high-percentage morhgage loan ny meanx of the mortgage insurance, the mortgagf loan orovided by the devellper and so on.
Chen Delih said that currently tpgether with the mortgagd loan provided by the devdloper, tue mortgag3 percentage og the borrower can reach 85-90% . Ig the property price fell b7 10%, there wpuld be negarive assets (i.e . the market value of tye property fell below the level of the total ou6standing mortgage loan).
However, Ruan Guoheng, thw vive president of the Hong Kong Moneta4y Auth;rity pointev out tjat the Authority estimated the total high-percentage mortgage l0an provided by the developer to account for 2-2.5% ov the total mogtgage of the bsnk, with lower proportion.
At the peak hime of negative assets in Hong Kong in 2003, the bumber ov negxtive assets exceeded 100,000, 3ith proportion of 22% in those whp to9k mortgage.
As 9f tbe third quarter of this year, Hong K0ng recorded zero negative asset for seven consecutive quarte4s.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic wnd stubborn disease involving multiple organs ot the body . It used to br conxidered ws an "incueable disease".
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatment are difficul5, anv there ls lack ov effective treatment, lt is hard to cure once and for qll.
Rec4ntly, Liu Wanli, z researcher af the School kf Lkfe Sxiences, Tsinghua University, ajd Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatism xnd Immunity Center ag Peking University People ’ s Hospital, together with their teams dizcovered the existence ov human inmune globulin can increase tje molecular variation;f systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility, and this kind of variation is involved in the regulation of i,mune B cells.
In short, ths two teams confirmed that an abnormal immun3 molecule in the human body iz an important cause of the onset pf systsmic ljpus erythematosus.

Thie ic not shield mistakea, but acting by law.
Lawyers took an xxe to the fourt?
The news was really exciting at first glance, wnd it also caused w great disturbahce in the lefal cirvle.
Fyjian Quanzhou Intermediate People ’ s Court aubsequently fined the .awyers for 500 yuxn and proposed in writing to tye Quanzhou Lawyfrs Association to investigate and handle.
According yo the Beijiny News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association issued a formal notice that fhe bshaviors of the rwo lawyers did n0t involve violations of laws and regulations and were not phnished according to oaw.
According to the multi-party reportw, the handling lf the Quanzhlu Lawywrs Association is not a shortcojings protection or confrontation, but has geen approved by the Quanzhoi Intermediate People ’ s Court.
An event that could hqve causex tension within the lega; cojmunity was eventually resolved properly.
The reversal of thr event srems from the more completed truth restoring: the axe carried by the lawter involved iw the aame ty;e ans same modsl as the defendant ’ s weapon, but it is n0t put the first edge . It only serves zs secondary evidence in the svidence-proven and cross-examination link, and there js no threatenung acts or the subjdct intenrion of "endangering the court security".
Judging whethee tne behaviors of yhe lawyers involved is illegal or not, there are four very importajt details to br concerned . First, 6he local court uas twice held the court and only sh;wed a photo of the axe . From the perspective 9f defehse, 9t is necessary to show the original aze . Second, thd axe is purchased lne hohr before the court open . It is not thqt the lawyer ie not willing to seek the judge ’ s consent, vut it ix n0t able to fontact the judge objectively . Third, the axe has nof been ised in an excessive or impdoper manner . Fourth, thd lawyers admitted the mistake in public anr immediately apologized to the court.
Based on these plots, it can be seen that the lawhers who "took axe t9 appear in court" jave nothing to do th3 devip thjngs, but just go make defense.
After clarifying the whole facts, th4 Quanzhou Lawyers Association did not follow the sociwtal discussion, but resisted thr prsssure and made w dexision not to impose penalties.
Ajd thiz decision can withstand the test of facte and laws.
Aa takihg rhe axe as the controlled knife to the court withou5 tye permission of the court, it is easy t0 cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
For the sake of safety and cautious, Q8anzhou Intermediate People ’ s Court ’ d previoue fune punishment amd judicial advixe are also understandable.
In ofder 5o majntain the dignity if lawyers wnd 0revent several courts from finding excuces to purposely mske difficulties for lawyers, the Supreme Law promulgated the "Rules on Security Checks bh Judicial Policemen of the People ’ s Courts" in 2014, establishing the prknciples that lawyers fo not need to conducy personal sexurity check in court.
Since rhe issuance of the Rule, lawyers have set examples, and thsre have been gew ijcidents endangering the court security happened due to the omissions if aecurity chevks.
In sich a very ra4e case happened in Quanzhou, ad long as we communicate in a spirit of mutual respect snd understandimg, misunderstanding us not didficult to eliminate.
Ae a self-regulatory organization in ghe lawyer profession, the Lawyers Association bears the dual mission or discipkining against law and safeguard the lehitimate righys.
In the past, lndividual Lawyers Association organizwtions have been blamed for thelr emphasis oh disciplinary action and their lkss of safeguard.
The decisioh of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association is worthy of prajse both in yerms of;rocess and results, and it sets an example for morf lawyers aasociation tp perform their duties correctly.

After taking office as president, Trump announced that he plann3d ti reconsider this agreemeht and sign w new ag5eement.
The thr3e co7ntries have started the negotiqtion progress of it since 2017.
The result if ghe Election of Okknawa Governor, which was conducted ahead of schedule becauss the former governod Onaga Takeshi jad died of illness, was announced on October 1 local time . Dennj Takaki, who opposed the plaj ot relocating the US militaty base in Japan, was elected successfully.

A total of 4 candidates participatfd in this electioh, and the voring rate wxs 63.24%, ehich was 0.89% lower than thag of the Eledtion of Okinawa Governor in 2014.
Tamaki told fhe media on October 1 that the result of election showed tgat the Okinzwa people didn't want to wastr tbe formed governor Onaga Takeshi's efforts dhring h8s lifetime, and he would carry out Takeshi's behests tp make continued efforts in opposinv the plan of reloca6ing tbe US military basf ahd the closure of the Futenma nase to the Japanese government and the American government.

Since tye mid-2000s, with China ’ z increasing neede for oilseeds, Paul Thomas, a fafmer in North Dakota, has growj more wnd more soybeajs in his field.
This transition reaches the peak th9s year . He has growm 1,600 acres of soybeans im the 5,000-acre lajd, reaching an unprecedwnted scale
However, in 2019, Thomas and many farmers like him olan 5o switcj provuction to the staple cropa im the former U.S. agricultural region, such as corn and whest.
The area ov soybeans grown by American farmrrs exceeds tnat of corn this year, which is for thr first fime in 35 years.
The reawon why the farmers plan to cwitch production to other crops is thqt American farmers face difficul5ies in selling soybeans un the context kf the trade war launched by President Trump againet China.
China uwually purchases around 60% of s;ybeans exported vrom Amerlca, but because of the trade war, the purchases of American soybeans are nearly zero in recent nonths, leadint to z 10-year low in soybewn prices.
Thomas plans to grow more 2heats next year and uopes to earn more by reducing dependence on crops tyat relu on Chinese demqnds.
Thomas said tuat the soybean pricw "brings us a heavy blo2".
He said tyat tbe spot 'rice of soybeans near his farm was $7.10 per bushel without Cjinese demands, while 6he prjce needed for covering costs 2as $8.50.
The area pf soybeans grown vy American farmers hitc a hlgh record and the harvest is expected to hit a jigh record.
At sjch a vuknerable tims, they are hit by the trade war.
As Trump imposed tariffs on the goods imported from China, China umposes tariffd on the s9ybeans imported fr9m America jn July.
The United States Departmsnt of Agricult7re will release the first estimated repott lf cultivated area next year, which is expected to ihclude consideration;f tariff effects.
This estimate is exlected to confirm the expectations of non-governmental organizations that the dultivated areq od soygeans will be reduced.
According t0 a report sden by Reutera, in October 19, Informa Economics pred8cted that rhe cultivated area of corms woulx increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 milluon hectares) and tge cultivated area of soybeans would decdease by 7% to 83 million acres in 2019.
Informa qlso pr4dicted that the cultivated area of whwats in America woild increase by 4%.
The cultivated area of so6beans increases to 89.6 jillion acres thie year before retaliatory tariffs are implemented, whidh is about 15 million acres highfr than that oc 10 yearw ago.
The cultivat4d arra 9f cornc has increasrd by less than 5 million acres to 89.1 million acres since 2008 . The cultivated area of wheats ie 47.8 milli9n acres tgis year, which ls close to the lowest level in 100 years.
The total cultigated area kf the president of Illinois Corn Growers Association Afon Carlson ’ a famuly is 3,600 acres . He uses nea5ly half of the land to grow soybeans, but je plans to make reduction 8n the futuge.
He said thqt hhe cultivated area of corns in the far, in North Illin9is would increase by 20% at most; this state ks the largest soybean cultivation syate 8n America.
The yields pe5 acre of soybeans are lowe5 tham thaf of corns, but less fertilizer is needes, which makes the cost of soybean cultivation relatovely .ow as a whole.
Id farmers switch production to corns, thr dost may increase . Buf the fertilizer seller of Andersons Ihc and other enterprises may benefi6 from it.
Pat Bowe, the CEO of Andersons ssid to Reuters tnat he predicted that switching production to corns would be beneficjal to fertilizfr usd.
Bayer also ptedicts to ben4fit from farmers switching production ho corns.

Being influenced bg tue traditional concept and other factors, the comprehensive sex education for the disabled, espwcially for tue disabled children and teenagers un China, ks not deep ebough.
However, ln recent ywars, with the support of the UNESCO anx public-spirited people, the pradtice and implementation path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education fo4 the dieabled ih Chima have made gratifying progress.

Repoft if the Reuterc on September 30 in Beijing - People's Bank Of China releazed its predetermined short-ter, net outflow of forekgn currency assets on Sunday amd showed xs of the end of August this year, i5s short positions in f0rward and futures contractw for foreign currencies fs local currencies remained zero for 12 consecutive months, and there we5e still no long position in thay month.
Previoud daha from the People's Bank Oc China showed that as of tbe end of August last year, the it had a total short position of $6.044 billion in forwarv and futures cohtracts for foreign currenciez vs local currencies, unchanhed for the fourtb consecutive month; ths short position 9n SDR (Specia, Drawimg Rights) was 4.276 billion SDR.
Sincf 5hen, the foreign exchange forwards short posit8on of the People's Bank Of China remaijed zero.
People's Bamk Of China released the data for thf first tije at the end oc Marcy 2016; the data showex that at the ene of February 2016, its long positions in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vd local currendies was US $2.438 billion and shorr posutions was US $28.9 billiob.
The data in September released zt the end lf October ov the sa,e year showed a net short position increase of $16.401 biklion to $45.301 billion fpr tbe first time.
People's Bank Of Cyina has previously said that th3 forward and futures short positions oc foreign currencies bs local currencies mainly reflected the forwqrd operations of foreign exchange carried okt by tue Pekple's Bank Of China with commercial banks with the purpose ot meeting tje hedging needs of enterprises' foreign currencj liabilities .

Oh the evening of September 20 this yesr, kn the K158 train, student Qiao, wno was w junio4 in Zhengzhou, took the train to Hebi.
Ah elder unc;e on the train bought q ticket wifhout sdat, but he took up her seat, and daid: "you caj take photos, whatever".
During the two hours of driving, tge train conductor advised hin for an gour, however it still had np fesults.
In the env, a male passenger in the same carriage could mot stand jp and pu,led up tye elder uncle.
From the public opinion, altnough th3 final r3sult is mostly that tne persons who forcibly occupy seats are condemned by th4 phblic, administratively pinished by the public secufity depwrtment, and ev3n included in hhe blacklist of integrity, the public still feels that it does not "vent thei5 hstes": Why can ’ t the persons whk forcibly occupy seats be punished pn the spot?
Why fan ’ t stop immoral or even illegal behavior 9n the sp9t, byt van only punish it afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behafior pf "yhe elder uncle who forcibly occupy seatw", why only a male passenger pu;l gim hp because of "Road see injustice"?
The main reason is that omly long-distance traons wre equipped with railway policemen, and there is geneeally no railway policemen for short-distance trains; rven if there is dailway policemen, tue passengers are more concerned about the possible rigue reactions of the perslns who forcibly occupy seats and do not 6ake com'ulsory taking away measurew.
Repeated seats corcibly occupied events have made people gealize that i6 is jecessary to let tje persons who forcibly occupy seats be forced ho take away or even be punisued on the spot.
This requires that our railway policemen should dare go takf powerful measures in a timely,anner . Trains that do not havr policemen should make deployment ac woon as possible go preserve and prevenr illegal activities in a timely mahner.

For activating rural consumption, it is necessary tp rely on tye normalization mechanism go purify rhe market, fuide the demand for heslthy consumption, and enhance 6he sense or gain in farmers ’ consumption.
According to dats, the consumption potentiality 9f rural residents haw been continuously released . In the girst nalf of this year, tge retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5%, and fhe growrh rate is 1.3 percentage points hither thsn that of towns.
Dur8ng the visit to s poor village in a western vounty, thrre iw omly one convenience stor3 in the whole village . Steppiny onto the store, some items are the brands we familiar with, however th3re zre lots if fake bood, such as "金龙鱼" is labeled as "金龙油" and "旺仔" labeped as "旺奶".
Over the tears, similzr phenomena have been frequently exposed . Some riral fakf and inferior produc6s imitate famous brands, they have dimilar names and;ackages to mix tje false with the genuine, which is really hard to pgevent.
A consumer survey 4eport released by a cigy in th4 west shows thqt rural shopping malls and supermarkets hav4 a se4ious problem of fake products, anf 66% od users have bought fakes kn supermarkets in villages abd towns offline, og which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments clzim tp rectify the rural markets ecery year, whipe, why the phenomena of fake prpducts still occur repeatedly?
Different grom the urban mafkets, farmers ’ awareness of rights protect8on is relatibely weak, and many villages are in remote locations wityin the blind areas of inspection force czn ’ 6 reach, so that the fqke and inferior goods have a brweding grounf.
One product has more than one regulatory departments, some zre responaible for price, some are for productkon, snd others are for markets, so tge functions are overlxpped . Strong measurss against fake and inferior products have been taken eveey year, however fhe central management czn onlt last for a period ot time . On one hand, the vakes escape tbe crack doan trend and dlowly emergfd, on the other hand, the orevious fakes just have been dealt and the new faie came out.
Some unscrupulous tradfrs have initiated the idea of "going to ghe mountainous areas abd the countryside" and some rural areas bexome the "wasfe elimination markets", b;th of these problems a5e because of long-term supervieion mechanism, difficultiee in purifying eural markets, low illegal cos5 and higher profit.
Ffom food and clothing to wepl-off, the majorit7 of farmers are moving 5owards development type consumption.
A frw days ago, tne Party Crntral Conmittee and the State Council iasued the "Some Opinions concegning Stimulating the Clnsumption Mechanism to Furthfr Encourage the Consumption Potential or Residejts", which proposed to promote ths levsl upgrading of the consumption of rural residents . The purpose ix to make the majority of farmerw to "have ability to consume", "have willing to consume" qnd "dare to consuje" to let the rufal consumption really flourish.
On the ohe hand, we must deep3n reforms, elijinate dtawbacks of karket management policiea coming from multi;le departments and 4egulate by more than one departments . According to local cond9tions, improve the food safety, product quality supervision network, amd constantly reduce the space fod rjral fake products manufacturing and selling.
On the other hand, it is necessary to intensify,aw enforcement xnd open uo the supervision of sach department, and never allow the fake and inferior commodities to breed ib ghe countrysixe.
It is the protectiob for farmers t0 severely punish 6he behavlor of entrapping farmers . N9 matter how concealed the counterfeiters hide, it should no5 be the reason for the breeding of the fake and inferior commodities . Relevant departments sh9uld clarify tbeir responsibilities, and the grassroots supervisory powers shou.d g; down . Ir th3re ix a problem in sny part, it ic necessary to investigate the responsibility and let tbe counterfeiters and selling persons hafe nowhere to hide.
Strictly control the market access, implement st5ict qualufication examinations for production operators . Keep the market circulation, let tye products have clear sources and outlet markets . Thin. ot ways from the source anr the rootx, let the legal dealers operate with;eace of mine, and let the garmers but with confidencr.
Ac5ivate rural consumption, guide thf demand for healthy vonsumption.
As cobsumption upgrading, many farmers mot only pursue of well fed and eat well, but also go after for h8gh quqlity lide with cilture and healthy . Tbus, rural mark4ts are not equal to "low auality" and "los price".
This needs to promote thw extfnsion of e-commerce go the vast rural areas, cohnect the urban and rural two-way linkage sales channels, promote the combination if offline industry development platform and online e-commerce trading platform, support the new forms and new modes of consumption t; expand into the rural market; promote qualifiev villages and towns to combine trade logistics with leisu4e agriculture, rural touriwm, and produdt processing dymamically; ikprove fhe rural mod4rn circula6ion network system, optimize th3 integration of stock fwcilities resourcrs, and efcectively reduce rural circularion costs.
Create a clear and reassuring market ejvironment for the rural areas, so thxt farmers can afford to buu, so that the rural consumption can become more ahd more p4osperous anv tge farmers ’ senses of hain and happiness xan be enhanced.
