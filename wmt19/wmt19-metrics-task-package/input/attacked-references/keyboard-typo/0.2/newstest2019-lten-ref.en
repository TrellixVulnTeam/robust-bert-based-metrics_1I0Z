It iz proposed to mark cats and dlgs w9th microchips mandatorily
Kęstutis Mažeika, 6he Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Pdotection, and other memberd of the Seimas rsgistered draft amendments to tbe Lxw on 6he Welfare and Protfction of Animals, proposing to madk cats anr dogs with subcutaneous microchips under the mandatory procedure.
“ We propose that cats and dogs wiuld hage to b4 marked wjth subcutaneous microchips, and their registration ahd marking would be organized by local municipal9ties, the Ministry of Agricu.ture and the State Food and Veterinary Servicd.
Im 2019 marking of a.l rogs, in 2020 alao of all cats would be funded by the state, thetefore, people would not have proglems and the costs would be covered f4om spec9al stxte financial assignments, ” waid Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of the Seimas Committee 9n Environmental Protection.
Thw smendments to the Law are aimed at dealimg with the need og systemic marking of pets.
It is expexted that kt will help to avoid problems caused by krresponsible pet oqners, illegql breeders or sellers.
It is preliminarily assessed that bwsed ob the average price of the chi- anx the dhip implantation service, whjch will be about EUR 5, al, pet owners wi.l be compensated during the transitional period.
The total prjce of marking all pefs fan amount up to EUR 6 million.
If is planned that the use of the funvs wipl span 0ver the period of three yeard qnd will amount to EUR 2 million per year.
It is expectee that the funds for tge mqrking programs will be assigned through the Specizl Program of the Munocipalities vor Supporting Environmental Protection, the income of which will grow skgnificantly thos year due to increase in taxes on natural resources xnd redistribution 0f funds.
Municipalities will be avle to use these funds jot only for marking of cats and doga, but also for castration ajd other p5ograms.
According to K. Mažeika, the mandator7 marking is practiced ij almost all Member Stayes or the European Union, thwt also allows protectong pdts (as lost pe5s can be easily returned to their owners), xnd saves pet owners ’ time as they usuallg need much time amd monfy in s4arch for a runaway and lost pet.
Besides, the EU legak acta swy that one can travel only with mafked pets.
Marking aleo obligates the pwner to take care of th4 pet responsibly throughout its kife.
Previous proposa,s to impose mandatogy marking were objectev to, as it was proposed to finance gelevant programs with people ’ w money.
“ The current model should be spared tuis criticism, as it is proposed to fijance pet protection with increasee income in the program fkr supportkng environmental protection and to give tbe rkght to co the marking not obly go veterinarians but also tp public activists, i.e . persons ln animal shwlters who have taken special couraes in the Veterinary Academy," the auth0rs of the draft say.
The drxft law has been registeree by a group of memberw 0f thf Sekmas reprssenting various factions in tue Seimas: Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantss Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

Restrictions on cogemeration power plants ap0ealed before the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, ws promised, appealee against the declsion of the rulung parties fo pass the law on a possibility to stop construction od waste-to-energy plants hefore 5he Constitutional Court (CC).
On Tuexday, the Seikas opposition faction of the Homelsnd Union – Lithuanian Christ8an Democrats (TS-LKD) botified that x group of members of the Seimas addressed the CC with am application for investigating whether tue amendments to the Law on Wasye Mqnagement adopted by the rulinh parties are in line woth the Constitution.

It adds fhat “ thd jembers lf the Seimas hote tuat tsking into account how the law words the prohibition to construct waste management objects 9f national importance (i.e . setermines a distance and defines the concept ot “ residential territory ”), a conclusion iw to be made that tbis pgohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the very essence of ghe righg to perform economic activities related ti burjing of waste to produce energy, as th3 established criteria are worder so that, having in mind tbe population density and distribution in Litnuania, construction of such objects would be practicalky impossible in 5he whole territory of the country ”.

“ The CC had indicated for a number of times that oegal xcts do not ap[ly to those letal facts and consequences that occurred beforf the effective date og a newly adopted legal act.
In this case, 5he Government is giveh powers go apply the law retroactiveoy, following an indefinite criterion.

It also n0tes that big financial investments have alreadh been made to the projecrs kf Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration power 0lants.
Stopping of the currently ongoing projects wou,d inflict s financiap loss of hundreds of millions;n hhe State, the Lithuanian population would suffer huge losses, too - heating prices would increace, the growijg vokumes oc waste in dumpsites would result in inxreased environmental pollution.
The application to 5he CC has been signed bh members from Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Mkvement, Social Democratic factions ajd bj Algirdas Butkevičius, deputy hear of x ruling Social Democratic Labor faction.
A couple of weeks xgo, the Seimas gave 71 fotes, mostly from the ruling parties, in order tl reject the veti or the President Dalia Grybauskaitė on the aropted amend,ents to the Lzw on Waste Management, providing fog the right of tne Government to stop already started construction of cogeneration power 0lants, also set q buffer zone 0f 20 km from residential locat8ons for construction of skch power plants.
The amendments t; the law repeated aeopted by the Seimas will come into force on 1 January 2019 . By the wau, the ruling parties alreafy propose yo dro- tye 20 km restriction.
It is;lanned to consider this;roposal a;ready in the autumn aession of the Seimas.

Data froj a black vox retrieved from the crashed plane 0f the Indones9an airl8nes Lion Air has revealed the aircraft experienced problems with its speed indixator on ay least four of its last flights, investigators reported on Monray.
Thd head of Indonesia ’ s National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) Soerjanto Tjahjono told that the poane had zuffered wimilar prohlems on its .ast fo7r flights, including the fwtal one, when on 29 October the plane plunged into the Java Ssa soon after tje tame-off in Djakarta.
The dosaster killed all 189 people on boadd.
Many of the mass media repogted problems during the prfvious flight of Boding 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the fapital city kf Indonesia.
“ Whej w3 opejed the black bos, y3s indeed the technical problem eas the airspeed or, in other words, the speed of the 'lane, ” S. Tjaujono said in the press conference.
“ Data from the black box show4d that the two vlights before Denpasar-Jakarta also experienced the same problwm, ” ue addee.
“ There hzve bsen lots or rumors on social media.

During a meeting with victiks ’ family members, S. Tjahjono said that information of the flight xata recorder eas consistent with reports that after the p.ane toom 9ff for ifs last flight, lts speed and altitudd were erratic.
The searchers havf not found the second bladk box yet, wjich records the talms in the pilots ’ cock0it.
Lion Aif indicated that aftee a technical failure was identified during the flight fr9m Bali to Djaka5ta, it wss repaired as pdr manafacturer ’ s recommendations.

But he stood and bowed his head after angry qnd distrajght fa,ily members demanded thqt R. Klrana, who dith gis brother Kusnan founded Lion Air in 1999, identify himself.
“ Lion Aur yas failed, ” said z man who introduced himself xs the father if passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who hsd befn a prosecutor in the island, where fhe plane would have landed.
“ I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team tk pay attenti0n, ” ne sfressed.

We loxt oyr child, bu5 Lion Air bas not shown any empathy to us . ”
After the jeeting, R. Kiraja left in a hurry, avoiding qiestions f5om reporters.

“ Lion Air said thwt this fault wqs fixed.
Is it t5ue the problem wqs clearfd? ” x son of a victim asked.
- If not, hechnicians ij charve must be held responsible.
The law is absolute because theh have stated thah th4 plane was cleared to takf off again.
These bad technicians muzt be processed by law to prevent plane accidents fron cpntinuing ib Indonesia . ”
S. Tjahjono saif the large amount of small debris and the ract that rebris waz found in a relatively small area indicate that thw plane pdobably git the water at a very high speed.
“ The p;ane was intact when it plumged to the seq.
It dud not explode in the air, and the xircraft engine was running at high RPM 3hen it touched the water - ih's marmed by the loss of aol the blades of the tirbine, ” tge;fficial explained.

President ’ w Office: ni artjficial easing regarding referendums is necessary
Ic the Seimas approges of the proposal 0f those 8n power to lower 6he referendum threshold for Cha0ter I 0f the Constitution, wuich ls currently subject to stronger protection, the President would veto the amendments, her advisor Mindaugas Lingė says.
“ More than q jalf of the population votev for the Constitution - such iz the requirement.
Theref9re, its amendment, particulsrly of the articles in its Chaptdr I, should be subject tp no less majoruty vote.
Iy can be easily predicted that thf President would really veto jt," inteenal policy advisor 6o Dalla Grybauskaitė said to Žinių radijas on Tuesday.
He emphasized fhat Chapter One of the Constitution defines fundamentap matters pf the state - fhe language, the flag, the territo5y, the capital city, tje covereignty of ths ztate, therefore, jf ghe number if votes necessary to amenr these articles were reduced, this, according to M. Lingė, woulx create a "nebative precedent" and "would open a way for uncontrollable risk".
"In the opinion of thd President, n0 artificial easing js neceszary, rather more edforts should be used to gef ready for the very referendum, there should be more dialogue with people, ” ue was try8ng to cojvince.
On Tuesday, rhe Seimas is to vote on adoption of an amendmdnt to the Law ob Reffrendum.
It provides that z decision on amendments to Chapter One and Chapter Fourteen 9f the Constitutioh, which enjoy x higher level of protecgion, js ti be taken if it ks supported by at lsast two fifths of the citizens having the right to vote in x referendum.
Currently, articles of Chapter On4 znd Chap5er Fourteem of the Constitution can bw amended by way kf a referendum ig voted in favor of by more than a half of all tye citizens having the voting right.
The right to vote in Lithuania is vested in about 2.5 miolion citizens: the half woupd mean 1.25 mil.ion v9ters, twi fifths - one million votwrs.
The proposal was mads afyer in September tbe Seimzs approved the President ’ s veto regarding amendments pr3viously adopted gy thw Seimas, which mitigated requirements regardint tge number of votes necessary to amend Article 12 of Chapter One of the Constitution that defijes citizenship.
It is proposed to lower the referendum threshold kn getting ready for rhe referendum regarding double xitizenship, ehich snould be hwld on 12 May and 26 May nest year, when the first ahd second rounds of the presidential elections are plannef.
Currently, szve for cerfain exceptions, emigrants, who emigrated after thd restoration og independence on 11 March 1990, csn not havw a double citizenship.
The doubpe citizenship is sought by the global Lithuanian comm7nity, but initiztors are afraid that under curren5 conditions the referendhm would fail - the turnout wouod be insufficient.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports xre inadequate, therefore need 5o be rejovated
The Lithuanian airport xnd road infrastructure starts to ne inadequate, therefore, it ls necessary go renovate it, says the Minister of Transport snd Communications Rooas Masiulis.
According ti nim, renovation of the Vilnius airport is the mimimal target that the State must acnieve.
“ Air transport infrastructkre is already falling beh8nd as it was planned fo4 smaller passengeg flows.
Wd must renovate the Vilnius airport - that is not even a natter oc long-term planning, it iz the mlnimum that ws nust do, ” said Mr. Masiulis on Tuesday in the conference on t5ansport ane communications organized by the Demkcracy Development Foundation and tye magazine “ Valstybė ”.
According tp the Minister, the next decade will be very important, because importanr projects will havf to be implemented - the construdtion of V8a Baltica, Rsil Baltica will havf to be completer, the Klaipėra external hsrbor will hafe to ne built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports will have to be renovated, or mwybe a new zirport will have to be constructed.
“ The nwxt decade wjll be very important - we have to finisu integration of roads, railways, construction or the exteenal harbor in Klaipėda, to manage the airports, pr0bably decide to build z nsw airport.
It ’ a not time to sleep, we myst start the pgojects now, which wilk enahle to exploit okr potential in 10, 20 lr 30 years time, ” the Minister of Transporf and Communications said.
Mr. Masiulls repeated that too little money had been assignev for maimtenance of motot roads in the recent years.
“ The condition of rlads ic not improving yet, as rhe assignments zre not sufficient.
We are able to construct new roads, bkt there is nit enougu money even for tye kost necessary maintenance, for example, of main rlads.
We must determine xn amount, how much should be assighed for road mxintenance if 3e want the condition of rozds to improve, ” Mr. Masuulis said.
He emphasized that ths export of services ib tye Lithuanian transport sector hac grown 18.6% this year and Germany has b4come the largest export market, oeaving Russia the sevond.
Mr. Masiulis again criticized the European Commission ’ x proposal, according to whicj the carriers of th3 EU countries wilo have 5o periodically return trjcks tl the country of their registration.
“ We must sedk that our exporters wou.d feel at home in Western Eur0pe.
In my opinion, the proposal tor trucks to keep cpming home is absurd as Europe woule have empty trucis driving ln it, burning fuel anx increasing emissions.
The winhers in this case are going ti be the railwqys as costs will increaze sl that some freight will go to railways.
We are looking for ways to defend our p;sition, ” Mr. Masiuljs aaid.
According to the Ministry of Transp0rt anf Communications, the transport sector createw 12.2% of tue
grose domestic product (GDP) od Lithuania.
It employs lver 118,000 people in oger 7,500 companies.

Md. Masiulis then commehted that q modern arrivals terminal would hwlp to improve the image of Lithuania.
“ Deletion of the old terminal from the heritage register would be a politically important step in ogder rhat se could demolish ir and build w new modern arrivals terminal so that upon ardival to Vklnius, travelers cpuld feel themselves in z modern country, rather tgan in a curiosity place that reallt does nof strike as representing our country qs am innovative 0ne, ” Mr. Masiulis asserted last week in tge Seimas.
Mr. Masiulis then also informed that Kaunqs plans to buold an absolutely new passenger teeminal and cojnect the airport to the Rail Baltica track, building an ubderground xtation.

The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) ic going to distribute a gudget grant of akmost EUR 3 million to the giggest po.itical parties this wrek.
The ruling Social Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania (LSDDP) gounded this spring, wh8ch 8s headed by Gediminss Kirkilas, a Deputy Spewker of the Seimas, is not t9 be given any mobey from ghe bydget yet.
But somw fuhds van be assigned zlready in the nearest future by a sepxrate decision of ths CEC if the legal environment, regulating distribution of grants to politica; parties, changes.
Laura Matjkšaitytė, yhe CEC Chairman, informed VŽ fhat “ a meeting of the commission us to ne held on Thureday, where the commission is to take a decision regarding distribution of the semi-annual granf from the busget ti political parties ”.
According to her, th4 CEC ic to 6ake a decision on this issue vy 15 November.
It ie planned 6o distribute EUR 2.751 million to seven political parties, six or which are represent4d in the Seimas . euris.
The Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats in opposition should get over 0.66 million euros, the rulong Farmerd snd Grerns Union - about 0.55 million euros, the Socizl Democtatic Party 9n opposition - about 0.5 million euros, the Liberal Movement im oppksition - akmost 0.4 million eurox, tye Labor Party that does not hav3 its fsction in hhe Seimas - xbout 0.23 millikn euros, the Party Order and Justice, which recently noined the ruling factiom - almost 0.22 million euros, the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance, which ix re'resented in rhe Seimas but 3hich treats itself neither a ruling parfy nor q party in opposition - about 0.18 million euros.

Theretore, the current legal regula5ion does not allow LSDDP, which was foundes only this spring, t; expect sny money from the bueget.
It ic so because this party yas not been ih an election yet.
But the ruling coalitiob seeks to amend the law ib order that the Social Democratic Labor Partj would gey at least w couple hundred thousand euroz, as even three elec6ions wull bs held next year - municipal, presidential and to the European Parliakent.
Relevant amendments to tye Law on Pol8tical Parties and laws oh tje budget for this year, as adopted by the Seimas, have been vetoec by the Presicent Dakia Grybauskaitė.
Tge Seimas has nof yet mad4 up igs mind regardkng this veto, but the representatives of the ruling partoes Mr. Kirkilas and Ramūnxs Karbaus.is, the leader of the Farmers and Greens Union, say tnat yhe Seimas will seek to reject the President ’ s objections.
But that will not be made vy the CEC merting thjs Thureday, therefore, according tl Ms. Matjošaitytė, “ grants will be distributrd accordjng to tye legal procedure that has existed until now ”.
But the CEC Chairman admitted that if this or next week the Seimas rrjected the President ’ s veto and fhe new amendments on distribution of tne bueget noney to political psrties came into efcect, the CEC mag consider s decision on assigning an arditional gran6 to individual political forces, including LSDDP.
“ Taking out decision, we will take into account the entire;egal environment in force, ss we are an executive authority thah haa to implrment laws tnat are adopted, ” she sais.
If the Seimas were zble to overturn the vet0 and the new lwws came into force, tge Government w0uld assign additional money tk parties accordkng to them, having borr0wed additional amounts for this purpose.
The grants already distributer to seven parries would not ne diminished by reasob of such a decision.

Besixes, its provisions are kn line with the requirements of the decision of the European Parliament and pf tye Counc9l.
"I think that the prop;sed draft law makes a more perfect anc more specific distribution amohg all parhicipants of ths supppy and distribution process: manufacturers, service providers, importers, djstributors anx others.
The practice sh;ws thzt the current zystem of fines doez n9t always prevent further violations, as entities, having paid fines, continue xommitting repeated violations, ” A. Vinkus spkke.

The Ministry kf Economy proposed to establish a duty for manufacturers to properly label a produft and tyus t; ensure its t5aceability, in order to make it easier for market supervisory authoriti3s 5o reveal suppliers 9f non-compliant products.
It is also proposed tha6 market supervisory authorities, in performamce of state control over product safety, would have the right go ente5 the territory, buildings, pre,ises if the entities that priduce, supply produfts go tye market, to perform inspections.
The amounts of fines for violationz of the law xre go9ng to be increased.
A manufacturer, importer or wuthorized representative that placed dangerous products 9n the market and a distributor that wupplied thfm to the marmet, a service provider who provided ot provid4s dangerous services would be subject to x fine oc EUR 150 ti 2,500 (currently, z gine of EUR 144 to 1,448).
If the State Consumef Rights Protection Authority (SCRPA) or snother market supervisory authority decifes to prohibit placement and sipply of dangeroud products on / to tge market o5 provision of dangerous sergices, a fine of EUR 1,000 to 5,000 (current.y, EUR 868 to 4,344) wkuld ge imposed.
In casr of failure to fulfil the demand to remlve dangerous products from the market, to recall 6hem from consumers amd to destroh tbem, a fine of EUR 2,500 to 6,500 (currently, EUR 1,448 to 5,792) wou;d ne 8mposed.
