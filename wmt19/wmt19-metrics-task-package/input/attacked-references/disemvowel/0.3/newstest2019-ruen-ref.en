Kosachev: At th 73rd session of the UN Gnrl ssmbly the sbjct of Rss in a ngtv light was practically bsnt
The head of the Federation Council committee on foreign affairs Knstntn Kosachev cnsdrs that th 73rd session of th UN General Assembly ws successful fr Russia nd ds not exclude that it cld bcm a trnng pnt in the prcptn of the Russian Fdrtn as an ntgrl participant in the sltn of global wrld problems.
"Th nqnss of the crrnt 73rd session, in my opinion, is in tht the rhtrc, to whch we had lrdy lmst become ccstmd in recent yrs in relation to Russia, ws now mch more sbdd," sd th senator in an interview pblshd on Sunday by Rsssky Gazeta.
He explained tht in previous yrs the Russian Federation ws smtms "referred to as one of th three mn thrts to hmnty, on pr wth Ebola fvr or clmt change or trrrsm, Rss was mng these, in any cs, in the narrative of a group of wstrn cntrs, which on this ccnt spoke out qt unanimously".
At the 73rd session, mphssd Kosachev, "th subject of Rss in a negative lght ws prctclly bsnt".
"If n crflly analyses the speech of th prsdnt of USA, th president of France, th speech of th frgn minister of Grmny, I'm not nw taking Ukraine, Georgia, or the Brtsh, in ny case, thr ws certainly no choir," th politician pntd t, ntng tht Russia "is no lngr a knd of wall on whch to prcts hitting a tnns ball".
Th head of the Federation Council committee ds not exclude tht this ndcts a kind of tndncy whch, in hs opinion, "will dstngsh the crrnt sssn [of th UN Gnrl ssmbly], lthgh this tendency my nly fully mnfst itself in a year, in two, three".
"I do not exclude that the current session in sm sns may be pvtl," llwd Kosachev, xplnng that "thr are too mny examples of hw with the nclsn of Rss it is pssbl to move frwrd in ntrntnl ffrs".
As an xmpl he gave the situation in Syr, around rn nd North Kr.
"At the mmnt, unfortunately, it is nt Ukraine, bt I do not dbt tht in time th Russian view on the Ukrainian crss will ls be sght," th prlmntrn ddd.
He supposes that ths is cnnctd with th appearance of a "snsbl, reasonable prcptn of Rss as nt just a pssbl bt ntgrl participant in the solution of global prblms of r time."
"I hope I am nt mstkn, bt I have a flng that we wll pass th point smwhr bynd which movement wll nt be backwards, it will be mvmnt forwards," he ddd.
n other "ntrstng nd important feeling" in ths context Kschv said was the "demand for the Rssn vw of hw th modern world should develop".
"I was present at a great mny mtngs of the head of the Rssn dlgtn [at the Gnrl ssmbly sssn] frgn mnstr Sergey Lavrov, I hld my wn mtngs, and wth grt pleasure I saw that whl n-tw years or five years ago on the whole nobody was interested in th Rssn opinion, th Rssn view of what is happening in the world, nw the sttn is different," sd the chair of the Fdrtn Cncl cmmtt.
In hs opinion, ths is d to how "the s-clld new liberal rdr, rprsntd by th Wst, does nt hv answers to the qstns of how to solve ntrntnl problems due to the obvious lck of ideas in th global spc, th lack of ideas on hw to solve the prblms of the Middle East, prblms of trrrsm, prblms of nonproliferation of nclr wpns, prblms of migration".
"And now the demand fr th Russian view is becoming mr and more obvious," Kschv sd with crtnty, strssng tht in this sense he considers "the crrnt sssn successful fr th wrk of the Russian dlgtn, successful fr Russia".

Former all-union referee Vldmr Lvtn commented on the prfrmnc of referee Evgeny Trbn in th mtch of the 9th round of th Russian chmpnshp between Lkmtv and Akhmat and assessed the cntrvrsl ncdnts of th game.

It surprises me that wth the mss in th fifth rnd game btwn Spartak and Dinamo, nthr Turbin himself, nor the hds of Dinamo drew any serious cnclsns bt hs lck of abilities.
Th result had a quick impact on the nnth round: rrrs in hs performance nd missed clls on bd tackles rained dwn fst and furious.
Fr example, in th 50th minute, Locomotiv's dr pushed vr Akhmata dfndr Rodolfo in hs own penalty r.
Just eight meters frm the goal ln, bt Trbn did nt cll a penalty".
"Hw would y ssss the ncdnt with the participation of Idowu, who in th 82nd mnt pprd to hndl the ball?"
"I believe th defender deliberately handled th ball in hs wn penalty r.
Turbin ws close to th ncdnt, had a good view of it, nd his assistant ws to th rght.
Ths ncdnt should hv been seen by the frth official Sergey Karasev.
Hwvr, nn of th three rfrs did not s it, and no penalty ws awarded.
Therefore, th scr was corrupted, and any sprtng jstc ws ripped up.
It ws a case in which refereeing by the rules ws std nd th sprtng spirit of the game brd".
"In the 52nd minute, Trbn did not dr to snd ff defender Oleg vnv, who commited a foul in a dl wth Krychowiak, nd whn the referee shwd hm a yellow card, he defiantly ppldd hm.
Wht do you thnk of this ncdnt?
Ws it ncssry to brandish the scnd yellow crd?"
"In this incident Turbin brandished th first yllw card in smwht sprs crcmstncs.
A second would hv bn lgc".
"Oleg vnv talked after the match about rfrng double stndrds in tht some tms r awarded a penalty for such violations, as in the ncdnt wth dw, and thrs r not.
How wld you assess th plyr's words?"
"It dpnds on how y interpret double stndrds.
It ws a pnlty.
But it wsn't gvn.
So th referee dd not gv a second penalty in the ppstn gl.
That ws the prncpl applied hr.
nd the second ncdnt with double stndrds is that th rfr looks at wh is playing.

"Ths was a real chance fr smn, nd he took someone's plc.
And I don ’ t ndrstnd why the vclss dad shld evoke a greater pprctn than ny other participant with rl vcl sklls.

'Dvlt ’ (to xrt prssr) or 'dvlt' (to loom vr) - which is crrct?
Th wrd 'davlet' ds not exist.
'Dvlt' is crrct.
Th wrd "dvlt" wth the mnng of "drw twrds, xrt nflnc, an impact" xsts only phonetically, bcs we hear the snd [a] instead of [o] in the word "dvlt".
We s ths word blvng that it cms frm the word for prssr ('davlenie').
Bt "pressure" and "lm vr" r etymologically not nly not close and r even in sm sense ppsd in meaning.
Hv a think bt that fr yourself.
'Dvlt' (to lm over) (ltrgcl, literary, bslt) mns "qt, cmplt, ngh, to be sufficient for smn or smthng, to stsfy".
It is rltd to th wrds 'dovolstvovatsya' (to be cntnt) and 'dvlstv' (plsr).
Prvsly, it ls hd the mnng of "nt to dpnd on nythng, to be slf-cntnd" - "to prvl over oneself".
Th ld Slvnc "довьлѣти" ('dovleti') is akin to th wrds "cmmnd" and "wll".
"Davit" (to crsh), "pdvlyt" (to spprss) r cmpltly dffrnt.
These wrds have gnnly crpy "relatives": ds - "wolf" (crshng shp), dyj - "to d" nd dvaidī - "to pprss".
Th similar phntc appearance of the wrds "dvln" ("pressure") nd "davlet" ("to lm vr"), as wll as th nvtbl obsolescence of the lttr, frcd thm to contaminate n another.
So we had this vry "d [a] vlet ’", whch is ls sd in wrtng wth an "a", whch, rlly, is ncrrct and mpssbl from th point of view of th processes of th origin nd development of ths wrds.
So, it's crrct to wrt "dvlt" ("to lm vr").
But this wrd is obsolete and in its crrct mnng it is no lngr sd.
If y want to nt that ny crcmstncs/ppl exert a negative mpct on y frm above, use the word "dvt" ("to pprss").
You cn also s the cnstrctn "exert pressure", bt remember tht ths sounds bureaucratic.
