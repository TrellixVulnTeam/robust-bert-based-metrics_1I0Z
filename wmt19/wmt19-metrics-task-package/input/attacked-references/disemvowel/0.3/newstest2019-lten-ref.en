“ We prps that cats and dgs would have to be mrkd with sbctns microchips, nd thr rgstrtn and marking wld be organized by local municipalities, the Mnstry of Agriculture and the Stt Food nd Veterinary Srvc.
In 2019 marking of all dgs, in 2020 also of all cts wld be fndd by the state, therefore, ppl would not hv prblms nd the csts would be covered frm special state fnncl assignments, ” sd Kęstts Mžk, the Chrmn of th Seimas Committee on nvrnmntl Protection.

Th pplctn sys tht the adopted law is contrary to th constitutional principle of the rule of lw.
“ The CC hs indicated fr a number of tms tht legal cts do not apply to ths legal facts nd consequences that occurred before th ffctv date of a nwly adopted legal ct.
In this cs, th Gvrnmnt is given powers to apply th lw rtrctvly, following an indefinite criterion.

Th application to the CC has been sgnd by mmbrs from Seimas TS-LKD, Lbrl Movement, Scl Dmcrtc factions nd by Algirdas Butkevičius, deputy hd of a rlng Scl Dmcrtc Labor faction.

Th right to vote in Lthn is vstd in bt 2.5 million citizens: the half wld mean 1.25 million vtrs, two ffths - n mlln voters.

Sms approved bigger fines fr hrmfl products
Sms pprvd of amendments to the Law on Product Sfty, which prvd that fns fr prdct safety violations must be increased.
The amendments were vtd in fvr of nnmsly.
As ntns Vinkus, a mmbr of th Seimas Cmmtt on Hlth Affairs, sd speaking about the new draft, the fact tht the amendments m at bttr prtctn of product consumers is wlcm.
Bsds, ts provisions are in ln with the requirements of the decision of the European Prlmnt nd of th Cncl.
"I think tht th proposed draft law mks a more prfct nd more specific distribution among ll participants of the supply and distribution prcss: manufacturers, srvc providers, mprtrs, dstrbtrs nd thrs.
Th practice shows tht the crrnt system of fns ds nt lwys prevent further vltns, as entities, having paid fns, continue committing rptd violations, ” A. Vinkus spoke.
Th drft ws prepared by the Mnstry of Economy; ftr the Gvrnmnt ’ s approval, the Seimas Committee on cnmcs added ts own prpsls.
Th amendments to th Law are aimed at increasing fines for violations, rsng protection of consumer rights, giving mr power to mrkt sprvsry authorities and crtng a clr system of requirements fr prdct safety nd supervision vr their cmplnc.
According to the Mnstry of Economy, currently manufacturers r nt sbjct to the obligation to label a prdct prprly nd ths to ensure its trcblty.
Bsds, ccrdng to the ministry, th market supervisory thrts, whch prfrm state control over sfty of products, do not hv th rght to enter manufacturers ’ and spplrs ’ territory, bldngs, premises, to prfrm nspctns, which hndrs th work of the authorities.
Th mnstry hlds that the current trm of sx months for mpstn on fns nd giving of warnings is too short for identifying a violation, mkng an investigation nd mpsng a fine.
Also, according to th ministry, the crrnt fns r not ffcnt enough.
Cmpns ftn rptdly brch rqrmnts of the lw - in 2017 only it was done by 14 companies.
The Ministry of cnmy proposed to establish a duty fr manufacturers to prprly label a prdct nd ths to nsr its traceability, in order to mk it easier for mrkt supervisory thrts to reveal suppliers of nn-cmplnt prdcts.
It is ls proposed tht market supervisory thrts, in prfrmnc of stt control vr product safety, would have the rght to enter th territory, bldngs, prmss of the entities tht prdc, supply products to th mrkt, to perform inspections.
Th amounts of fines fr vltns of the law r gng to be increased.
A manufacturer, mprtr or thrzd rprsnttv that placed dngrs products on the mrkt nd a distributor tht supplied thm to th market, a srvc prvdr wh prvdd or provides dangerous srvcs wld be subject to a fn of EUR 150 to 2,500 (currently, a fine of R 144 to 1,448).
If th State Cnsmr Rghts Prtctn Authority (SCRPA) or nthr market sprvsry thrty decides to prhbt placement nd supply of dngrs products on / to th mrkt or prvsn of dngrs services, a fn of EUR 1,000 to 5,000 (currently, EUR 868 to 4,344) wld be mpsd.
In cs of failure to fulfil th demand to rmv dngrs prdcts from th mrkt, to rcll thm from cnsmrs nd to destroy thm, a fine of R 2,500 to 6,500 (currently, EUR 1,448 to 5,792) would be mpsd.
