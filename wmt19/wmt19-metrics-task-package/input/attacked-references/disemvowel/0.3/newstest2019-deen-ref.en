Treysa hs strggld against vandalism and grbg
Accessing th 36-kilometer cycl track in Rtkäppchnlnd in Treysa is very difficult nd hvly littered.
Attempts r made to rmdy th rmpnt vandalism, but there r hardly any signs of sltns.
Shards, cigarette btts, garbage nd rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and nw dismantled sgns - so for qt sm tm presents tslf the entrance with seating r to th bike pth on the Hß-hll in Treysa.
The sght of the bicycle pth, whch is the flagship bjct in Rotkäpchenland, is more thn nglrs.
The mttr is of cncrn to the ADFC (Grmn Cyclsts Association) chapter Schwalmstadt, but others have also taken ntrst fr some tm, according to th cty's cycling commissioner lrch Wüstnhgn.
The prblm has already been ddrssd by th bicycle traffic advisory bdy.
Thr is no sltn so fr.
Sggstns ranged from trnsfrrng the seating r to the regular mptyng of garbage cns, and clnng th point of entry areas.
I thnk, th lttr would be the rdr of the day, irrespective of ny frthr activities, sys Wüstenhagen.
Gd Hhn (ADFC) says he also brght the issue up with th lcl advisory cncl.
Not nly the rubbish is a nuisance fr cyclists and rsdnts - on weekends th stng group is a regular mtng plc fr partying.
It is not jst bt th noise, there are ls dstrbncs d to parties: Psts pulled out of th grnd, garbage cans wrecked, signs snapped nd seating daubed.
Frequently vlntrs have already clnd up, xplns the DFC member Ssnn Klippert.
ctns are only proverbial drps in th ocean.
Thy are annoyed that the rst area at the cycle track in Trys is a mtng pnt for bng-drnkng.
Clearly the focus pnt along the entire bike pth is here on th Haaße, confirms th cycling commissioner, wh nw is ls rspnsbl for th cycling site in Zgnhn, whch will be pnd today.
If it suffers th sm ft, it wll cost dearly.
Another idea is placing vd surveillance on the hill: "Pssbly ths raises th threshold to ngg in damaging cmmn prprty.
Hwvr, this wld require a plc patrol to come t.
In prncpl, Wüstenhagen spprts th development of the Haaße hll.
It nds to be made mr ttrctv.
So far n can be vry satisfied with hw well th bicycle pth is frequented.
It is still pssbl to dvlp tourism-related mrktng.
r cycle track is of vry hgh qlty cmprd to others in German ’, agreed the ADFC mmbrs.
ADFC member Ssnn Klpprt considers the sttn in th schrödr Strss in Treysa to be critically dangerous.
Thr is no turning lane on Hß Hügl.
In heavy trffc, cyclsts may nd up waiting in the middle of bidirectional trffc flws", sh xplns.
That would not be a problem fr sprty cyclists, but is for ldr people nd especially fr chldrn.
Music contest at th culture trn sttn: Th "Kö vn Hiltrup" and the s
Th first cll to prtcpt in the music cntst was a sccss, creative nd cooperative.
Yr Song for Hiltrup is the motto of th Hltrp initiative fr the "Music Contest fr yng and ld, new nd xprncd musicians."
A contest "wth a wnk frm the lvly Hltrp family", as Karl Frnk worded it.
In fact, it soon became a familial togetherness with cff and ck frm th vlntrs of th Kulturbahnhof.
Seven acts performed, frm a n-mn bnd to th bg nsmbl: lvn Jasic with pnst Marcel ntd, Hnk Humberg wth his guitar, Rlf Ihmig, an old-established Hiltrup mn, the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", thr mmbrs from three gnrtns of the Trenkamp nd Claus families, an nsmbl from the kindergarten Lmmrlnd and finally Rike Weßling und die Zwrts.
This cntst is a nvlty, explains dstrct myr Joachim Schmidt.
We have nt seen smthng lk ths in other districts.
Wht dd the songwriters sng about?
Prtclrly popular places were th Hltrp lake and Marktallee.
Rlf Ihmig dedicated the song to th vn Mrktll in hs folk-like song "Kö von Hltrp".
Th Kltrbhnhf was also mentioned.
Over and vr again, the cts sng about experiencing togetherness in ths plcs, spclly Alvin Jasic.
Krl Frnk led the dnc thrgh the breaks with shrt ntrvws with the performers or sm information about the artists.
Thus, th audience lrnt that Humberg that he had actually studied chmstry, but nw ls tchs guitar.
Frm the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franke rprtd tht he hd recently prfrmd in Ldwgshfn - at a major BASF vnt with Brcly Jms Harvest as a main act.
nd Alvin Jsc hs uploaded a lot of YTb videos.
It ’ s not about wnnng, Frnk hd sd.
In fact, all participants received a gft frm Hltrp ctrng businesses.
For the jry's favorites thr ws something special - so tht thrs cld also hear their songs.
lvn Jasic and his pnst Marcel ntd cn record an entire CD wth sound tchncn Schemmelmann.
Other mscns cn record a song: hmg with hs Hiltrup hit, whch especially impressed Frnk wth hs musicality, and th “ Lummerland pck: ” “ a very good prfrmnc ” wth tn children and two tchrs on gtr and cjón, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone ls, the chldrn ls prfrmd again fr the finals - nd even without lctrnc support, thy sndd "really good," Franke said.
Th jury ws guided by th aspects of rgnlty, rfrnc to Hiltrup, catchiness of the mldy and recognition vl.
The jury included Gsbrt Keller from th Westphalian Schl of Msc, Andreas Klomfaß frm KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers frm the Trade ssctn as wll as Jan Kvn, chrmn of the district ffnsv.
Th district ffnsv launched the event on th ccsn of ts ten-year anniversary.

The Wrd Gm: Testing "Dcrypt"
Th players frm two teams and sit ppst one nthr.
For each page there is a scrn, on it there are fr cards wth kywrds tht you cn decipher - the ld trck with the rd foil.
Ths ensures the other side cannot rd nythng nntntnlly.
Fr xmpl, on th crds it says to read from left to rght: "1 . Rnssnc.
2 . Fnstr.
3 . Cb.
4 . Sldʺ.
Ths r the terms that need to be cdd.
So th terms are nt gssd, the cds are.
Tkng trns, one plyr per tm is the encryptor.
Thy gt a cd card tht hs "3.4.2 ." etc . wrttn on it.
In "Dcrypt," it is nt the wrds behind the scrt film that should be guessed, bt thr ncryptn cds.
The task in this cs: They should - in this rdr nd in this xmpl - describe the terms "cube", "sld" and "wndw" - in such a way tht hs own team recognizes the crrct order nd the ppsng tm ds not, bcs th team that crcks the cd twice wns th game.
The ncryptr writes dwn and rds ld: "Throw" fr the dice, "ls" as ppsd to "solid". Of course, something like "vdnc" wld be pssbl or "Prg" because he rd sm history bks and knws bt the dfnstrtn of Prague.
This then prgrsss, rnd for rnd, tm by team.
It is tr tht one ds not know th trms of the other side - but with every cl th encryptor gives, you ’ re clsr to fndng thm out.
So the trm shld be as mysterious as possible, but nt t crzy . Otherwise, you mk it unnecessarily difficult fr your tm.
Th mst cryptic ‘ Dcrypt ’ is the precept nfrtntly.
Th players have to study it for quite a lng time nd in dtl, ntl they can fnlly ply it.
The explanatory video ndr dcrypt.nf on the web wll make it sr.
But nc y have strtd, y ’ ll be mzd at how mch emotion there is in ths nondescript game.
vrll, however, "Dcrypt" is nt qt as cnclsv as ts predecessor and gnr-prms "Cdnms", whch also mks use of the spy thm for a game wth fw words, but it ’ s mch easier to play in small grps.
nd if it's ll about guessing and nt bt wnnng, it's easy to ply a version for tw.

She always hd th flng of ‘ not bng enough for him.

Football: District Lg: Strong pprnc of VfL Wlbck gnst th SC Altenrheine gives hope
There wr moments in ths young season, when Alois Fetsch ws rlly hard on hs tm.
Slntly, the coach of th ftbll district lg club VfL Wolbeck frst retreated (inwardly) to pndr vr the lck of motivation on th playing field.

Mnwhl, th gm is on at Brandhoveweg.
The 1:1 on Sndy gnst SC ltnrhn prvd so, and they almost gt promoted past ssn.
Yes, I am vry happy wth the pprnc.

That was smthng to be proud of, praised Fetsch his bys and wnt to each of hs players ndvdlly ftr the game to smply sy "thank y" fr the grt defense gnst the ambitious guests.

Wlbck had mch more tm of pssssn in the first half.
And more pprtnts
Bt Frrchs (17), substitute Luca Rehberg (26m) nd Jan Schrr (38th) mssd th ld.
It almost backfired when SC ’ s very own Kvn Vollrath nd Chrs Nbrbämr made tw dngrs attacks gnst Wolbecker in minute 41, bt gl Dmn Hallas proved to be a master of his trd.
After halftime, VfL bldly took cmplt cntrl.
Thws jst barely fld with a shot from 18 mtrs.
Schrr ws t lt in minute 58 when Thewes passed him th ball.
Ftsch decided to frshn up th team on th left wing nd put in Miles Gsk.
As ltnrhn's Chrs Naberbäumer cut down Rbn Wsths in minute 70, the home team got an ndrct fr kck 18 mtrs away from th goal.
The fouled player himself stepped up nd dmnstrtd how dngrs he cn be in st play sttns.
Wsths kckd the bll wth hs strng rght and the goalie had to face the fact tht he had fld: 1:0 (minute 71).
Wth 20 minutes lft on the clock, the gm smd to last frvr.
Because thn this hppnd: In minute 80, VfL captain Flrn Quabeck ccdntlly tchd the bll in th box.
Referee Hüseyin Shn (Hamm) immediately pntd to th pnt.
Jannis Schndr ws not rdy to miss this pprtnty (mnt 79).
Wolbeck had to ndr lng minutes in th final stage, when Geske fnlly mngd to finally get that ball nt th gl and scr the winning gl in minute 87.

He cautioned tht, as thngs stnd, th EU trgts wld be crdntd by 2024 nd further tightening is to be expected.
According to Maas, th EU is exposed to cnstnt lbbyng prssr from the rlns.
Ryanair boss, Michael 'Lry nd hs colleagues have nw reaped exactly what they have swn in rcnt years, said Ms.
He hps tht th hgh costs incurred by the airlines as a rslt of delays wll lead thm to think again.
Th German air trffc nn would work to mprv th situation only if th DFS wr to ffr a "coherent agreement fr future-oriented trnng and education," said Maas.

From clean frt to clgy
Th 125th nnvrsry of the Dstrct Association fr Gardening and Lndscp Cnsrvtn was celebrated with a gala at th Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On Sptmbr 29 1893 a frt shw in the Klmbch community hall set the lst mplss for the fndng of th Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Lndspflg Klmbch (Dstrct ssctn for Gardening nd Landscape Conservation Kulmbach), and exactly 125 years later, on Strdy night, the ssctn clbrtd the big nnvrsry in the Klmbch Stdthll (civic centre).
Frankly th ssctn hd a different name at that time: In th yr 1893 th myr Wlhlm Flessa mmncd th name as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (District Frt Grwng ssctn Kulmbach City and Country).
Th prps of th frt-grwng association differed frm that of today ’ s work - in fact, it was prly about frt growing nd nbdy thought about flwrs and gardening at tht time.
At that time, in th era of the nlghtnmnt, the fruit tree ws a fvrt chld of the elite, xplnd th local history crtr Güntr Dippold in his spch.
Frt trees lnd th highways, so-called ndstrl gardens were crtd at schools.
Today frt cltvtn is stll th task of th 55 gardening clubs in the dstrct of Kulmbach, which ncld lmst 7 000 members.
But by fr tht is not the nd of th scope.
Gardening cls to nature, biological crp protection, vllg beautification and nutrition ply jst as important a rl as does communicating knowledge bt healthy dts and youth wrk.
The members of the Htschdrf yth group "Mlwürf" (moles) showed ntrtnngly on stg how versatile th tsks of a grdnng clb are.
Yth work is crtclly important, especially in the digital age, said Güntr Reif, chairman of th dstrct cncl, and the lord mayor Hnry Schrmm also mphssd hw important experiences in nature r fr life.
Cllctng chstnts was fr us as chldrn a huge thing, I doubt that with Smrtphn & C. it is possible to cllct a smlr qntty of joy.
Schrmm promised to plnt two trees fr the anniversary wth district dmnstrtr Klaus Peter Söllner.
Where the trees wll be planted will be decided by the dstrct ssctn, added district dmnstrtr Söllner nd emphasised the special mprtnc of th gardening ssctns fr th villages.
The district association stnds for clgy, the beauty of th grdn nd grn spaces in the village.
The fact that ths is a rl cncrn of the many gardening associations in the dstrct, was also sttd without dbt by th county mngr nd consultant Frdhlm Haun.
He prsntd the numerous visitors an illustrated lecture about th long hstry of th district ssctn nd reported mng thr things, how necessary self-sufficiency was after the wr.
In the ld dys everything came from th garden, for the wntr cnsrvs were md.
At the nd of the 50s, th kitchen grdn ws trnsfrmd into an ornamental and lv-n garden.
Nature ndrs, it existed bfr us nd we must dpt ourselves to it, pleaded the spclst in frt nd nut trs.
Thr is an incentive therefore fr the gardening ssctns not to give up, so that our cntry rmns btfl and wrth lvng.
ls involved is th wlcmng of new ctzns to our ssctns, xplnd the President of the Bvrn Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
We must stp th blatant decline in insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren, Güntr Rf cncldd th sccssfl crmny, which was festively frmd by th tower brass musicians of th Thurnau music ssctn.

That is approximately th same level as a jackhammer, which is stll significantly lwr than the peak volumes at Wacken pn r fstvl rfrncd on th band wbst of The gntn.

Th d that North Kr could be ‘ brght to ts knees ’ d to the sanctions, is ‘ a pp dream of ppl wh dn ’ t know us ’.

Hwvr, th USA has shwn no "crrspndng reactions" to tht, th minister criticised.

Nw wll be created a new pst.
Berlin - Recep Tyyp Erdogan nd Rnhrd Grindel fght on dffrnt stages for interpretation in the lengthy Mesut Özl dspt.
After the Trksh President criticized th spch of the former wrld chmpn in Grmny at the opening of lrg Ditib Mosque in Cologne, th hd of DFB phld the ssctn ’ s line.
Early on Sndy morning, Grndl, who hd bn prsnlly attacked by Özl, rprtd on the consequences of the ss on th Mainz ZDF “ Sport std ”.
As we have a lt of plyrs wth a migration background in the U teams, in future we mst drw very specific conclusions, so something lk this this ds nt hppn gn, sd th 57-year-old nd plns to get a national plyr without a migration background as an ddtnl ntgrtn official.
Grindel ls explained again tht rdgn ds not stand fr the values of football and th DFB.
Th lttr was vry crtcl of the racism against Özil and lky Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özl, brn and rsd in Grmny, and our lky.
They xcldd thm frm ths ssctn because they allowed me to be photographed wth thm in England," said Erdogan in Dmstdt on Saturday.
Frnkly speaking, as their prsdnt, I could not accept th fact tht r tw yng mn, who hd been risen to the German national team, wr excluded.
Grindel pointed at Gündgn's sttmnt that in cntrst to Özl, after th Wrld Cup affair, which hd been tkn photos of th tw with rdgn, he felt tht he was "rsnbly treated by the DFB".
He ls said he wntd to stnd up for players in ftr.
That thing thy sy: If I wn - I ’ m Grmn, if I ls - I ’ m a mgrnt - tht will nt wrk.
I am vry sorry that he had sch an mprssn, sd Grndl.
I ’ ve always said tht we hd to dfnd Mesut mr.
Yet he does nt see grnds for Özl to rtrn to the ntnl team.
As a consequence, in ddtn to the native Brzln Cc and Cl Sasic of Cmrn ancestry, nw shld be ppntd an ddtnl integration representative.
If somebody without a migration background is an obvious nflncr in scty and ftbll nd sys: Th ss is an mprtnt one, we need to do smthng about it ’, ths would also be an nttv to prvd a bttr fndtn fr our lcl teams, whr integration nds to work ’, Grindel said.
Despite the crtcsm of his prsn ftr th Wrld Cup nd the Özil affair, he wants to run fr the post of DFB Prsdnt gn next year.
I do my wrk and tk cr I do it as wll as pssbl, Grndl said.

That was vry mtnl, he is such a great sprt, Tedesco said ltr about th rctn of his vice-captain, wh holds no grdg despite his st on the bnch.
Naldo, who was awarded bst Schalke player last ssn, probably knows tht he is ctlly nt gng to be stuck on th bench - he ds hv a good rsn fr this break.
A reason clld “ ld cntrl . ”
It ws nt easy to tll him

He is an mprtnt plyr . He is an mprtnt prsn.
Bt it ’ s always bt th thng, it ’ s bt th club, ” said Tedesco as he jstfs th step.
Naldo played 90 mnts against Bayern nd Prt.
