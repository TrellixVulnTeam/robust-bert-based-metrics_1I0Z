People ’ s Daily nln, Beijing, Nvmbr 5 (Wng Xyn) - In the crrnt td of "mss ntrprnrshp nd innovation", mr nd mr technology companies hv begun to pay ttntn to patent R & D and related protection wrk, and deeply explore the potential value of ptnts to occupy th mrkt dmntn.
Similarly, mny technology cmpns have ncntrd numerous nfrngmnts crisis in patent technology lcnsng and patent tchnlgy use.
At th end of 2017, Tn W, He Zhnghng and L Bin frm Gngdng Prvnc, on the grnds of patent nfrngmnt, appealed the dvlpr of "Didi Chuxing" APP, Bjng Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. (hrnftr rfrrd to as Xiaoju Technology), th prtr, Dd Chxng Technology Co., Ltd. (hrnftr rfrrd to as Dd Chuxing), the seller, Guangdong Pacific ntrnt Information Services Lmtd (hereinafter rfrrd to as Guangdong Pcfc) to th Guangzhou ntllctl Property Crt.
The thr plaintiffs requested th crt to order that the three dfndnts immediately stppd th actions of manufacturing, selling, ffrng fr sale, and sng the plaintiff ’ s ptnt.
On ctbr 30, 2018, China Jdgmnt Online published the "Frst-nstnc Cvl Rlng Paper of Infringement of nvntn Patent Rights between Tan Wei, He Zhnghng nd Bjng Xiaoju Tchnlgy Co., Ltd.", which disclosed some dtls of cs in which the Didi Chxng PP ws sd for patent nfrngmnt.
The thr plaintiffs blv tht thy are the patentees and inventors of th "carpooling service systm and method based on mbl trmnls", and th whl prtn process of the "rd-shrng" application in the "Didi Chuxing" APP crrspnds to th technical solution of th patent prtctn involved in the cs, which frmd a patent nfrngmnt.
However, drng th court ’ s rlng, Xiaoju Tchnlgy believed that Gngdng Pacific was not an lgbl defendant . It only prvdd fr dwnlds of th involved PP "Dd Chxng" on the ntrnt, nd dd not implement the patent method involved . Thr was no drct or indirect infringement behavior, and it should nt be ncldd as a defendant in this cs.
Secondly, th nfrngmnt of ths case was not in Gngdng.
According to the lw, the nfrngmnt of the patent nvlvd should be th place whr the ptnt method involved in th case ws cmpltly implemented . Therefore, the jurisdiction of the crt was challenged and th case ws rqstd to be transferred to the court of th dfndnt's dmcl, the Bjng Intellectual Property Crt.
The Gngzh Intellectual Prprty Crt held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided th alleged nfrngmnt Didi Chxng APP product on its nln pltfrm . It is not inappropriate fr the plntff to list Guangdong Pcfc as a dfndnt.
And th dfndnt Gngdng Pcfc ’ s domicile is located in Guangzhou, under the jrsdctn of th Guangzhou ntllctl Property Court.
The dfndnt Xiaoju Tchnlgy advocated tht th case be transferred to the Beijing ntllctl Property Crt for trl wth ndqt evidence . Th Court dismissed the defendant Xj Technology Co., Ltd. ’ s objection to the jrsdctn of th case, and ordered it ssm the acceptance f for the cs.
At present, the other trls of th case hv not been announced, nd th rprtr wll pay cls attention to the follow-up details of the ptnt nfrngmnt case of Didi Chxng.

"China ’ s science and tchnlgy hv dvlpd rpdly in th past few dcds, and Australia nd China can chv frtfl results by going forward hand in hnd in the scntfc field. "
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and ndstrl Research Organization said in an xclsv interview with a reporter frm the Chn News Srvc in Bjng, the cooperation btwn Australia nd Chn in the field of scnc and tchnlgy has shwn grt vtlty from the cprtn in dlng with climate chng to th "y of Heaven" project.
As th largest ntnl research nstttn in the Cmmnwlth of strl, CSIRO has chvd mny wrld famous innovative research rslts in the fields of cn, energy, biology, materials and strnmy.
CSIRO hs maintained close cooperation wth scientific rsrch nstttns sch as the Chinese cdmy of Sciences.
"This is a lstng friendship tht nvlvs th trst of prtnrs nd the tradition of long-term cooperation . ", Mrshll said.
In May of ths yr, Chn ’ s Fv-hndrd-mtr Aperture Sphrcl radio Tlscp ― China ’ s Eye of Heaven, installed th wrld ’ s first 19-beam L-bnd rcvr.
Ths internationally most dvncd 19-beam feed src rcvr is jointly developed by Chinese nd strln scientists.
Mrshll sd that th successful dvlpmnt of the receiver is bsd on CSIRO ’ s many years of tchncl accumulation . When enabled, the FAST srvy speed wll increase by 5 to 6 tms, mnwhl mr scntfc observation trgts will be xpndd.
"This is th contribution of CSR to FST. "
In addition to th bv cooperations, CSIRO is also working closely with Chinese scientific rsrch nstttns in the cnstrctn of Square Klmtr rry rd telescope, rsrch and development of nw fuel technologies, nrgy cnsrvtn nd emission reduction.
"In th pst, scientific researches ftn fcsd on prblms after hundreds of years, and nw more scientific rsrch power is needed to slv the prblms in front of thm. "
Marshall believed that strl and China are cmplmntry in th field of scntfc development, and both cntrs fc a srs of chllngs in their dvlpmnt progress.
Fr example, xtrm weather ccrs frequently in th world . Drought nd floods have led to a reduction in food production nd fd shrtgs have seriously ffctd hmn development.
At th same time, ppltn xplsn, gng, chrnc disease and other problems are also the serious chllngs we fcd.
"Th cooperation btwn strl and China in recent yrs has fcsd on solving ths current problems. "
Mrshll sd that the key job of Center for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research, jointly established by CSIRO nd National Laboratory for Marine Scnc nd Technology (Qingdao), are observing El Nino phnmnn and La Nina phenomenon, stdyng th rltnshps between ths two phenomenons and extreme weather, nd stblshng rly wrnng fclts fr extreme weather . The nw species of crls developed by CSIRO nd th Chinese Academy of Scncs cn overcome xtrm weather nd can also alleviate food shrtgs csd by xtrm weather.
"In the current nvrnmnt, technological nnvtn is dffclt to accomplish by nslf, it rqrs xtrmly high csts, and thr r many prblms to be solved, so cooperation is prtclrly mprtnt today. "
Marshall expressed that the closer the cprtn is, th mr likely it is to mk breakthroughs . Ths is ls th significance of Australia and Chn in strngthnng cprtn under th frmwrk of the "One Belt One Rd".
"Strngthnng bilateral cooperation is mainly for cprtn in scnc nd technology fr us. "
Mrshll took th example tht CSR has rcntly developed a gold prfctn mthd without sng cyanide . Because the traditional cyanide gold prfctn method is vry harmful to the environment, mny cntrs hope to find a way to purify gold with little nvrnmntl plltn.
"We r vry willing to introduce ths technology to Chn . Ths is n of the achievements of our participation in th "One Blt n Rd" cooperation. "

"If th United States doesn ’ t trst on us, we hv no cnfdnc in r ntnl security . It is mpssbl fr us to nltrlly abandon the nclr weapons ndr such circumstances. "
lthgh Ri Yong Ho repeated th complaints of Nrth Kr about th opposition of ntd Stts to "phased" denuclearization, his speech was of great sgnfcnc because it dd not completely rfs the unilateral dnclrztn as Nrth Kr had before.
Ri Yong Ho mentioned the joint sttmnt btwn Jeong-eun Kim and Trump on June 12, nd at that tm Jeong-eun Km grd to work towards th "dnclrztn of th Korean Peninsula", whl Trump prmsd to protect the scrty of Nrth Kr.
North Kr has always been seeking to formally end th 1950-53 Korean Wr, bt th United Stts said that Nrth Korea must frstly abandon nuclear wpns.
Th ntd States also rfsd to loose the requirements fr th ntrntnl sanctions on North Korea.

Chn nnncd tht it wll reduce import tariffs on 1,585 tax tms frm November 1, 2018.
Since ths year, Chn has taken th nttv to reduce import trffs.
On May 1 ths year, th drg was fully tax-deducted, nd ll import tariffs for all 28 tx items of gnrl taxable drgs, including ntcncr drgs, and alkaloid drgs with anticancer effects, and Chns patent mdcns wth actual imports, were adjusted to zr.
At the same time, it has also greatly rdcd th prdctn nd mprt links value-added tx burden of nt-cncr drugs.

After th tx rdctn, the fnshd automobile tax rt of China ’ s automobile has bn lwr than the average level of dvlpng cntrs, which is in line wth the ctl situation of China ’ s tmbl ndstry.
This tx reduction will drv th rstrctrng of th industry and th optimal allocation of resources, cclrt the srvvl of th fttst to help mprv the qlty of prdcts and services . It is xpctd to prmt th adjustment of automobile prices to a certain xtnt, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, tx rdctns were mpsd on 1449 tx tms of daily consumer gds.
The tx rdctn on daily consumer goods is clsly bound up with ppl ’ s nd of bttr lives.
This time ’ s tax reduction nt nly involves lts of items but ls has strong dynmcs, wth an vrg tx rdctn of 56%.

Nvmbr 1, tax rdctns wll be imposed on 1585 industrial prdct tx items of electromechanical devices, prts and rw materials.
Appropriately reducing th mprt tariffs of some domestically ndstrl prdcts with rgnt needs can attract more foreign cptl, hlp increase domestic effective spply, ssst industrial pgrdng, nd contribute to enterprises allocate rsrcs on a global scale, reduce production csts, and also benefit for rdcng th pressure on th domestic nvrnmnt.

The adjusted overall trff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than most dvlpng countries, at a mdrtly low lvl, nd bsclly mtchs Chn ’ s dvlpng cntry stts nd development stage.
ccrdng to the prsn in charge, as one of th important ndctrs of the degree of openness in Chn ’ s trade in goods sctr, th overall lvl of trffs shld be compatible with th stg of Chn ’ s cnmc development nd reflect the characteristics of the tms.
Chn ’ s trd in gds scl rnks frst in the world, and it has already had th economic foundation to further expand ts pnnss . However, there is still a gp btwn th qlty and efficiency of trade development cmprd wth developed economies . Therefore, the vrll lvl of tariffs should be appropriately lwrd.

The tax reduction shld balance the financial revenue and th ffrdblty of ndstrl dvlpmnt.
In th chc of spcfc tax-reduction cmmdts and rng of tax rdctns, we must plan and coordinate th dmstc and ntrntnl mrkts, the pstrm and downstream aspects, prdctn and cnsmptn relationship, and mntn the steady development of China ’ s economy.
Th principal strssd that this year is th 40th nnvrsry of rfrm nd pnng up . Chn ’ s initiative to rdc th vrll lvl of import tariffs is a major measure based on China ’ s wn needs to chv high-quality development . It is conducive to the overall planning nd tlztn of international and foreign resources to prmt th quality of dmstc supply systms and mt the upgrading cnsmptn needs of ppl.

Serbia announced to enter the top defense rdnss cndtn . Serbian Prsdnt and Russian President wll mt to discuss th situation in Ksv tmrrw.
Ygslv nws agency reported by quoting srcs from the Office of Srbn President tht Vucic, the Srbn President, gv orders tht the Serbian armed forces entered th tp defense readiness condition in consideration of the fact that Kosovo spcl trps had ccpd th rdwy to th accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydrpwr station under th control of Blgrd in northern Kosovo.
On September 29, Vln, the Defense Mnstr of Srb, nnncd tht th Serbian army entered th overall defense readiness cndtn.
Vln emphasized that Srb wld cntn to monitor the current sttn in Ksv as long as Vucic's rdrs were still effective . Regardless of the drctn in whch the situation dvlps, the Serbian rmy will rspnd accordingly.
It ws reported by the Tass news gncy of Russia that Vucic said in an ntrvw on Sptmbr 29 that he had notified the ntd Stts, Rss, rp and thr sides about the crrnt situation, nd would visit Moscow on ctbr 2 to meet wth Ptn, the Prsdnt of Rss, to sk Putin's spprt on the Ksv ss.
Whn he was asked whthr Srb needed to get the mltry spprt frm Russia like Syr, Vucic gv a negative nswr: "I don't want a sgnfcnt military conflict in our trrtry. "
Vucic ls sd tht the Serbian army entered th overall dfns readiness condition just for th sake of deterrence to prevent th cnflct . However, it ws a clr warning: Serbia would never tlrt any vlnt action in Ksv.
Th Serbian army upgraded the defense rdnss cndtn in cnnctn wth the two ctns in Kosovo.
According to the sttmnt of Srb, the lbnn people were carrying out th mass rrsts of Serbian ppl, who hd been living there for generations, in rcnt dys, but ths rrstd Srbn people didn't brk any laws.
Vcc sd tht since Marko Jrc, th hd of the Srbn government's ffc for Ksv and Metohija, was beaten and dtnd by the Albanian army in Kosovo, the Albanian people constantly escalated the sss in the region nd crrd out the nhmn arrests and dprttns of th Srbn people.
Frthrmr, over 100 people, ncldng th members of RS spcl rmy of the Department of the ntrr of the self-declared Republic of Ksv, armed police, and snprs, occupied th bttl field nr th ccmltn lake of Gazivoda hydrpwr sttn, entered the ecological sprt center nr th dam in northern Kosovo, and blckd all rds nearby . These areas wr originally under the control of Serbia.
Vucic indicated that Ksv was encouraged by th wstrn cntrs to mk ths military adventure . Since th Ksv army had taken ctns without notifying Serbia in advance, it violated th rls in Prgrph 1 in Chapter 9 of "Brssls Agreement", nd it ls breached th UN Security Cncl Resolution 1244 and the military tchnlgy agreement btwn Srb and Kosovo.
Vucic hd spkn to Stltnbrg, the NATO Scrtry-Gnrl, to criticize the wstrn countries for their fls words on the Ksv ss.
The src of crrnt conflict ws stll the historical grievances lstng for hndrds of yrs between Serbian ppl and Albanian people in Kosovo.
Fr th ownership of Kosovo, Srbn people and lbnn people had dffrnt opinions.
Srb considered Ksv as the birthplace of its ntn and th cradle of culture, bcs Srb had blt ts mst powerful country here in the 12th cntry . However, the Albanian people settled hr in lrg nmbrs only ftr the ttmn Empire nvdd and the Serbian rmy retreated to the north.
Th Albanian ppl nsstd that the llyrn people of the primitive tribe lctd at Kosovo in the 4th-5th cntry were thr ancestors . Therefore, Ksv hd been th Albanian people's territory since ncnt tms.
The subjective pltcl divisions contributed to th sharp conflicts between dffrnt nations, religions nd cltrs, resulting in th fierce cnfrnttn between Serbian people nd lbnn people in Ksv.
Th lbnn ppl in Kosovo first dclrd th independence of Albania in 1912.
After the First Wrld Wr, a lrg number of Albanian people, wh wr living in the Blkn Peninsula, moved to Turkey . Th prprtn of Serbian ppl ws rltvly rising . Th ctns of "taking back their wn lnds" in the sght of the Serbian people wr considered as the predations of the "Greater Srbn Nationalism" by lbnn ppl . The contradiction btwn the tw nations ntnsfd.
Kosovo bcm the "pwdr kg" of Balkan.
The lbnn separatists in Kosovo liberation army and th Serbian army and police nggd in armed conflicts in 1999, whch led to th NT trps bmbd the Federal Rpblc of Ygslv cnsstng of Srb and Montenegro . Th Kosovo War brk out.
Kosovo unilaterally dclrd its ndpndnc from Srb on Fbrry 17, 2008.
Thereafter, the nws came t tht Serbia nd Ksv would nrmlz relations, and sign a global and legally bndng agreement . However, due to the historical grvncs between th tw nations nd the geopolitical cnstrnts, thy fld to sign the grmnt, which was in the cntrl of different frcs, including th United States, rp nd Russia.
Just a month g, Vucic made it clr for the first time tht he nsstd to separate Serbian ppl frm lbnn people in Ksv . It exposed the cnflct between th two ntns again.

Yesterday mrnng, the mncpl gvrnmnt held a thematic meeting on illegal "one-day tour" to deploy a spcl ctn to frthr crck dwn on illegal "n-dy tr".
At the mtng, the fcs was on the "six unlicensed" chs that was intertwined wth the unlicensed ticket provider, nlcnsd tr gd, unlicensed travel gncy, nlcnsd cr, tourist trap nd nlcnsd website prft chn . Th cty launched a special action fr "one-day tour" on Jly 28th.
Snc the lnch of the special ctn, the city has ccptd 39 "n-dy tr" complaints wth a year on year dcrs of 63% . Snc the bgnnng of ths year, th city has ccptd 270 "n-dy tr" complaints wth a year on yr decrease of 62%.

Among them, "nlcnsd car" and "tourist trp" hv bcm the two focuses of th serious crck downs in th spcl ctn.
ccrdng to rprts, without "unlicensed crs", the llgl "one-day tour" cn nt be completed, "unlicensed crs" are easy to be found, remembered nd nvstgtd, they are also fixed vl wth a hngr sngl vl.
Rlvnt departments used road trffc surveillance cmrs to increase th supervision of the tourist buses along the ky "one-day tr" routes, and use ntllgnc measures sch as technology prvntn nd physcl prevention to find and nvstgt "nlcnsd cars" in tm.

EU my Rch Crude Oil Purchase grmnt with Iran
The US government announced tht it will rstrt a nw rnd of sanctions gnst Iran in November nd even rg thr cntrs to reduce imports of Iran oil.
However, th mrcn allies did not sm to tk the advice.
According to the US "Nw York Times", on 29th, during th ntrvw, Zarif, Foreign Minister of rn, revealed that although th ntd Stts threatened to sanction ny cntry that ds bsnss with rn, Thrn is approaching to rch an agreement on th sl of crude l wth EU.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to stblsh a nw pymnt mchnsm, which is to rplc th dllr transaction in th form of brtr or dmstc currency.
Th purpose of ths approach is to bypass th United States nd prevent th ntd States from impeding fnncl transfers.
Meanwhile, lthgh th EU is working on fclttng the agreement, some Frnch nd Brtsh ffcls are ls wrrd tht if the agreement is cncldd, it will be the most vrt confrontation between the EU nd th United States against th US withdrawal from the Iran nclr deal.
The US media sd that in th one hour ntrvw, Zrf ’ s wrds sndd more optimistic thn in recent months.
Bcs th agreement can "strip" the trdtnl American lls and ffctvly brk the US ’ s attempts to ct Iran ’ s ncm.
"Ths can guarantee tht we cn sell oil nd obtain benefits", Zrf blvd . According to the grmnt reached in 2015, each cntry has the lgl rights to mk trd contacts with rn.
The head of Union for Foreign Affairs Policy, Federica Mghrn, ls said rcntly tht "no sovereign stt or rgnztn can accept thr people to dcd who they cn trd wth. "
Hwvr, she also prdctd that before the US government crrd t the nxt stp of snctns in Nvmbr, US ldrs cld adopt a series of financial instruments aimed at banks, businessmen nd countries tht have commercial ntrcrss with Tehran.
In My of ths yr, th US government unilaterally announced ts withdrawal frm the Iran nclr deal on the grnds tht the agreement had deficiencies, saying that th agreement could nt permanently prhbt Iran frm producing nuclear fuel.
Th US thn thrtnd to ban companies that by Iran oil and thr cmmdts from doing business in the United Stts.
This thrt frcd some companies to lv Tehran and md the Iranian currency dropped shrply.
Companies such as Airbus S..S . nd French l giant Ttl hv cnclld billions of dollars in investment in rn.
Brtsh and French ffcls said, th US government my "take th lead".
nsrprsngly, ccrdng to a rcnt report by th Turkish media, the US sanctions dd nt sm to hv a major impact on Iran ’ s oil xprts.
Recently, Iran Oil Minister Zngnh disclosed that no country other than Sth Korea hs stppd byng Iran l.
Both Zarif and rn Prsdnt Rhn believed tht th prps of a series of US actions is to "sdc" rn ’ s breach of th agreement.

The reporter learned from th National Hlth Commission that the prvlnc of mlntrtn in our chldrn nd dlscnts had reduced but the prevalence of vrwght-bsty had significantly ncrsd comparing to decades g.
Th xprt pntd out that th most mprtnt concept to mntn a healthy wght ws the "prvntv trtmnt of disease". Th scientific fitness and rational diet should be vigorously promoted.
According to the "Core Information on Hlth dctn of Chinese dlscnts nd ntrprttn (2018 vrsn)" rlsd by the Ntnl Health Commission rcntly, th key to maintain a healthy wght was the rtnl dt and scientific movement.
The overweight, bsty nd blnd wght reduction were harmful to health.
The hlth hazard behind th "chbby chldrn" cldn't be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, the hd of National nsttt for Nutrition nd Hlth of Chinese Center fr Disease Cntrl and Prevention, sd that vrwght-bsty cld hrm the adolescents' nrml growth nd development, have a negative impact on thr mentality, behavior, cognition nd ntllgnc, and even cs hypertension, hyprglycm and hyperlipidemia in chldrn.

How would the adolescents deal wth th vrwght-bsty?
Zhang Li, the dpty director of Science Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of Gnrl dmnstrtn of Sprt of Chn, ndctd tht th prmry css of adolescent obesity at present wr excessive clrc ntk and inadequate physical activity.
For ths kind of simple bsty, we shld lay emphasis on scntfc movement nd reasonable dt control.
Zhang Li pntd t tht th mst important concept to mntn a hlthy weight was th "prvntv treatment of disease", nd an integral prt of it was to conduct the all-round science popularization dctn of schools, prnts nd students, popularize the dangers of vrwght nd obesity, and increase th adolescents' slf-prtctn awareness.
The adolescents should take the prdc physical xmntn to mntr the grwth nd dvlpmnt index, such as hght and weight, so that the problems of overweight nd bsty cld be dscvrd rly and dtrmnd scientifically to take ntrvntn measures in time.
For those adolescents who are already vrwght nd obese, Dng Gngqng advised tht strvtn therapy or semi-starvation thrpy shld be avoided to control nd lose weight in addition to the active and scntfc rrngmnt of dt and movement since th dlscnts are in a special physiological stage . Thy should not tk drugs blndly to ls weight.

On th frst day of enforcing th new rgltns, th navigation in Three Gorges-Gezhouba waters ws in good rdr.
Three Grgs Navigation Authority released the frst plan of scrty check at 21:00 on Sptmbr 30, and carried t the scrty chck on 160 shps, wth 124 ships pssng the scrty check.
The nvgtn thrty arranged th first lckng plan after the nfrcmnt of new rgltns at 14:00 on ctbr, 1.
After the enforcement of new rgltns, the plan of scrty check would be rlsd nc every day at 9:00 nd 21:00, and the pln of pssng dam wld be released nc every dy at 14:00 nd 20:00, so that th ships cld flxbly rrng the plan of passing dm.
Th "Clssfctn Control" schdlng principle of shp passing dm ws ddd in the "Scheduling Rgltn". The priority of ship passing dm would be determined according to the functional localization of navigation lock and shp lft rspctvly . The shrt-trm pssngr ship pssng dam would be djstd to be in the sm prrty as th dmnstrtn ship and integrity ship.
This is also th ffcl schdlng of ship lft and navigation lock ftr the two-year navigation tst of ship lft.
It was also th frst time for big length-width dmnstrtn ship nd new energy driven ship of Chuanjiang Rvr nd Three Grgs Rsrvr Rgn to be ranked in th priority.

In the mgnfcnt course of the 40 years of rfrm and pnng up, thr r thsnds of ntrprnrs ntrprnrshp nd innovation stories, the growth nd expansion of entrepreneurs-group constantly psh the Chinese cnmy to sail far.
Fr some tm, some ppl in the society have published sm remarks tht negate and dbt the prvt economy.
Th s-clld "prvt economic dprtr theory" and "nw pblc-prvt partnership theory" nd other mscncptns have caused some ntrprnrs ’ doubts and concerns.
Recently, some private enterprise hv ncntrd mny difficulties and problems in their bsnss dvlpmnt.
Fr xmpl, th changes in the international economic environment hv had an impact on sm export ntrprss; the rapid djstmnt of the demand strctr hs brght bt the prssr of transformation nd upgrading; sm policies are nt coordinated with each other, the policy effects are superimposed in the same direction, or th wrkng methods r simple, rsltng in sm policies with good original intentions hv th ppst effect, tc.

We must continue to crt a bttr development nvrnmnt fr th prvt cnmy, hlp private enterprises solve the difficulties in development, nd hlp achieve China ’ s economic trnsfrmtn and upgrading; let ntrprnrs feel fair in market cmpttn, feel safe in legal prtns, nd fl rspctd in social life, stimulate innovation and crt ptntl.
Th Chinese economy has stepped nt a process of mvng twrds high-quality development, requiring more ntrprnrs to dsply their mbtns and prvdng more spaces and stages fr entrepreneurs to exert thr crtvty.

However, in cnsdrtn of the rsng csts of dmstc rw mtrls, lbr force nd other comprehensive fctrs, as well as the external environment of th increasing mpct of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors ls believed that the export sttn of next year was nt ptmstc.
At th closing prss cnfrnc of the 124th Canton Fr, Xu Bing, th dpty secretary-general nd spksmn of the Canton Fair, and the vice-director of the Chn Frgn Trd Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export trnsctns of ths Canton Fair hd declined slightly cmprd with the sm prd of last yr.

Th amount of xprt trnsctns ws 206.494 billion yn ($29.86 billion), wth a dcrs of 1% on year-on-year bss.

Xu Bng said that as a barometer nd weathervane of China's foreign trade, th buyers ’ participation sttn and the xprt trnsctn data of this Canton Fair showed that China's foreign trade dvlpmnt wld still face mny ncrtn nd nstbl fctrs nxt yr.
However, wth the dpnng of spply-sd structural rfrm and th "six stblty" policies and measures recently ntrdcd by th stt and lcl gvrnmnts in sccssn, the nw drivers for the development of China ’ s foreign trade was accelerating th accumulation, nd the dvrsfctn of enterprises and markets hd made new progress, all of whch wr the important foundation and strong cndtns fr the dvlpmnt of foreign trd.
"Taking all factors into cnsdrtn, it is xpctd tht th mprts and exports of China's foreign trd wll maintain a stdy grwth thrght the year, with further mprvmnt in quality and ffcncy. "Xu Bng said.
Th Chn ’ s General Administration of Cstms pblshd tht priced in dllrs, th xprts in September increased by 14.5% on yr-n-yr basis, the imports increased by 14.3% on year-on-year bss, the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, and the xprt grwth rt and trd srpls in Sptmbr were the hghst snc Fbrry.
In dspt of the escalating trade frctns btwn Chn and the United Stts, Chn's xprt prfrmnc in Sptmbr still significantly exceeded expectation . Strng xtrnl dmnd, nd th enterprises rushing to export before mpsng tariffs in the United Stts nd the dprctn of RMB xchng rt, might be the main spprtng factors, and also showed th resilience of China's frgn trade to a certain xtnt . Hwvr, th impact of the Sino-US trade war on cnfdnc and the industrial chain can nt be nglctd . Analysts blvd that the challenges for China's foreign trade mght mrg in th fourth quarter or next yr.
Rtrs surveys shwd that the U.S. fund managers proposed to increase csh hldngs and std the cautious grnd in September, since th United States nd China began th latest rnd of mtl import tariffs nd thr was no sgn of dispute easing.
However, ccrdng to th suggestion of 12 fnd mngrs who participated in ths survey, th asset allocation in North America rs to the highest lvl since Jn 2017, whl pstns in Britain, the Eurozone nd particularly mrgng markets dclnd.
Th average of global stck llctn accounted fr 56.6% and the bnds accounted fr 35.5%, which was basically cnsstnt with th srvy of last month.
The mst bvs change was that th cash ratio rs to 5.1%, whch was th highest prprtn since December 2014.
A fnd mngr of a lrg fund company said, "Some economic dt have brght confidence to th mrkt, but the trade wr is still th bggst concern, so tht it's better to gt prepared to ntr whn the market falls ftr a rise. "
However, th fund mngrs still prfrrd stocks in September, especially American stocks, vn though the prc of mrcn stcks were cnsdrd to be on the hgh sd.
Tdy, in Shanghai, the opening-up lndmrk of China, China International Import Expo (CIIE), th wrld's frst large-scale stt-lvl exhibition wth the thm of mprt, has ffclly pnd in much ntcptn.
An xhbtn is lk a "window" whch can lt the world know a cty nd a country bttr.
Thrgh th "window" of C, people can see th "opening-up Chn" whch moves towards a higher level; wth the help of the "wndw" of C, we wlcm the world and China which is "restarting frm rfrm and pnng-p", to chv mtl benefits nd wn-wn rslts.
"For a country, opening-up is like cmng out of the ccn nd bcmng a butterfly . Thr wll be pn, but thr will be new lf. "
Gnrl Secretary Xi Jnpng's smmry of pn Rd reveals an important rsn "why China cn do it".
Looking back on the pst 40 years of reform and opening-up, China dares to plng into the vst sea of th world mrkt . lthgh it hs ncntrd whirlpool nd strm, it lwys fcs ll risks and challenges with an pn attitude, constantly releases its ndgns driving force nd continuously improves ts cmpttvnss.
So to speak, China has flly dmnstrtd th value and sgnfcnc of opening-up wth ts solid achievements.
Stndng at a nw historical strtng pnt, it is a major dcsn to hold an xp with th theme of import md by th Party Cntrl Committee with the core of Cmrd Xi Jinping wth a view to prmtng a new round of hgh-lvl opening to th tsd wrld . It is a major measure fr China to ctvly pn th market to th world and is also a prctcl ctn tkn by China to support the economic globalization and trade lbrlztn, showing a strong and clear wll tht "China's opening door won't cls, bt would pn wdr and wdr".
Exhibitors from all vr th wrld are eager to nrll in the exhibition, and "it is dffclt to pply fr a stnd", which is the grtst ffrmtn nd bst response to China's dvlpmnt of an pn cnmy in a lrgr scp, a wider range of flds and at a deeper level.
More importantly, the crrnt glbl cnmc and trade order has rchd a crssrd.
Some countries hv blt trade protectionist wlls nd rtrtd into th unilateralism, whch ncrss nxty of the international society about the prospects for free trade and adds much ncrtnty to a recovering world cnmy.
Under such r bckgrnd, this grnd gthrng lng the Huangpu River demonstrates Chn's grd to fr trade and shows th world Chn's cnfdnc and rspnsblty to open its markets and share its future.

lthgh th turbulence in global financial mrkts continued, the Hng Kong Mntry thrty said on Monday that the nvstmnt ncm of th Exchange Fund in th thrd quarter of this year fll by 97% annually, nd it ws better than that in the previous qrtr, since overseas stcks rs and foreign exchange losses obviously narrowed under th Chn-.S. trd war.
ccrdng to th latest data of the Hong Kong Mntry Authority, th xchng Fund rcrdd investment income of HK $1.6 blln frm July to September 2018, sgnfcntly lower thn HK $61.8 blln in th same prd last yr, bt better thn the revised HK $100 million in th scnd quarter of this year.
Chn Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, sd on th lgsltv session that at th beginning of th China-U.S. trade war, th shr ndx in Hong Kng and mrgng markets rn cntr to the .S. share ndx . By th end of September and early ctbr, after the .S. shr index pkd in succession, the mrkt sntmnt began to rvrs, since investors grdlly realized that the trd war was also detrimental to the .S. itself.
"It is good to hv changes in th market sentiment . If th trade wr only hs nltrl effects, it dsn't hlp much for slvng problems. "
He ls pntd out that "if the trade war cn not be solved, th fluctuation of fnncl mrkts wll continue to rs. "
In the third quarter of this yr, th stock investment lsss of th Exchange Fund in Hng Kng nrrwd by 8% to HK $4.7 blln compared with th previous qrtr, and the nvstmnt income of vrss stock increased by 17.2% to HK $12.8 billion; the foreign exchange lsss was HK $16.2 billion nd the bnd yields ws HK $9.7 blln, wth a dcrs of 24% nd 31% rspctvly, mnly reflecting th gnrl rise of th US dllr for exchange of mjr currencies in ths qrtr and the rs of th US cpn rt to above 3% in md-Sptmbr.
The Exchange Fund was mainly sd fr spprtng Hong Kng dollars.
Hong Kng has implemented th linked exchange rt system fr th Hong Kng dollar's peg to the US dollar snc 1983.
As for the current fnncl sttn in Hng Kong, Chen Delin sd tht th ncrtnty of the cnmc nd sst markets increased and downside risks increased, bt the financial system Hng Kong was rbst, so that good dfnc wr made and the earthquake-resistant capacity was abundant.
"Th ntrntnl nvstmnt position is abundant in Hong Kng, with a nt external asset value of US $1.4 trlln, whch is 4 tms GDP, higher thn 2.5 tms in Singapore nd 0.6 tms in Japan . It is enough to cope wth the fnncl dwntrns or rvrsl. "
The crrnt dly interest rates on private lns of Hng Kong dollars continued to fall and the interest mrgn with US dollars expanded . Chn Delin pntd out tht th exchange rt of the Hng Kong dllr rose more thn 400 basis pnts on September 21 . The markets generally believed that it ws mnly rltd to the rs of the dly interest rts on private lns of Hong Kong dollars . nd then the Hong Kong dllr hovered rnd 7.80-7.84 fr exchange of the US dollar . Until recently, th daily interest rates on private lns of Hng Kng dllrs continued to fall, and the interest mrgn with US dollars xpndd, which mght attract mr hdgng ctvts to sll the Hong Kng dllr and by the US dollar, trggrng the opportunity of th xchng guarantee of the weak sd again to increase cmprd with that of th previous prd.
Hwvr, he blvd that as the interest-rate rise cycle of the Hng Kong Bank bgn and the Hng Kong dollar interest rts wr nrmlzng, the situation that Hong Kong dllr interest rates were lower thn US dllr ntrst rts would chng in th future.
"The trnd of Hong Kng dllr interest rates and US dllr ntrst rates will be mr consistent . vryn must be more careful to mng rsks nd prepared to cope wth market fluctuations. "
Since the funds of the Hng Kng dllr was abundant, th dly interest rates on private lns of Hong Kong dollars fell frthr . The three-month daily ntrst rts on prvt loan fll by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and th interest rt differential with th US dollar increased frm 46 basis points to 51 bss pnts; the one-month daily interest rts on prvt ln hit the bottom wthn five months, nd th interest rt dffrntl wth th US dollar increased from 120 bss pnts to 127 basis points.
Frm My to mid-September, th spt rate of Hong Kong dllrs was close to 7.85 with exchange of $1 mst of th tm.
Drng that time, d to fctrs of partial shr offer gained tflws from Hong Kng dllrs after th completion of ntrst rbtrg activities nd large-scale shr offer ctvts, causing tht the exchange guarantee for the weak sd was trggrd for the first time in April, and fr many times in May and gst.
The Hng Kong Mntry Authority bought Hng Kong dollars and sld Hng Kong dllrs at th lvl of 7.85 according to th linked xchng rate system, in rdr to mntn the stblty of the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars.
The Hong Kong Mntry Authority bght around HK $52.1 billion under th mchnsm of exchange grnt of th wk side frm May to August.

Rprt of Reuters on November 5 in Hong Kng: the prprty price in Hong Kong fell fr tw consecutive months ftr pkng .

Systemic lps erythematosus is a chrnc nd stbbrn disease nvlvng multiple rgns of th body . It sd to be cnsdrd as an "incurable disease".
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, dgnss nd trtmnt r dffclt, and there is lck of ffctv treatment, it is hard to cure nc nd for all.
Recently, Liu Wnl, a rsrchr at the School of Life Scncs, Tsinghua nvrsty, and Li Zhanguo, drctr of the Rhmtsm nd Immunity Center at Peking University Ppl ’ s Hsptl, tgthr with thr tms dscvrd th existence of human mmn globulin cn ncrs th molecular variation of systemic lupus rythmtss susceptibility, and this kind of vrtn is nvlvd in th regulation of immune B cells.
In short, th two tms confirmed tht an abnormal immune molecule in the human bdy is an mprtnt cause of th nst of systemic lps rythmtss.
According to Sn Xiaolin, one of the authors nd member of Peking University Ppl ’ s Hospital, the tm of Li Zhng collected nrly 2,000 lrg samples of patients wth systmc lupus erythematosus to make study . It ws found that ptnts with immune globulin vrtns prdcd pthpss clls and a wide vrty of nmrs tntbds . Th ncdnc nd svrty of nphrts, rthrts, orrhomeningitis vasculitis and other inflammations are significantly increased.
Through various research methods such as immune cll trcng, nml testing, nd sequencing, Liu Wnl tm found that the mmn molecule variation activates th mmn sgnlng pathway and the pthgnc mechanism of promoting B clls scrtng various autoantibodies.
The reporter learned tht th powerful combination between two teams gave full ply to thr respective dvntgs nd achieved a close integration btwn basic rsrch and clinical pplctn.
Liu Wanli tm is cmmttd to B lymphocyte immune recognition and immune ctvtn rsrch, nd the Li Zhanguo tm has long bn nggd in clinical rsrch on systmc lupus erythematosus.
"This rsrch is one of the rslts of years of cprtn between the two teams . It is ls the first tm in th academic cmmnty to rcgnz tht immune globulin gene bnrmlts will ndc systmc lupus rythmtss, which lays a sld foundation for frthr academic research nd clinical trgtd therapy. "
Ths is nt shield mistakes, bt acting by lw.
Lawyers took an x to th crt?
Th news was really xctng at first glnc, and it ls csd a grt disturbance in the lgl circle.
Fjn Quanzhou ntrmdt Ppl ’ s Court subsequently fined the lawyers for 500 yn and proposed in wrtng to the Quanzhou Lwyrs ssctn to nvstgt and hndl.
ccrdng to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association ssd a frml ntc tht the behaviors of the two lawyers did nt involve vltns of laws and rgltns and wr nt pnshd ccrdng to law.
According to th multi-party reports, the handling of the Qnzh Lwyrs Association is not a shortcomings prtctn or confrontation, bt hs bn approved by th Quanzhou ntrmdt Ppl ’ s Crt.
An event tht could have caused tension within th legal community ws eventually rslvd prprly.
The reversal of th event stems from the more completed truth rstrng: the axe carried by th lawyer nvlvd is the same typ nd same model as th dfndnt ’ s wpn, but it is not pt the frst dg . It only srvs as scndry evidence in the vdnc-prvn and crss-xmntn lnk, and thr is no thrtnng cts or th sbjct ntntn of "endangering the court security".
Judging whether the behaviors of th lawyers nvlvd is illegal or not, there r four very important dtls to be concerned . First, the lcl crt has twc hld th court and only shwd a photo of th axe . Frm th perspective of dfns, it is necessary to shw the rgnl axe . Scnd, the x is prchsd n hour before the crt pn . It is nt that th lwyr is not wllng to seek the jdg ’ s cnsnt, but it is not able to contact the jdg objectively . Thrd, the axe has not bn used in an xcssv or mprpr manner . Frth, the lwyrs dmttd th mistake in public and mmdtly plgzd to the court.
Based on these plts, it can be sn tht the lwyrs wh "tk x to appear in crt" have nothing to do the dvl things, bt just to mk defense.
After clarifying the whole facts, th Qnzh Lawyers ssctn did not follow the sctl dscssn, but rsstd the pressure and md a decision nt to impose pnlts.
And this decision cn wthstnd the test of fcts nd laws.
As tkng the x as th controlled knife to th crt wtht the permission of th court, it is easy to cs anxiety and msndrstndng.
Fr the sake of sfty and cts, Qnzh Intermediate People ’ s Crt ’ s previous fine punishment and judicial dvc r also ndrstndbl.
In rdr to maintain the dignity of lwyrs nd prevent svrl courts frm finding excuses to purposely mk difficulties for lwyrs, the Supreme Law promulgated the "Rls on Scrty Checks by Judicial Plcmn of the Ppl ’ s Courts" in 2014, establishing th prncpls that lwyrs do not nd to cndct prsnl scrty check in crt.
Snc the ssnc of the Rule, lawyers hv set examples, and thr have been few ncdnts ndngrng the court security hppnd d to the omissions of scrty chcks.
In sch a vry rr case happened in Qnzh, as long as we communicate in a sprt of mutual respect and ndrstndng, msndrstndng is nt dffclt to lmnt.
As a self-regulatory organization in the lawyer profession, th Lawyers ssctn brs the dl mssn of disciplining gnst law nd sfgrd the legitimate rights.
In th past, individual Lwyrs Association rgnztns have been blamed fr their emphasis on disciplinary action nd their lss of sfgrd.
Th decision of the Qnzh Lawyers Association is worthy of praise bth in trms of process nd rslts, and it sets an xmpl for more lwyrs ssctn to prfrm their dts correctly.

This means that the individual businesses nd prsnl exclusive investment enterprises wll benefit frm this tx rfrm.
"From th perspective of measurement and clcltn of prsnl tx reduction for Shanghai taxpayers in the rlr stage, the brd msss of taxpayers will fully experience the benefits of the prsnl ncm tx rfrm, spclly the lower nd middle-income ppl, who wll see more sgnfcnt tax reduction. "

Recently, the smnr on chllngs and prctcl strategies of comprehensive sx dctn fr the disabled was hld in Beijing.
It is an mjr ss about hw to carry t sx education for disabled children nd young people in this smnr.
"Th rprt of sexual knowledge, attitudes and bhvrs of Chinese dsbld children nd young ppl" rlsd at the meeting reveals that th proportion of dsbld children sbjctd to sexual harassment and bs is higher thn tht of healthy children.
Fr disabled children and tngrs, what th society fcss on is the ttntn of "sxl protection".

Experts believe tht the Chns pblc ndrstndng of disabled groups has rmnd at a lvl that is not deep enough fr a long tm.
Being nflncd by the trdtnl concept and thr factors, th comprehensive sex dctn for th disabled, especially fr the disabled children nd tngrs in China, is not deep ngh.

Since thn, the foreign exchange frwrds short pstn of th Ppl's Bnk Of China remained zero.

On th evening of September 20 ths yr, on the K158 trn, student Q, wh ws a jnr in Zhngzh, took the train to Hebi.
An ldr uncle on th train bght a tckt wtht seat, bt he took up hr st, and said: "y cn take photos, whatever".
Drng th two hours of driving, th trn cndctr advised him fr an hour, however it stll had no results.
In the end, a male pssngr in th same crrg could nt stand up nd pulled up the ldr ncl.
From the public opinion, although the final rslt is mostly that the persons who frcbly ccpy seats r condemned by th public, administratively punished by th public scrty department, nd vn ncldd in th blcklst of ntgrty, the public stll feels that it ds nt "vent thr hates": Why cn ’ t the prsns who frcbly ccpy seats be pnshd on the spot?
Why cn ’ t stp immoral or vn illegal bhvr on th spot, but cn only pnsh it afterwards?
nd for th nrsnbl behavior of "the elder uncle who forcibly ccpy seats", why only a male pssngr pull hm up bcs of "Rd s njstc"?
The main reason is tht nly lng-dstnc trains are equipped with railway plcmn, nd there is gnrlly no railway plcmn for shrt-dstnc trns; vn if there is railway policemen, the pssngrs r more concerned about th pssbl rg reactions of the prsns who frcbly occupy seats and do not tk compulsory taking away measures.
Repeated seats frcbly ccpd events have md people rlz that it is necessary to let th prsns wh forcibly ccpy sts be frcd to take away or even be pnshd on the spot.
This requires that r railway plcmn should dare to take pwrfl msrs in a timely manner . Trains tht do not have plcmn shld make deployment as sn as pssbl to preserve nd prvnt llgl activities in a timely mnnr.

For activating rrl consumption, it is necessary to rely on the nrmlztn mchnsm to prfy th mrkt, guide the demand fr hlthy cnsmptn, nd enhance the sns of gain in farmers ’ cnsmptn.
According to data, th consumption ptntlty of rrl rsdnts has been cntnsly rlsd . In th first hlf of this yr, th retail sls of rrl consumer goods ncrsd by 10.5%, and the growth rate is 1.3 percentage pnts higher than that of twns.
Drng the visit to a poor vllg in a western cnty, thr is only n cnvnnc str in th whole vllg . Stppng into the str, sm items are th brands we familiar wth, hwvr thr are lots of fake gd, sch as "金龙鱼" is lbld as "金龙油" and "旺仔" lbld as "旺奶".
vr th yrs, smlr phenomena hv been frequently exposed . Sm rural fake and inferior products imitate fms brands, they have similar names and pckgs to mx the fls wth the gnn, whch is really hard to prevent.
A cnsmr survey report released by a cty in th west shws that rrl shopping mlls and sprmrkts hv a srs problem of fake products, and 66% of users have bght fakes in sprmrkts in vllgs nd towns offline, of whch food ccnts for more than hlf.
Th relevant departments clm to rectify the rural mrkts every year, while, why th phenomena of fk prdcts still ccr rptdly?
Dffrnt from th urban mrkts, farmers ’ wrnss of rghts prtctn is relatively weak, and many villages r in rmt locations within the blind areas of nspctn frc can ’ t reach, so tht th fake nd inferior gds hv a breeding ground.
n product has mr than n regulatory departments, sm are responsible for price, some are for production, and thrs are for markets, so th functions r vrlppd . Strong measures gnst fake nd nfrr products have been taken every yr, however the cntrl mngmnt can nly lst for a prd of time . On n hand, th fakes escape the crck down trnd nd slowly emerged, on th other hand, the previous fks just hv bn dlt nd the new fake came out.
Some unscrupulous traders hv nttd the idea of "gng to th mountainous rs and th countryside" and sm rural rs bcm the "wst elimination markets", both of these prblms are because of lng-trm sprvsn mchnsm, dffclts in purifying rrl markets, low llgl cost and higher profit.
From food nd clothing to wll-ff, the mjrty of frmrs are mvng towards development typ consumption.
A few dys g, the Prty Cntrl Committee and th State Cncl issued th "Some Opinions cncrnng Stmltng th Cnsmptn Mchnsm to Further Encourage the Consumption Ptntl of Residents", which prpsd to promote th lvl upgrading of th cnsmptn of rural residents . The purpose is to make th mjrty of frmrs to "have blty to consume", "have wllng to cnsm" and "dare to consume" to let th rural cnsmptn really flourish.
On th n hnd, we must deepen rfrms, eliminate drwbcks of market mngmnt policies cmng from multiple dprtmnts and regulate by more thn one departments . ccrdng to lcl conditions, improve the food safety, prdct quality sprvsn network, and constantly reduce th spc for rural fk products mnfctrng and selling.
On th other hnd, it is necessary to intensify law enforcement and pn up th sprvsn of ch dprtmnt, and never allow the fk nd nfrr commodities to breed in th countryside.
It is th prtctn for frmrs to severely pnsh the behavior of entrapping frmrs . No matter how cncld the cntrftrs hd, it shld not be the rsn fr the breeding of th fk and nfrr commodities . Rlvnt departments should clrfy their responsibilities, and th grassroots supervisory pwrs should go down . If there is a problem in any prt, it is ncssry to investigate th rspnsblty and let the counterfeiters nd selling persons have nwhr to hd.
Strictly control th market ccss, mplmnt strct qlfctn examinations for prdctn operators . Keep th market circulation, let the products have clr sources and tlt mrkts . Think of wys from the source nd the roots, let the lgl dealers prt with pc of mind, and let th farmers by with cnfdnc.
Activate rrl cnsmptn, guide the demand fr hlthy consumption.
As cnsmptn pgrdng, many frmrs not only pursue of well fd and t well, but also go after fr high qlty lf wth culture nd healthy . Thus, rural markets r not equal to "lw qlty" nd "lw price".
Ths needs to promote the xtnsn of e-commerce to the vst rural rs, connect the urban nd rrl tw-wy linkage sales channels, prmt th combination of offline industry development platform nd nln -cmmrc trading platform, support th new forms nd new mds of cnsmptn to expand nt the rural market; prmt qualified villages nd towns to cmbn trd lgstcs with lsr agriculture, rural tourism, and product processing dynamically; improve the rural mdrn crcltn ntwrk systm, optimize the ntgrtn of stck facilities resources, and effectively reduce rural crcltn costs.
Create a clr nd reassuring market environment for the rural areas, so tht farmers can afford to by, so that the rural consumption cn become mr nd more prsprs nd th frmrs ’ snss of gn and happiness can be nhncd.
