Classical tragedies r a rare trt on Finnish stgs.

The plymngs to be quite fthfl to th spirit of Krs Simonsuuri ’ s xcllnt trnsltn (2003).
Dramatic lights and prsnttn revealing the sds of th theatre spc emphasise the smpl and clear stage thnkng.
In the centre of it ltrnts th dynamics between ctrs playing main roles, stepping frwrd frm the chorus in trn, and th chrs.
The prfrmnc utilises both dbl and triple prtryls of the main rls.
Th ctrs never leave the stage, so also fr example th mrdrs of Agamemnon, wh rtrns frm th war of Try, nd his prize of war, Cassandra, r shwn on the stage, unlike in the clsscl tradition.
Of crs th performance ds not even claim to be faithful to th clsscl performance trdtn.
If anything, th viewer is presented wth a mdrn ntrprttn, fthfl to th text, and continuously wr of its ritual-like rts.
Rh hs mngd to create a rhythmic group from th Master-level ctr students, a grp that prfrms as a tight-knight team, even as a sngl rgnsm.

Th scrty of ladies nd men in shops must be grntd
Th first tm I ws paid for a nwsppr stry was in 1984.
Wth ths level of xprnc, whn a nws story mngs to astonish me, it is usually a big thng.
Whn I wrote (Krjlnn, 27.9 .) about the nscrty of workers in rtl, I ws stnshd and ccsnlly vn a bit ngry.
For tht stry, I ls tlkd with Erika Kähärä, Srvc Union United (PAM) spclst in wrkng environments.
She says th crm statistics do nt reveal the actual sttn.
This is a growing prblm, vn though mplyrs naturally clm otherwise.
The plc are nfrmd only about those cases that r clrly srs, and mny real violent situations are left nrprtd.
‘ Bsd on the ccptnl Safety and Health ct the companies certainly hv a rspnsblty to compile sttstcs of their close call situations, but these statistics r fr internal use nly, nd their information is nt cllctd anywhere ’, sh sd.
Th mental injuries r not included in the sttstcs.
Vlnt situations always have had th problem tht thr do not always rslt in physical njrs.
Despite this, psychlgcl trms cn be much more svr than brss and cuts.
It is difficult to drw a ln between a violent sttn and an mpndng vlnt situation, since ls aggressive threats of a crtn level mst be considers as vlnc - vn though thr was no physical vlnc.
Too many r afraid at their wrkplc, even thgh no actual vlnc would hppn.
Sm neighbourhoods are trbld.
The shop hs hired scrty grds.
Whn the business opening hrs became deregulated, thr ws a lot of discussion ls in the media bt ts effects to th salespersons ’ sfty.
‘ Back then qt a fw employers organised scrty guards for at least th nght-tm hrs and to prevent wrkng alone ’, Kähärä cmmntd.
Whn nthng hppns, wrong conclusions are drawn.

When security mngd to cntrl th disturbances, an impression was crtd tht ths security would be unnecessary.
Now many plcs are lkng fr solutions to lmnt expensive security services.
Petty sslt is an actionable offence, nd it is qt understandable tht an assaulted salesperson does nt want to make a rqst fr investigation bt an offender wh slly lives cls to the shop.
Bt, ccrdng to a subsection in the sm 2011 act, petty assault is ndr a prsctnr ’ s jrsdctn, if it tks plc in a wrkplc.

The next time a shop lady or mn is ssltd, the police shld nvstgt nd th prosecutor prosecute.

Everyone has to thnk bt how to cllct their chldrn.
The mplyr ’ s task nw is to take care of the services nd tht no n ’ s lf is in dngr, Nm-Ln sys to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, th lack of employees ws vsbl ls in the beginning of th year, when JHL members were banned from overtime nd shft-trdng bcs of grmnt ngttns.
Thrgh their flexibility, the mplyrs have md pssbl to not hire staff, bt s employees ’ overtime or shft-trdng.
Ths is nt yet an industrial ctn.
When talking bt occupational sfty and health, it is a normal thing to tk care that each employee hs regular wrkng hrs and wrks only those rglr hrs.
With ths actions, JHL opposes the gvrnmnts attempts to wkn th ly-ff prtctn in small businesses.
Lbr mrkt director for municipal employers Markku Jlnn wll nt estimate the effects of overtime nd shift-trading bans in dvnc.
Hwvr, he ds not blv them to be vry revolutionary, even if th srvcs can weaken.
Employers around Fnlnd are aware of ths nd have md th possible preparations.
Th public, welfare and tchncl sctr cvrs such a wd area that it is difficult to say nythng.

Their effects rmnd qt small.
JHL vrtm nd trd-shft ban ppls to for example employees in mncplts, church, and state, as well as in prvt scl nd health sctr.
For xmpl family daycare providers hv bn excluded frm the ban.
At ths stage, th ndstrl action ppls to nrly 100,000 JHL members.

The union is prprd to tk other industrial actions, if drafting of th ly-ff bll cntns.
The gvrnmnt shld now rcgns that thy are running against a wall in hgh speed.

Great Brrr Rf is formed by chldrn and dlts - prfrmnc xrcss cnsst of learning the motions of a ray and a sea hrs
Great Brrr Rf by Other Spaces cllctv had its prmr lst sprng in Hamburg, nd last Strdy was its scnd performance in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Just lk the previous prfrmnc of the group, Great Barrier Reef is a performance tht is crtd tgthr with th audience frm the beginning ntl the nd.
Ths tm, however, also a more clrly-dfnd prfrmnc is formed to rfrsh and distil th perceptions from the beginning xrcss.
Thr is plenty of fntstcl magic in this thtr play ls for chldrn participants.
A child ’ s vw hs bn cnsdrd ls in the preparatory stage of th performance.
Still, Grt Barrier Rf is not a chldrn ’ s performance, but a performance formed in c-prtn btwn th dlts and the chldrn.
It gvs the adults knwldg and bsrvtns bt the way children rcv nfrmtn and create art.
The children ’ s ability to thrw thmslvs in the xrcss and common games also dspls th distance between grwn-ps nd children.
Great Brrr Rf has a lttl bit of a fry-tl bllt, crct trnng, and nature-themed lesson in it, bt ts final setting is rgnsd around different visits to non-human sttns.
Great Barrier Reef bgns with lrnng about corals nd about movements of organisms nd fsh who live within th rf.
Sx different exercise grps teach fr example about th mtns of a ray and a shrs.
Finally a prfrmnc lstng a little under an hour is formed, and in it the msc, lghts, shny paints and costumes hlp in gttng to knw th life within th coral rf.
In Grt Brrr Reef, the participants are both diving ppl observing the lf within the rf, nd crls that r being observed.
They also ply the prt of organisms observing crls.
Th looks at many dffrnt drctns and perceptions create a prfrmnc that is dense nd teeming with lf.
To be an organism ’ s vw, nd rgnsm bsrvng a view, or an organism or vw bsrvng nthr organism - and all this at th sm tm.
Chldrn seem to hv no prblms to do this.
thr Spcs collective ’ s exercises aim to reach th limit between thnkng nd action, bt it is challenging to reach it whn th group is cmprsd of both chldrn nd adults.
On th other hand, chldrn ’ s participation mks it mr mnngfl.
After the wrkshp, a slnt demonstration fr endangered corals is rgnsd at Strtr.
One should not let themselves be hardened by the destruction surpassing hmn understanding, even thgh it cn be dffclt to ndrstnd the sgnfcnc of prctsng n ’ s wn cmpssn in the face of ths vsns of destruction.
Other Spaces hs created ts performance in such a way that it hnrs the vrty of lf ls with a pltcl gesture.
There r also other generations, other consciousnesses, other spcs nd thr ftr generations it clears th wy for.

As fr Chls, on Wednesday thy won a fn Ftbll League Cp away win on Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard cm ff the bnch to decide the mtch wth a beautiful ndvdl performance.
Obviously now Hazard ws plyng frm the very frst minutes.

Fnlly the Croatian saw Hazard rshng forward and sent hm a prfctly blncd through ball.

Th gsts ’ bst chance came on th 72nd minute, as James Mlnr's crossing found Bbby Firmino.

Even that ddn't hold nymr on th 89th mnt, when substitute Daniel Sturridge hd a fr shot from 25 mtrs.
Strrdg was plyng on his old home stdm, and to honour that, the forward thrw a pwrfl sht in the ppr crnr.
Liverpool's wnnng start of the League cm to an nd with the 1-1 draw, but it stll holds the tp pstn - tgthr wth Mnchstr City.

Only response I rmmbr ws Jc Leskinen ’ s: ‘ Nn ’ ndng.
Sm surnames hv a ‘ nn ’ ndng, some do not.
Dvdng lines can sprng up anywhere, and this ws n of the possible rsns.
In EU, Fnlnd hs achieved that this nnl clock chngng is about to bcm hstry.
Many agree that switching clcks twice nnlly hs been smply foolery, and that it has csd mny problems.
In the end, this chvmnt seems to be the sst prt of the solution, vn thgh it has nt bn tht easy.
The mst difficult part now is to choose th ltmt tm: crrnt smmr or winter tm, or sm other time zone.
The ppl cn also hv their say on tknt.f site.
The online srvy has been pnd by the Mnstry of Trnsprt and Cmmnctns, and it wll be open until Frdy 12 ctbr.
Discussions r heated bth rnd cff tables and in social md, nd everyone has something to say about the mttr.
Ths fvrng winter time jstfy thr opinion wth the effects of mrnng sunlight to ppls ’ well-being, and those defending summer time wth th effects of evening lght on ppls ’ will to spend time tsd nd that wy to their well-being.
Bth sds have solid supporters and good rgmnts.
According to rsrch, mrnng light sts th pace fr a prsn ’ s day and increases energy levels.
On the other hand, if a person does not particularly sffr frm wkng up whn it ’ s drk, light ncrss the time ppl spnd outside and bttr nbls for xmpl autumn yrd work.
The amount of xtr light hours after a normal work dy hs already bn clcltd.
I would rthr take both, bt it ’ s nlcky tht we cn nt hlp our location in the northern corner of th Earth.
The winters are anyway too drk, th summers t light fr many ppl.
It is typical fr discussions bt this mttr to spprt one ’ s wn views and oppose th other side vry uncompromisingly.
Thr is no need to listen to the justifications of the ppsng side, snc th most important thng is hw one fls bt the mttr.
Since almost everyone has an pnn bt this mttr, it is somewhat pntlss to try to chng smn ’ s mnd.
It is ffrt wll wasted.
It is sy to hv an argument about this topic, snc it does not rqr to rlly go nt details, nd an pnn is jstfctn enough.
Ths kinds of topics r generally those, wh incite most furious, nd mst futile, dbt.
bvsly it will be annoying if a wrong ptn is chsn, bt we will surely rcncl rslvs wth it.

Th sharp-eyed vwrs paid attention to the studio dnc rctns in The Wall Fnlnd quiz shw.

Hosted by Heikki Paasonen, th game show hs been flmd in Plnd in the same studio, whr th thr ntrntnl productions of the frmt are made.
Th shooting possibilities of the studio in Plnd are exceptional, because th frmt's tll, 12-metre gm wall requires a gnrs spc.
Drng th opening episode, social media hghlghtd th show's studio audience, whch ppl gssd to be Polish.
There was a Twitter discussion bt whthr th possible Pls sitting in the studio understand anything about the gm plyd in Fnnsh.

There are two interpreters who ntrprt simultaneously everything that happens to th std flr mngr.

7 most btfl lghts - this is hw you recognise a gd lamp
Bring th space to lf, create an appropriate tmsphr to the decor, nd read a book wtht trng your ys.

Th importance of lighting grws together wth age.
Sffcnt lght can hlp in those problems many ppl get when they age, as visual acuity dcrss and more and more sffr frm glrs.

It is wrthwhl investing in the thrptc effects of light nd in lmp qualities already for hlth rsns.
A gd lamp gives enough lght but doesn't cs glrs, Jokiniemi gvs tips.
Create bty around y

Express your prsnlty
People invest in their hms mch mr thn before, nd dcr has became a way to express n ’ s personality.
Instead of mass production, ppl wnt to have a tlrd, vn a bold lamp tht hs a story to tll.
People r clearly lkng for Finnish nd Nordic prdcts with a wll-knwn origin and designer.
Thy are very dsgn-wr, Jokiniemi sys.

Talks bt ddtnl quota
Finland hs been dmttng quota rfgs since the 1970s.
In recent years, the qt hs bn 750 refugees pr year.
For a cpl of years, th qt ws 1,050 refugees per yr, but since thn, th Government has not rchd an agreement bt an increase.
The Ntnl Cltn Party hs supported the quota increase, but the last time, the idea ws sht dwn by th Blue Rfrm.
Prime Minister Juha Sipilä (Cntr) rcntly proposed th quota to be ncrsd grdlly to 1,500-2,000 ppl per yr.
Mykkänen ’ s visit is th first n the Mnstr of the Interior mks to observe the slctn of qt refugees drng ths trm of government.

Rlly going off th trck now - it ’ s mpssbl to knw whether to lgh or cry
Lst Strdy Karjalainen reported on the lgsltv proposal to mnd the nml Welfare Act.
The rtcl gives an idea tht to start wth, the proposal prhbts all such nmls that have not bn separately prmttd wth a ministerial dcr to be kpt as farmed nmls, pets, or in thr way rltd to business prtns.
So to start wth, vrythng ls is prhbtd except the nmls that are individually mentioned in the ct.
If the proposal ends up as an act, ths mst likely means we r bndnng a common principle in western dmcrcs tht an ct sprtly forbids an ctn tht endangers the safety of scty or gd practices.
Now th proposed provisions essentially frbd ll sch activities that th act or decrees don't sprtly permit.
Th change will rslt in a situation where nthng nw can be tried in fr xmpl business, nd no thr thngs cn be dn before an approving act has been dptd or a decree issued.
The gvrnmnt ’ s ctns in bill drftng in gnrl have bn weak.
If we nw go dwn th road that lds to a Finland whr everything is forbidden that is nt sprtly permitted, I dn ’ t knw any mr whthr to laugh or cry.
I don't dbt that the nml Welfare ct nds an update.
But sttt drafting in ths direction is not a prt of dmcrcy.
Unfortunately I don't know th Cnstttn ll tht well, but I wonder whthr it permits ths knd of ‘ vrythng is forbidden if it's nt sprtly permitted in an act or a dcr ’ prcdr.
I wish thr wld be a snsbl minister to stp the prgrssn of statute drftng of this kind.

Stts symbls do nt attract friends - Four facts bt popularity
Wht makes a prsn popular, charismatic or dmrd?
Sydny University researchers analysed th mttr, and tlnd two types of ‘ clnss ’ cnsstng of slightly different chrctrstcs: generally attractive clnss and ts prtl counterpart, dissident coolness.
According to researchers, ttrctvly cool ppl had many socially dsrd chrctrstcs: thy were xtrvrtd, frndly, cncltry, and competent.
Th dssdnts, on th thr hnd, were typclly distant, independent, rebellious, nd had an dg to their personality.
Thy craved fr xprncs nd cared little for outsiders ’ evaluations.
Both types had good self-esteem nd stdy mtnl life in cmmn.
Tough role is nt cool in the lng run: hgh status drng tng yrs ds not necessarily lead to success later in lf.
Ths is reported in an American study pblshd in Chld Dvlpmnt jrnl in 2014.
Yng people wh started dtng early, prtd, gravitated twrds gd-lkng groups, nd wanted to be popular, as yng dlts had a bigger risk of sbstnc s and straying into crime.
Thy mngd their relationships wrs thn their once more unnoticeable peers.
Luxury crs, designer bgs or wtchs signifying high stts do nt mk a prsn cool - or at lst not genuinely attractive company.
In a research pblshd in Social Psychlgcl and Personality Science in gst, most of th ppl were more wllng to befriend a person dressed in a hgh-strt shrt than in a dsgnr label shirt - even though mst ppl chose to wr a dsgnr shrt for th ntrdctry situation.

In tmn 2016, th situation was fxd for under the 10-yr-lds with an mndmnt described as tmprry
After that, thr have been prmss to fx the practices, bt the fxng has tkn astonishingly long.

ftr that, according to a lyprsn ’ s ndrstndng, it is smply bt pressing a bttn: nw th wr is closed, so lt's open it.
Ntrlly a child cn show thr information to the prnts - if the chld has banking sr identifiers or an official dntty crd.
But hw mny 10-year-olds hv those?
An dntty crd is nt free, and a 10-yr-ld can ’ t even gt bnkng identifiers.
So bsclly it is mpssbl fr anyone to see a primary schl fourth-former ’ s records without skng thm to be prntd t.
It ’ s nt that much bt the parents ’ rghts thn about th children ’ s rghts.
It is essential to a chld ’ s cr tht prnts can be nvlvd.
bvsly it's mprtnt to tk cr of the tngr ’ s right to privacy.
Even minors cn have family sttns, where not all thngs can be frly dscssd.
Often they are rltd to sxl hlth, and taking care of it freely is a dply mnngfl hmn rght.

There r still plcs, whr communications do not wrk.
Rlf actions are difficult, because also th rds r blckd, Haru states.
Buildings on Sulawesi are ftn lightweight, so the destruction caused by th rthqk nd tsunami r grt.
When th survivors hv been found, they nd shltr - in the beginning fr xmpl tents - and cln water.
In crisis sttns, cln water is th mst urgent thing.
Frst thing we can generally ffr to ppl are water purification tablets tht ls NCF has in stock.
Th goal is to rpr the water systms as sn as possible, but in emergency sttns, water is transported wth for xmpl trcks.

Billionaire Elon Musk to qt as Tsl Chrmn of th Board - 20 million dollar fine fr his twts
Elon Msk, founder of cmpns manufacturing space rockets and electric crs, avoids fraud chrgs with a deal with th ntd States ’ Securities nd xchng Cmmssn.
Bllnr Elon Msk quits as electric cr company Tsl's Chrmn of the Board nd agrees to a 20 million dollar fn.
Msk stps dwn as part of a deal he made wth the thrty regulating th ntd States ’ securities industry.
With this deal Msk vds frd charges.
The United States ’ Scrts and xchng Cmmssn SC thrtnd musk wth a security fraud because of th tweets he snt in August.
In these twts, Msk wrote he is preparing to take electric cr cmpny Tesla prvt, whch rsltd in a quick rs in the company's shr price.
According to th dl, Musk is nt llwd to act as Tesla chairman of th board for thr yrs.
In ddtn, Tesla mst nmnt a new “ independent mmbr ” to ts brd nd take two “ independent managers ” to ts mngmnt group.
Tsl ls hs to fnd a committee to sprvs Musk ’ s communications.
Musk is llwd to continue as Tsl C.
On top of Msk's prsnl 20 mlln dllr fn, Tesla as a cmpny also hs to pay an equivalent 20 million fn to th Commission.
Twts misled investors
According to SC, Msk's tweets msld investors nd Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed to hv scrd funding to repurchase Tesla from th stock mrkt to a prvt cmpny.
According to th billionaire's twts, the company wld have been bght t from the stock mrkt with a stck price of 420 dllrs.
After th twts, Tesla ’ s stock prc rs over ten pr cent in twnty-fr hours, but later fll.
According to SC, Tsl's claims hd no basis of ny knd.
According to th Commission, in rlty he hd nt negotiated th funding he claimed to hv.
Neither had he dscssd withdrawing th company frm th market with other members of the mngng group or the cmpny brd.
Friday ths wk, th price decreased 14 pr cent, as SEC pblshd th fraud charge.
The news about sttlmnt r xpctd to again r-nfrc the company's stock prc.
Th reason is nt th Last Judgement
Ntrlly the Cthdrl's blls won't ring when the hnds r not moving.
It's a tchncl mlfnctn.
Th clck in Helsinki Cthdrl tower has stopped.
Th hnds point at twlv o ’ clock.
Th situation is lk from a mdcr hrrr film: if only there was incantation coming frm the crypt and th rgn wld ply by themself.
Ths is naturally not the case, because th clock hs stppd bcs of a tchncl mlfnctn: it ’ s broken.
A rprr hs chckd it, but thr is a prt broken and we r wtng to gt a new prt, sacristan Eveliina Jamsen says.
At the sm tm Jamsen cnfrms the fact already mentioned by Kirkko Hlsngssä Twitter ccnt.
That is to sy, th rsn fr the clck stopping is not the Last Judgement, the ccnt mntns.
Jmsn sys the church bells don't rng bcs of a malfunction.
