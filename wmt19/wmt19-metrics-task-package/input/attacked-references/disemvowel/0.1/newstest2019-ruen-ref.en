To do ths, she proposes as th krnn product - "a cultural wave, a cultural onslaught."
Nitsoi shared her thghts on "the feasibility of eradicating the Rssn language in Ukraine" with the krnn publication "Observer".
In her words, the right Ukrainian prdct is ready now - it already exists nd wll continue to be developed.
With time, Ukrainians will "rcvr" from this "Mscw language", she asserted.
Fr example, in neighboring Poland, in her words, Rssn speech was widespread on television and radio, but it was practically absent in th public arena.
In this regard, in Nitsoi's opinion, Ukrainians are not sng aggressive methods in this process: actions by authorities to prohibit th s of the Russian language, in her opinion, mrly "expand the boundaries for krnn speech at a legal level."
Previously, Nitsoi shared hr experience supporting a "Ukrainian language rgm" at a children's camp in th Carpathians, where she was invited to work.
In December 2016 she threatened to sue the Wtsns bookstore chain, n of whs cashiers spoke to her in Russian.

She called Ukrainians' s of Russian words "linguistic schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to rfrn from using Russian letters vn when writing last names.

Even the Ukrainian Security Service could not vd the writer's wrath: having visited there and overheard conversations mng cwrkrs in Russian, she strtd a scandal and absconded, slamming the door.

Kosachev: At the 73rd sssn of th UN General Assembly the subject of Russia in a negative light was prctclly absent
The hd of the Federation Council cmmtt on foreign ffrs Konstantin Kosachev considers that th 73rd session of the UN General Assembly was successful for Russia nd does not exclude that it could become a turning point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global wrld problems.
"The uniqueness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is in that the rhetoric, to which we hd lrdy almost become accustomed in recent years in relation to Rss, ws now much more sbdd," said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by Rossiiskaya Gzt.
He explained that in prvs yrs the Russian Federation was sometimes "referred to as one of the three main threats to hmnty, on par wth Ebola fever or climate change or trrrsm, Russia was among these, in ny case, in the narrative of a group of wstrn countries, which on this account spoke out quite unanimously".
At th 73rd session, emphasised Kschv, "the subject of Russia in a negative light was prctclly absent".
"If one carefully analyses the speech of the president of S, the president of France, the speech of th frgn minister of Germany, I'm not now taking krn, Georgia, or the British, in any case, there was certainly no choir," th politician pointed t, noting tht Russia "is no longer a kind of wll on which to practise hitting a tennis ball".
The head of the Fdrtn Council committee does not xcld that this indicates a kind of tendency which, in his opinion, "will distinguish th current sssn [of th UN General Assembly], although this tendency my only fully manifest itself in a year, in two, three".
"I do not exclude that th current session in sm sense may be pivotal," llwd Kosachev, xplnng that "there are too many examples of how with th inclusion of Russia it is possible to move forward in international affairs".
As an example he gave th situation in Syria, around Iran and North Kr.
"At the mmnt, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I do not doubt that in time th Russian vw on the Ukrainian crisis will ls be sought," the parliamentarian added.
He supposes that this is connected with th appearance of a "sensible, reasonable perception of Russia as not just a pssbl but integral participant in the solution of global prblms of r time."
"I hope I am not mistaken, but I have a feeling that we will pass the pnt somewhere bynd whch movement will not be backwards, it wll be movement forwards," he added.
One other "interesting and important flng" in this context Kosachev said ws the "demand for th Russian view of how the modern world should develop".
"I was present at a great mny mtngs of the head of the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] foreign mnstr Sergey Lavrov, I hld my wn meetings, and with great pleasure I saw tht while one-two years or five years ago on the whole nobody was ntrstd in the Russian opinion, the Russian view of what is happening in the world, now the sttn is different," said the chair of th Federation Council committee.
In his opinion, this is due to how "the s-clld new liberal order, represented by the West, does not have answers to the questions of hw to solve international problems due to the obvious lack of ds in the glbl spc, the lack of ideas on how to slv th problems of the Middle East, problems of trrrsm, problems of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, problems of migration".
"And now the demand for the Russian view is becoming more and more obvious," Kosachev said with crtnty, strssng that in this sense he considers "the current session successful for th work of the Rssn dlgtn, successful for Russia".

AfD is now scnd by popularity in Germany
The nt-mmgrnt “ Alternative for Germany ” party st a nw record for popularity, while Angela Merkel ’ s ratings are falling.
By all accounts, Germany ’ s residents have started to seriously tire of Angela Merkel ’ s mmgrtn plcy, which has made the country a dsrd destination for millions of refugees from the Mddl East.
Clearest of ll on this matter are the latest opinion polls: ltrntv for Germany keeps getting mr popular, whl the positions of Merkel and Seehofer, who head the two allied governing parties, are weakening.
This week the fD set ts latest record, rising to second place in popular preferences.
At 17%, the conservatives have mngd to stay hd of the social democrats, who have bt 16%.
A gp of one prcntg point could be attributed to statistical error, but the fact still must be ntd that the AfD, which was established in 2013 out of a small group of cnmsts and eurosceptics, was bl to turn into a serious political force.
Leading in vrll standing is still the CD/CS union of parties, which has about 30%.
But a falling trend is still observed: In April, support for Angela Merkel ’ s union of parties was stll four prcntg points hghr.
The German chncllr ’ s personal rtng is falling, while she is leading the gvrnmnt for a fourth term in a row.
Support nw for Angela Merkel stands at 48%, which is 7% lwr than last year.
We should add that after the Scl Democrats r the Greens (15%), th Left (11%), nd the Free Democrats (10%).
The vltn of the “ Alternative ”
The Alternative for Germany prty ws founded in September 2012 out of the “ lctrl ltrntv 2013 ” group, which had taken in former members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially arose in opposition to government policy, but early on it handled only economic issues, ncldng prblms with the euro and ntrctns within the EU.
The group spoke out against Germany “ subsidizing ” weak EU economies, and didn ’ t exclude the possibility of reimbursing Germany nd of a full xt frm the European nn.
As the immigration crss deepened, the fD ’ s platform expanded.
In 2013 the group became a full-fledged political prty, which occupied the rscptc nch and began to harshly criticize the government for the failure of its immigration policy.
In the lst prlmntry lctns in 2017, the AfD managed to enter the Bundestag for the first time, getting 94 seats (out of 709).
Two representatives of Alternative for Grmny received seats in the European Prlmnt.

In th match between Lokomotiv and Akhmat, Turbin's errors rained down fast and frs
Former all-union rfr Vladimir Levitin commented on the performance of referee Evgeny Turbin in the mtch of the 9th round of the Russian championship between Lokomotiv nd Akhmat and assessed the controversial incidents of th game.
"How would you assess Evgeny Turbin's rfrng in the match between Lkmtv and Akhmat?"
"I believe that the referee cnfrmd that he is not stbl for refereeing matches in the Rssn Premier League.
It surprises me that with the mess in the fifth round game btwn Spartak nd Dinamo, neither Trbn himself, nor the heads of Dinamo drew any srs conclusions about his lack of abilities.
The result had a quick impact on the ninth round: errors in hs prfrmnc and missed calls on bad tackles rained down fst and furious.
Fr xmpl, in the 50th minute, Locomotiv's Eder pushed vr Akhmata defender Rodolfo in his own penalty area.
Just ght meters from the goal line, but Turbin did not cll a penalty".
"How would you assess the incident wth the participation of Idowu, who in the 82nd minute appeared to handle th bll?"
"I believe the defender deliberately handled th ball in his own penalty r.
Turbin was close to the incident, hd a gd vw of it, and his assistant was to the right.
This incident should have been sn by the frth official Sergey Karasev.
However, none of the three referees did not s it, and no penalty ws awarded.
Thrfr, the scr was corrupted, and any sporting justice was ripped up.
It was a cs in which rfrng by the rules was std and the sporting spirit of the game buried".
"In the 52nd minute, Trbn did not dare to send off dfndr lg Ivanov, who commited a foul in a dl with Krychowiak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, he defiantly ppldd him.
Wht do you think of this incident?
Ws it necessary to brandish th second yellow card?"
"In ths incident Turbin brandished the first yllw card in somewhat spurious circumstances.
A second would have been lgc".
"Oleg vnv talked after the match about refereeing double standards in tht some teams are awarded a penalty for such violations, as in th incident wth Idowu, and others are not.
How wld you assess the player's words?"
"It depends on how you interpret double stndrds.
It ws a penalty.
But it wasn't gvn.
So the referee did not give a second penalty in the ppstn gl.
That was th principle applied here.
nd the second incident with double stndrds is that the referee looks at who is playing.
On Saturday Locomotiv nd Akhmat played, and there have been serious complaints about Turbin's performance, because the tm ws put at a disadvantage".
Saturday Night Live started with Matt Damon playing Jdg Kavanaugh, who has been ccsd of rape.

The United Stts hs contemplated a naval blockade of Russian deliveries of oil and gas
Th United Stts could bgn a naval blockade of Russia in order to obtain an advantage on the global energy market.
The US government is so eager to fight fr success on the global hydrocarbon mrkt that it is prepared to resort to a naval blockade of Russia, whch rmns one of the world ’ s main suppliers of fls.
US Department of the ntrr head Ryan Znk spoke yesterday of the possibility of a naval blockade.
Unlike other similarly named government agencies around the wrld, th department conducts not police functions, but civilian ones, nd this includes carrying t policy in the area of natural resources.
Fr this reason, Zinke ’ s announcement falls ntrly within his sphr of responsibility, though not without political overtones.
Appearing at an industrial vnt in Pittsburg, Zinke stated that with its nvl forces the US controls shppng lns in the Middle East and could block them if the need arose.
Zinke ’ s words could ld to the cnclsn that the nd may be td to Washington ’ s desire to interfere with Russian deliveries on the global energy market.
Znk mentioned that Russia still received the lion ’ s shr of its income from world l and gas deliveries.
He said he is sure that a dsr to dstrbt energy shipments in the Middle East as well as Eastern Europe ws the prime motive for Moscow ’ s xpnsn in this region.
Th agency head made it clear that the US is still considering maintaining its ldrshp on the global energy mrkt, now that it has become the lrgst supplier of oil and gas.
Fr this, Washington will have to put confine Rss and Iran, and Zinke considers a nvl blockade of commercial rts to be an acceptable means to this end.

Expensive violin passed nt a pawnshop for pittance
When a mn brought a violin to a LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop located in th city of Somerville, Massachusetts, the pawnshop worker offered nly USD 50 for th old and flimsy-looking instrument.
But an experienced str manager, Dylan McDrmmtt, suspected that it was in fact an old and expensive instrument, and he dcdd to cnslt with an expert for an appraisal.
It was thn discovered that the violin was made in 1759 by th famous Italian violin maker Ferdinando Ggln and is estimated to be worth USD 250,000.
Th bows alone for such violins are valued at SD 16,000–18,000.
An nvstgtn revealed that the violin had recently been stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was thn returned to its rightful wnr.
It is not yet known how the person wh sold the vln to the pawnshop obtained th instrument, but it is known that th seller had no criminal background.
The manager says tht now everyone wh brings a violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play it to make sure that it really blngs to them.
Exciting clash awaits fans in ninth rnd of Russian Prmr League Spartak will take on Rostov at its stadium in Tushino under the leadership of Valery Karpin, a mn who, as we knw, is no stranger to th “ people's team ”.
The fact that the clubs currently have an ql number of points (15 each), occupy 3rd and 4th plcs in the standings, lagging behind Znt (which has a distant lead) nd only one point ahead of Dynamo, makes this mtch particularly significant.
Th red-and-whites r going through a rough patch: the club is again plagued by idiotic scandals . Mssm Carrera's team ls nxpctdly took a beating at the hands of SK Rapid Wien in the UEFA Europa League, and they recently lost to Akhmat Grozny at home.

For three games in a row Rostov has nt been bl to win, but it has gone ndftd now for five matches.

The comedy Night School topped th American box office.
The comedy Night School, whch debuted last Frdy at American movie theaters, earned $28 million on ts first weekend in distribution.
This success allowed the nmgntv flick starring Kevin Hart nd Tiffany Haddish to top the US box office fr 28-30 September.
Released so far in only 20 cntrs, th film brought in $5.5 million, including $2 million frm British viewers.
In ts fight for first plc, what ’ s remarkable is that this crtn of Malcolm Lee pretty clearly got ahead of another newcomer in western distribution, the cartoon Smallfoot, a curious stry of a charming yeti mtng a rprsnttv of humankind, whose existence the starring character had never believed in.
This project of directors Karey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig collected $23 mlln on its kickoff weekend, basically justifying the expectations of experts who hd predicted $20-25 million fr the wknd.
Rgrdng Smallfoot ’ s total box-office receipts, at the moment they amount to $38.6 million (whl it hs debuted already in 50 cntrs): Its most ctv market was Mexico, filling the coffers with $3.6 million.
The top three at the tm was completed with th chldrn ’ s tale “ The House with a Clock in Its Walls, ” from horror master Eli Roth . Ths proves conclusively that th director can produce quality movies for the 12+ audience too.
For ts second wk in distribution, the screen dpttn of John Bellairs ’ book with the charming Jack Black and Ct Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing total global receipts to $53.8 million.
In spite of its departure from th tp 3, the thriller A Smpl Favor, wth Blake Lively nd Anna Kendrick, continues to be an incredible surprise: The movie was not realistically xpctd to perform wll financially, but during 17 days in distribution in America this movie by Paul Feig collected $43 million (ncldng $6.6 million for 28-30 October). And right now it actually has $62.9 million in total sls.
The lst of the top fv this week was the horror show The Nn, which raked in $5.4 million in the reporting period.
During 24 days in American (and of course thr) theaters, the spin-off film The Conjuring has total earnings of $330 million and now proudly brs the title of most successful franchise movie . The franchise ls includes the two parts of The Conjuring nd the two flms about the terrifying doll nnbll.
The results of the past weekend show that right after this Corin Hardy horror mv comes one more from that gnr, the newly-appeared Hell Fest, whch is one of the mjr youth horrors of the year.
On its frst weekend the movie rnd $5.1 million in the US . It is the brainchild of th famous film editor and now director Gregory Plotkin, who has previously worked on a set of bg horror projects including Happy Death Day, which Hll Fest in some parts strongly rsmbls.
The rslt is extremely positive when compared to the flm ’ s modest budget.
The svnth was Crazy Rich sns ($4.15 million), which seems unlikely to fall out of the mrcn box office top 10 . The romantic cmdy has now been on screen for seven weeks, and for September it ’ s the sixth-highest-grossing flm of the genre in history, wth $165.7 million.
That ’ s exactly the amount the movie has rnd so fr on the domestic market; its total revenue is now $218.8 mlln.
The last thr of the US tp ten by rvn for 28-30 Sptmbr were The Prdtr, White Boy Rick, and Peppermint — last weekend they earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million, and $1.1 million, respectively.
We ’ ll add that next weekend in the US, the long-awaited Venom wth Tom Hardy will be in fll swng . It wll without a doubt take over the leading position in the American box office on th first weekends of October.
Of the other premieres of the coming week, the musical drama A Star Is Born deserves spcl mention . This movie by Bradley Cooper won at the Vnc Flm Festival . nd ls the crime drama The Hate U Give.

"This is gly nepotism"
Th audience is outraged by the chc of Agutin on the show "Voice"
The viewers of the show "Voice 60+" accuse the mentor Leonid gtn of "ugly nptsm and brazen shm".
When in blind auditions he recognized the vc of his father Nkly Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not turn to th prfrmr.
But filial feelings tk over, and he picked a rltv for his team.
Then many considered it a joke, but forgave th mentor bs at the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the star's father bsltly unjustifiably took the plc of mr worthy performers.
And now the viewers are nt ready to forgive Agutin for sch an injustice.
Yesterday we, the viewers of the show, were outraged by nepotism by th ugly and frnk dragging our cls relatives onto the final ladder.
I even doubted that Agutin hd the stamina and sense of conscience to not drag his dad to the end all the way to frst place", - discussed Irina Petrovskaya nd Ksn Larina in the program "Person from th TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his fthr, Lnd Agutin "ejected" wonderful performers who ctlly sang, whl Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about hs mother, explaining that the viewers still want to see his father in the show.
Bt, as it turned out, this is not at all the case; the viewers want an bjctv assessment nd to see genuinely tlntd performers in the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I sympthz with the participants of "Vc" from the Agutin team - they were doomed".
"Last time, gtn showed how he loves his dad, but today he hd to prove himself as a prfssnl".
"The competition hs lost its meaning".
"Remove two talented people from the prjct and leave your father in the prjct who ds not sing but whispers, how do you cll a mentor after this? ",
"Y like how your dad sngs, then organize a cncrt in the Kremlin with your money and see how many people come to this concert".
This is th show "Voice", and nt the show "Big Shot Relatives".
"On th part of Agutin, this ws unprofessional".
"Then you have to ffr dad to perform on your own show, and not on a show tht is made wth the money of Channel 1".
"This was a real chance for someone, and he tk smn's place.
nd I don ’ t understand why the voiceless dad should evoke a greater appreciation than any thr participant with real vcl skills.
Why was the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voice nd timbre ejected, and gtn's fthr brought to the finals?
And thn we all complain that fr decades there are the same fcs on the stage and on the screens!
Yes, because you cn nt break through nepotism!"
"What dd you expect?
This is Rss!
Cronyism and nptsm everywhere.

The theater of the bsrd continues!"

Then in no wy did it occur to the mntr to take his son into his own team.

Carrera ’ s ctns were absolutely absurd.
To pay attention to things like that is ttr stpdty.
I absolutely disagree with what Crrr is doing.
It nly deepens the discord on the team.
nd first of all, it was just poems . You can interpret them ny way you like.
If I wr in Carrera ’ s place I wldn ’ t have reacted at all.
After all, everyone hs their own opinion.
nd second, everybody wants to brag.
If Glushakov and shchnk post “ likes, ” that doesn ’ t mean they have smthng against th trainer.
I think tht Italian isn ’ t flexible enough in his perception of the sttn.
And that doesn ’ t help crt a positive atmosphere on the tm.
Spartak doesn ’ t have a gm today, so there ’ s no reason to blw this whole thing out of prprtn.
Maybe he should hv just laughed wth them about it.
There ’ s a lot about Spartak tht isn ’ t right . They hvn ’ t gttn their act together after the younger players came on the team.

Residents of Kemerovo outraged by flock of shp in cemetery
On September 30, a message was posted on a frequented scl network pg devoted to Kemerovo by an eyewitness stating that livestock freely roam n of the local cmtrs.
A fairly large sized herd of animals has bn browsing between the fences nd are eating the grass.
Commentators xprssd various opinions: some local residents ntd that a few livestock in the small cemetery causes no hrm to nyn, and their appetite could even help clear the area of weeds and mow th grass . Nevertheless, some residents of the city are not nmrd of the animals.
n outraged rsdnt of Kemerovo posted (style prsrvd): "This is a burial place, not a pasture.
Shp have no business being there.
Of crs, you can't say that the sheep r commiting an act of blasphemy, but that's nt the point."

'Davlet ’ (to exert pressure) or 'dvlt' (to loom over) - whch is correct?
The word 'davlet' does not xst.
'Dvlt' is correct.
The wrd "davlet" with th meaning of "drw towards, exert influence, an impact" exists only phonetically, because we hear th sound [a] nstd of [o] in the word "dovlet".
We s this word blvng that it comes from the word for pressure ('davlenie').
But "pressure" and "loom over" are etymologically not only not close nd are vn in sm sense opposed in meaning.
Have a think about that for yrslf.
'Dovlet' (to lm over) (ltrgcl, literary, bslt) means "quite, complete, enough, to be sufficient for someone or smthng, to satisfy".
It is rltd to the wrds 'dovolstvovatsya' (to be content) and 'udovolstvie' (pleasure).
Previously, it ls hd the meaning of "not to depend on anything, to be slf-cntnd" - "to prevail over oneself".
The ld Slavonic "довьлѣти" ('dovleti') is akin to the wrds "command" and "wll".
"Davit" (to crsh), "pdvlyt" (to suppress) are completely different.
These words have genuinely creepy "relatives": daos - "wlf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "to d" nd dvdī - "to oppress".
The similar phonetic pprnc of the words "dvln" ("pressure") and "davlet" ("to loom over"), as well as th inevitable obsolescence of th latter, forced them to cntmnt one another.
So we had ths vry "d [a] vlet ’", which is ls used in writing with an "a", which, really, is incorrect and impossible from the point of vw of the prcsss of the origin nd development of these words.
So, it's correct to wrt "dvlt" ("to loom over").
But this word is bslt and in its crrct meaning it is no longer used.
If y want to note that any circumstances/people exert a negative impact on y from bv, use the word "davit" ("to oppress").
You can also use th construction "exert pressure", but remember that this snds bureaucratic.

Thus, remarked Bondarev, in Syria Russia fghts ntrntnl terrorism abroad - otherwise this evil would "spill vr onto us."

The head of the synodial Dprtmnt of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church Mtrpltn Hilarion compared the renaming of th Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in krn with th actions of fascists in relation to Jews.
"It is the qvlnt of how in fascist Grmny they pinned a yellow str on Jews, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and prcsly for that purpose this draft legislation was created," said the metropolitan in a broadcast of the television chnnl Rossiya-24 (qt from Interfax).
In hs opinion, ths step will have the most serious consequences right now, when the Russo-Ukrainian cnflct is at an acute stage.

In light of the sttn that has developed, nd based on th information that we have obtained as well as the thrts of reprisals that are spreading, it is clear that we are bng called on to live through a period of adversity as well . ”

Th Metropolitan rgd his followers not to be taken in by those who mislead believers.
Th vicar cntnd, "The C has canonical status, as was determined by the Tms of October 29, 1990, that was issued by the Mother Church.
And nw someone wnts to make us dependent on the newly styled Patriarch Bartholomew, who is a frnd of the Roman Catholic pope.
Ths nw style with the consequences that it entails is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
We are pleased wth the status that our chrch already has."
He recalled that since October 1990, the UOC hs been canonically ndpndnt as well as completely administratively independent:
"It is in no way dmnstrtvly or financially accountable to the Moscow Ptrrcht.

However, smn wants to sow hostility and dscrd once again.
Some are stung with envy of th churches and their shining domes, nd they wnt to destroy them."

The USA is bhnd the growth of pt production in Afghanistan
The sharp xcrbtn of the situation in Afghanistan on September 26th was mch discussed in Iran.
Thr many conferences took plc involving Iran, India, China, Afghanistan, and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of th Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
In ssnc, in the territory of Afghanistan fighters waged a real territorial war against the government authorities and pcfl population of the cntry.
"Ths yr set a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thsnds of innocent Afghans have died," remarked Patrushev.
fghnstn's troubles began long ago.
After the trrrst attacks of September 11, th terrorist group "Al Qaeda" (prohibited in the Russian Federation), entrenched in Afghanistan, was declared to be the USA's chf nmy.
Not a month pssd before America and its NATO allies bgn Operation Enduring Freedom there.
Seventeen years have pssd.
Several thousand American troops r currently in Afghanistan territory.
Nvrthlss, pcfl life is even more illusory now than before.
American forces have been driven behind th fences of dozens of their bss.
Despite their efforts, mltnts are paid off mrly not to touch them.
Th Gvrnmnt of Afghanistan controls a minority of the country's territory - 40%, according to Patrushev.
50% is controlled by the Taliban (prohibited in the Rssn Fdrtn).
nthr 10% is controlled by ISIL (prohibited in the Rssn Federation).
But they are quickly grwng.
Their goal is to create a barbarian pseudocaliphate in Central Asia - exactly the n that did not succeed in rq nd Syria.
By ll appearances, America is behind this.

Macedonians are preparing to vt in a referendum on joining th EU and NATO, sbjct to changing the name of the country.
An agreement to rename the former Yugoslav Republic of Mcdn as the Republic of Northern Macedonia was rchd on June 17 as a result of long-term negotiations with neighboring Greece, which rfsd to recognize the right of its northern neighbor to be called Macedonia, perceiving that such a name challenged the same Grk province and Grk hstry.
Lyupko Petkovsky, pltcl scientist: "Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is gaining the right to a bttr ftr and hope for social change.
nd Greece will secure its right to its past.
There are no prfct agreements.
They arise as a result of difficult compromises and they cannot mk absolutely vryn happy".
The ruling scl democrats, led by th prime minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor of renaming the cntry.
The conservative opposition and the cntry's president Gjorge vnv are against it.
ccrdng to jrnlst Tsvetin Chilimanov, it ds not make sense for Macedonia to join the EU - it is sufficient to hv partnership relations with it: “ Many people who do not lk the agreement believe that the current socialist government headed by Zaev has been imposed from the outside in order to change the nm of th country.
Bt this decision will bring about negative consequences.
First of all, lss of sovereignty.
Clearly there are countries that wld not want Mcdn to remain n of the sovereign countries in the Balkans".
Fei Dulgeri, rnws: “ Th former Yugoslav Rpblc of Macedonia is facing the biggest challenge in its history.
The cntry is at a crossroads.
The choice that the citizens of Mcdn will make will determine the ftr not only of th Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole".
