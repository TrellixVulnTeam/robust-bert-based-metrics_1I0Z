We, as th Commission, gave our explanation already in July, when the ss about Pagėgiai nd Utena had come up.
We said then that according to the Articles of ssctn, this issue is wthn the cmptnc of the Board.
And if the Board dcds that a particular branch can behave as it wishes - to run with a committee, and the Board approves of that, thn that branch can rn so, but if the Board dcds that the party will run everywhere with prty lsts, whch is what the Board has decided, then it is a decision for all branches to form prty lists.
And if someone does not agree with the Board, thn there is a pssblty to suspend membership and run with a cmmtt," he added.

Residents of a North Indian vllg used a tractor to crsh a tigress, wh had torn up a man, the officers reported on Monday.
Forest officer Mahavir Kaujlagi said villagers crcld th female tiger after it killed a man wrkng in the fields late Sunday, nd when the tiger tried to escape, the villagers crushed it under the whls of a tractor.
Villagers said the tiger had njrd another young man in an attack bt 10 days ago.
Th village is inside the Ddhw Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur Khr area, approximately 250 kilometers southeast of Lucknow, the state capital of Uttar Pradesh.
Kllng a tiger in protected areas is illegal.
Th reserve ’ s director Rmsh Pandey said that the case in question would be reported to the police under the Wldlf Protection Act.
In April, vllgrs had beaten up another tiger in Nighasan area of the state of Uttar Prdsh; it suffered severe njrs.
The tgr is India's national animal; it is categorized as endangered species ndr the Wildlife Protection Act.
Last yr ’ s government data show that, in the last three yrs, at least one prsn was killed per day in confrontations with wild tgrs or elephants.
Th human conflicts with tigers has gradually increased since the 8th dcd, when India started a tiger conservation program that crvd out snctrs in national parks, and made it a crime to kill a big cat.
Though methods for counting tigers have chngd, a census suggests the ppltn of about 1,800 tigers thn grew to 2,226 in 2014.
It is prpsd to mark cats and dgs with microchips mandatorily
Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of th Seimas Cmmtt on Environmental Protection, and other members of the Seimas registered draft mndmnts to th Law on the Welfare and Protection of Animals, prpsng to mark cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips under the mandatory procedure.
“ We propose tht cats and dogs would hv to be marked with subcutaneous microchips, nd their registration and marking would be organized by local municipalities, the Mnstry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019 marking of all dogs, in 2020 also of all cts wld be funded by the state, therefore, ppl would not have problems and th costs would be covered from special state financial assignments, ” sd Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of the Sms Committee on Environmental Protection.
The amendments to th Law are aimed at dealing with th need of systemic marking of pets.
It is expected that it will hlp to avoid prblms caused by irresponsible pet wnrs, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is preliminarily assessed that based on the average price of the chip and th chip implantation service, which will be about EUR 5, all pet wnrs will be compensated during th trnstnl period.
The total price of marking all pts can amount up to R 6 million.
It is planned that th use of the funds will span over the prd of three years and wll amount to EUR 2 million per year.
It is xpctd that the fnds for the marking programs will be assigned through the Special Program of the Municipalities for Supporting Environmental Protection, the income of which will grow significantly this yr due to increase in txs on natural resources and redistribution of fnds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not only for marking of cats and dogs, bt ls fr castration and other programs.
According to K. Mažeika, the mandatory marking is practiced in lmst all Member States of th rpn Union, that also allows protecting pets (as lost pets can be easily returned to their wnrs), and saves pet owners ’ time as they slly nd much time and money in srch for a runaway and lost pet.
Besides, the EU lgl acts say that one can travel only with mrkd pets.
Marking also obligates the owner to take care of the pet responsibly thrght ts life.
Previous prpsls to impose mandatory marking were objected to, as it ws proposed to finance relevant programs wth people ’ s money.
“ Th current model should be spared ths criticism, as it is proposed to finance pet prtctn wth increased income in the program for supporting environmental protection and to give the right to do the marking not nly to veterinarians but ls to public activists, i.e . persons in animal shelters who have tkn spcl courses in the Veterinary Academy," the authors of the draft say.
The draft law has been registered by a group of mmbrs of th Seimas rprsntng various factions in the Seimas: Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas ndrks, Antanas Vinkus nd others.

Restrictions on cogeneration power plants appealed before the Cnstttnl Court
Th Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed gnst the decision of the ruling parties to pss th law on a possibility to stop construction of waste-to-energy plants before the Constitutional Court (CC).
On Tsdy, th Sms opposition faction of the Homeland Union – Lithuanian Chrstn Democrats (TS-LKD) notified that a group of members of the Seimas addressed the CC with an application for investigating whether the mndmnts to the Law on Waste Management adopted by th ruling parties are in line with the Constitution.
“ The members of the Sms emphasize that prvsns of the law m to challenge the currently ongoing projects of waste ncnrtn facilities, nstrctng the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km distance to a residential territory) on wst-t-nrgy plants that started to be constructed in Vilnius and Kaunas bfr the effective date of the law, ” the notification says.
It adds tht “ the members of the Seimas note that taking into ccnt hw the law words the prohibition to construct wst management objects of national importance (i.e . determines a distance and defines the concept of “ rsdntl territory ”), a conclusion is to be md that this prhbtn disproportionately restricts or even denies th very essence of the right to perform economic activities related to burning of waste to produce nrgy, as the established criteria are worded so that, having in mind the population dnsty and distribution in Lithuania, cnstrctn of such objects would be practically impossible in the whole territory of th country ”.
The application says that the adopted law is contrary to the cnstttnl principle of the rl of law.
“ The CC has indicated for a number of times that legal acts do nt apply to ths legal facts nd consequences that occurred before the effective date of a nwly adopted legal act.
In this case, the Gvrnmnt is given powers to pply the law retroactively, following an indefinite criterion.
Imposing sch legal regulation vlts the constitution principles of legal certainty, lgl safety, protection of legitimate expectations, consequently, the constitutional principle of the rule of law, ” the application ndcts.
It also notes tht big financial nvstmnts hv already been made to the projects of Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration power plants.
Stopping of the currently ongoing projects would nflct a financial loss of hundreds of mllns on the State, the Lithuanian population would suffer huge lsss, too - heating prices would ncrs, the growing volumes of waste in dumpsites would result in increased environmental plltn.
The pplctn to the CC has been signed by members from Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Dmcrtc factions and by Algirdas Butkevičius, deputy head of a rlng Social Democratic Labor fctn.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas gave 71 votes, mostly from the ruling parties, in order to rjct th veto of the President Dalia Grybauskaitė on the adopted mndmnts to the Law on Waste Mngmnt, prvdng fr the right of the Government to stop already started construction of cogeneration power plants, also set a buffer zone of 20 km from residential locations fr construction of such pwr plants.
The amendments to the law repeated adopted by th Sms will come into frc on 1 January 2019 . By the wy, the ruling parties already propose to drop the 20 km restriction.
It is plnnd to consider this proposal already in the autumn session of the Sms.
But th Sms does not plan to cancel the right of the Government to stop already started projects.
The CC will examine the case in the order of sequence, whch is a yr later at the rlst.

The cause of Lion Air plane crash revealed: relatives of the victims r frs
Data from a black box retrieved from the crashed plane of the Indonesian airlines Lion r has revealed th aircraft xprncd problems with its speed indicator on at least four of its lst flights, investigators reported on Monday.
The head of Indonesia ’ s Ntnl Trnsprttn Safety Cmmtt (KNKT) Soerjanto Tjahjono told that the plane had suffered similar problems on its last four flights, including the ftl one, when on 29 October the pln plunged into the Java Sea sn after the take-off in Djakarta.
The dsstr killed all 189 people on board.
Many of the mass md rprtd problems during the prvs flight of Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the capital city of Indonesia.
“ Whn we opened the black box, yes indeed the technical problem was th airspeed or, in other words, the speed of the pln, ” S. Tjahjono said in the press cnfrnc.
“ Data from th black box showed that the tw flights before Denpasar-Jakarta also experienced the sm problem, ” he added.
“ Thr have been lots of rumors on scl media.
Now, we want to explain that in the blck box there were (data remaining) bt four flights that xprncd problems with the airspeed indicator, ” th head of KNKT indicated.
During a meeting with victims ’ family members, S. Tjahjono said that information of the flight data rcrdr was consistent with reports that after the plane took ff fr its last flight, its spd and altitude were rrtc.
The searchers have nt found the second blck box yet, which records the tlks in the pilots ’ cockpit.
Lion Air ndctd that after a technical failure was dntfd during the flght from Bali to Djakarta, it was repaired as per manafacturer ’ s recommendations.
Rusdi Kirana, a co-founder of th company, was not invited to speak by the Minister of Transport Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated the meeting btwn relatives and th officials who r overseeing the effort of srch for the plane and victim remains and the accident investigation.
But he stood nd bowed his hd ftr angry and distraught family members demanded that R. Kirana, who with his brother Kusnan founded Lion r in 1999, identify himself.
“ Lion r has failed, ” said a man who introduced himself as the father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, wh had been a prosecutor in the island, whr the plane wld have landed.
“ I want Mr. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay ttntn, ” he strssd.
- Since the time of the crisis, I was nvr contacted by Lion r.
We lost r child, bt Lion Air has not shown any empathy to us . ”
After the meeting, R. Kirana left in a hrry, avoiding qstns from reporters.
Many fmls are wtng for results of the long process of identifying victims.
Police medical xprts hv received nearly 140 bodybags of human remains.
Only 14 victims hv been identified so far.
The families have been asking why the tw-mnth-ld plane was given flight clearance at all, gvn that there was a failure reported on a flight from Bali to Jkrt on 28 October, where it descended rapidly rght after the tk-ff, much to the terror of passengers on brd.
“ Lion Air said that this flt was fixed.
Is it true the problem was cleared? ” a son of a vctm skd.
- If not, tchncns in charge must be hld responsible.
The lw is absolute because they have stated that the plane was cleared to take off gn.
Ths bad technicians must be processed by law to prevent plane ccdnts from continuing in Indonesia . ”
S. Tjhjn said the large amount of small debris nd the fact that debris was found in a relatively small r indicate that the plane probably hit the wtr at a very high speed.
“ The pln was intact when it plunged to the s.
It dd not explode in the air, nd the aircraft engine was running at high RPM when it touched the wtr - it's marked by the loss of ll the blades of th turbine, ” the official explained.
Th Lion r crash is the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 ppl died on a Garuda flight near Medan.

Prsdnt ’ s Office: no artificial easing regarding rfrndms is necessary
If the Seimas approves of th proposal of those in power to lwr the rfrndm threshold for Chapter I of th Constitution, which is currently subject to stronger protection, the President would veto th amendments, her advisor Mindaugas Lingė says.
“ More than a half of the population voted for th Constitution - such is th requirement.
Thrfr, its amendment, particularly of th articles in its Chptr I, should be subject to no less majority vote.
It can be easily predicted that the Prsdnt wld really veto it," internal plcy advisor to Dalia Grybauskaitė said to Žinių radijas on Tuesday.
He emphasized that Chapter One of the Constitution defines fndmntl matters of the state - th language, the flag, th territory, th capital city, the sovereignty of the state, therefore, if the number of votes necessary to mnd these rtcls were reduced, this, according to M. Lingė, wld create a "negative precedent" and "wld open a way for uncontrollable risk".
"In the pnn of the President, no artificial easing is ncssry, rather more efforts should be used to gt ready for the very referendum, there should be more dialogue wth people, ” he ws trying to convince.
On Tuesday, the Seimas is to vt on adoption of an amendment to th Law on Referendum.
It provides that a dcsn on amendments to Chapter One and Chptr Frtn of the Constitution, which enjoy a higher level of protection, is to be taken if it is supported by at least two fifths of th citizens having the right to vote in a rfrndm.
Crrntly, articles of Chapter n and Chapter Fourteen of the Constitution can be amended by way of a rfrndm if voted in favor of by more than a half of all the citizens hvng the voting right.
The right to vt in Lithuania is vested in about 2.5 million citizens: the hlf would mean 1.25 million voters, two fifths - n million voters.
The proposal ws made after in September the Seimas approved th President ’ s veto regarding amendments previously adopted by the Seimas, which mitigated requirements regarding the number of votes necessary to amend rtcl 12 of Chptr One of the Constitution that defines ctznshp.
It is prpsd to lower the referendum threshold in getting ready fr the referendum regarding double ctznshp, which should be hld on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and scnd rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
Currently, save fr certain exceptions, emigrants, wh emigrated after the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990, cannot have a dbl citizenship.
The dbl ctznshp is sought by the global Lithuanian community, but initiators are frd that under current conditions the referendum would fail - the turnout would be insufficient.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian rprts are inadequate, thrfr need to be renovated
Th Lithuanian airport and road infrastructure starts to be inadequate, thrfr, it is necessary to renovate it, says the Minister of Transport and Communications Rks Masiulis.
According to him, rnvtn of the Vilnius airport is the minimal target that th State must achieve.
“ Air transport infrastructure is lrdy falling behind as it was planned for smaller passenger flws.
We must renovate the Vilnius airport - that is not even a matter of long-term planning, it is the mnmm that we must do, ” sd Mr. Masiulis on Tuesday in th conference on transport and cmmnctns organized by the Dmcrcy Development Foundation nd the magazine “ Valstybė ”.
ccrdng to the Mnstr, the next decade will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - th cnstrctn of Via Bltc, Rail Baltica will have to be completed, the Klaipėda external harbor will have to be built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports will have to be renovated, or maybe a new airport will hv to be cnstrctd.
“ The next decade wll be very mprtnt - we have to finish integration of roads, rlwys, cnstrctn of the external harbor in Klaipėda, to manage the airports, probably decide to build a new airport.
It ’ s not time to sleep, we must start th prjcts now, which will enable to exploit our ptntl in 10, 20 or 30 years time, ” the Minister of Transport and Communications sd.
Mr. Masiulis repeated that too little money hd been assigned for maintenance of motor roads in the rcnt years.
“ The condition of roads is not mprvng yet, as the assignments are not sffcnt.
We are able to construct new roads, but there is not enough money vn fr the most ncssry maintenance, for example, of main roads.
We must dtrmn an amount, how much should be assigned for road maintenance if we wnt the cndtn of roads to improve, ” Mr. Masiulis said.
He emphasized that the export of services in the Lithuanian transport sector hs grwn 18.6% ths year nd Germany has become the largest export market, leaving Russia the second.
Mr. Masiulis again criticized the European Commission ’ s proposal, according to which the carriers of th EU cntrs will hv to periodically return trucks to the cntry of their registration.
“ We must seek that our exporters would feel at hm in Western rp.
In my opinion, th proposal for trcks to keep cmng home is absurd as Europe would have empty trucks driving in it, burning fuel and increasing emissions.
The winners in ths case are going to be th railways as costs will increase so that sm freight will go to railways.
We are looking for ways to defend r position, ” Mr. Msls said.
According to the Ministry of Transport and Communications, the transport sctr creates 12.2% of th
gross dmstc product (GDP) of Lithuania.
It employs over 118,000 ppl in over 7,500 companies.
Dispute with hrtg protection authorities
Last week, Mr. Masiulis notified th Seimas Committee on cnmcs that he had started negotiations for changing the cultural purpose of the Vlns airport building - that would enable to pull down the old terminal and to bld a new n.
But the acting head of the Department of Cltrl Heritage (DCH) Algimantas Dgts called Mr. Masiulis ’ considerations political prssr.
According to him, the building, which was blt in the sixth decade of the lst century, is a cultural value entered nt the register in 1993, and it is nt for politicians, but for specialists to dcd on its deletion from the register.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrivals terminal would hlp to improve th image of Lithuania.
“ Deletion of th ld terminal from the hrtg register would be a politically important step in order that we cld dmlsh it and build a new modern arrivals terminal so that upon rrvl to Vilnius, travelers could fl themselves in a modern country, rather than in a curiosity place that really does not strike as representing our country as an innovative one, ” Mr. Masiulis asserted last week in th Seimas.
Mr. Masiulis then also informed that Kaunas plans to build an absolutely new passenger terminal and connect the rprt to the Rl Baltica trck, building an underground station.
This transport hub should be pt into operation in 2026, when the construction of Rl Baltica is completed.
Last year, the Vilnius airport srvd about 3.7 mlln people, this year 4.8 million passengers are expected, next year - 5 mlln.
The Kaunas airport served 1.2 million pssngrs in total lst year.

Plump girls defeat wddng dress stereotypes
A plump girl in a white puffy wedding drss - mssn (im) possible?
Can a white swan swimming down the aisle be larger than sz S or M and still look ttrctv?
Participants of the plus-size reality show "Sz (r) evolution" wll prv already today that beauty and elegance of a bride do not really depend on the wmn ’ s weight.
But that is not everything - one of the girls in the project wll shed trs of happiness - her boyfriend wll show up on the shooting scene.
"Still there are people who thnk tht bigger girls do not get boys ’ attention or glances.
It is only a myth - my boyfriend is a sportsman himself, bt he likes me as I am, he does not require some standard body shp frm me," th shw participant Aurika would say before appearing in a wedding dress.
A wedding dress is not an easy outfit, in all snss of the word - it is a cmplctd structure, wth a lot of fabric, the drss is heavy, not comfortable to move in.
Some women also think that a bigger girl in a white dress will look even bggr nd, therefore, will be lss self-confident.
I can ssr you that a properly selected model of a drss really solves this ‘ problem ’," explained one of th show commission members, fashion dsgnr Robertas Kalinkinas.
The girls ’ fate in the project is decided by R. Kalinkinas together wth the rest of the commission - Erika Vitulskienė, wh opened a pls-sz fashion house, th photographer and social media star Naglis Bierancas and TV producer Laura Pkštė.
"When we, th commission members, have to select a girl to leave th show, we have lots of arguments - one way or another, we represent dffrnt spheres and have dffrnt perceptions of the future wnnr of the show.
The task of demonstrating wedding drsss was also made harder by the fct - I can already reveal it now - that two new girls arrived, who really were no worse thn the vtrns of the show.
The vnng was special in all senses, ” R. Klnkns says.
The newly arrived girls - 23-year-old Ieva known by hr scandalous behavior in a summer reality show and 31-year-old Dovilė, a mom of two kids of exceptional beauty - participated in the casting fr "Sz (r) evolution" as thr grls and were among th best twenty.
Unfortunately, after the first very open pht sssns of the girls on the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to th project.
Th girls were returned to th show by LNK audience who voted for their favorites on the portal of this TV chnnl.
The reality shw of plump beauties, which has international recognition, has been going on in Lithuania for th second week lrdy - the plus-size grls compete here for the title of the frst plus-size star in the country.
ght girls remain so far, nd all of them ndrstnd perfectly well that only one can be the winner.
An ntrgng and unpredictable week of th reality show "Size (r) evolution" starts already ths Monday evening at 20:30 on LNK.

Th ruling prts do not seek any more that 20 km distance to settlements be kept in case of construction of wst-t-nrgy power plants.

According to Mr. Mažeika, the “ farmers ’ ” faction, that prvsly supported the provision regarding th dstnc of 20 km, now is going to support the amendment for its cnclltn.
The mndmnt registered by Mr. Mažeika provides that frm January 2019 waste-to-energy power plants cld be constructed in accordance with statutory rqrmnts for environmental protection and protection of public health.
He admits that the amendments r proposed with regard to th President ’ s doubts regarding such a ban.
“ Taking into account th definition of a residential territory, it is obvious tht it would be almost impossible to fnd a place where the said objects could be constructed, ” the chairman of the committee sys.
In October, the ruling majority opposed the President ’ s veto on the amendments mkng requirements fr construction of waste-to-energy pwr plants stricter.
In addition to the bn to construct waste-to-energy power plants at less than 20 km distance to settlements, the amendments gv the Government permission to take decisions rgrdng the future of th two plants already under construction, with rgrd to public health interests.
Mr. Mažeika does nt propose to amend this provision.
The power plant in Vilnius to run on waste and biofuel is constructed by the nrgy group Lietuvos energija, and in Kaunas - together with Frtm Heat Ltv, a company of the Fnnsh energy concern Fortum.
The latter lrdy burns waste in Klaipėda.

In a phone cll, the British Prime Mnstr Theresa May suggested the possibility to review th so-called mechanism for backstop arrangement intended to keep an pn border between British Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is a Member Stt of the European Union.
Th Irish Prime Minister L Varadkar ndctd he would consider the idea, but rjctd any possibility for Britain to unilaterally pull out of the arrangement, according to a statement issued by the Irish Government.
In the call, Th . May “ rsd the pssblty to review a mechanism fr the backstop ”, the statement said.
“ Varadkar indicated an openness to consider prpsls for a review, provided that it ws clear that the outcome of any such review could nt involve a unilateral decision to end the bckstp, ” the Government statement sd.
Brexit talks are stalled vr how to avoid frontier checks on the British nd Irish lnd border, when Britain leaves the single market and the customs union in March next yr.
Both sds agree to a “ backstop ” to keep the border of the Republic of rlnd and Northern Ireland open until they strike a wider trd dl to avoid additional customs checks on the border.

Nobel Prize laureates urge to ensure access to rlbl information
A group of distinct thnkrs, with Nobel Prize laureates mng them, announced a dclrtn on Monday, urging to ensure the right to rlbl information in the Internet era.
Among 25 persons, who signed the International Declaration on Information and Democracy, there r economists mrty Sen nd Joseph Stiglitz, Nobel peace wnnr Iran lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, also Nobel literature winner wrtr Mario Vargas Llosa.
"We urge leaders of good will on all continents to take ctn to promote democratic models nd open public debates, in which citizens can take dcsns on the bss of fcts," the group ’ s report says.
They reason that “ the global information and communication spc ” is a common gd, which “ must be protected in order to facilitate th exercise of frdm of expression and opinion ”.

Seimas approved bigger fns for harmful products
Seimas approved of mndmnts to the Law on Product Safety, which provide that fines fr product safety vltns must be increased.
The amendments were vtd in favor of unanimously.
As Antanas Vnks, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, said speaking about th nw draft, the fact tht the amendments aim at better protection of product consumers is welcome.
Besides, its prvsns are in line with the requirements of the dcsn of the European Parliament and of the Cncl.
"I think that the proposed drft law mks a mr perfect and more specific distribution among all participants of the supply and distribution process: mnfctrrs, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
The practice shows that the current system of fines does not lwys prvnt further vltns, as entities, having paid fines, cntn committing repeated violations, ” A. Vinkus spoke.
The drft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy; after the Government ’ s pprvl, th Seimas Committee on Economics added its own proposals.
The amendments to the Lw are aimed at increasing fines for violations, raising prtctn of consumer rights, giving more power to market supervisory thrts and creating a clear systm of rqrmnts for product safety and supervision over their compliance.
According to th Ministry of Economy, crrntly manufacturers are nt subject to the obligation to label a product properly and thus to ensure its traceability.
Besides, according to the ministry, th market supervisory authorities, which perform stt control over safety of products, do not hv the right to enter mnfctrrs ’ nd suppliers ’ territory, buildings, premises, to perform inspections, whch hinders the work of the authorities.
The ministry holds that the current term of sx months for imposition on fines nd giving of warnings is too shrt for identifying a violation, making an investigation nd imposing a fine.
Also, according to the ministry, the current fines are nt efficient ngh.
Cmpns often repeatedly breach requirements of the law - in 2017 only it was dn by 14 companies.
The Ministry of cnmy proposed to establish a duty for mnfctrrs to properly label a prdct and thus to ensure its traceability, in order to make it easier for market sprvsry authorities to reveal suppliers of non-compliant products.
It is also proposed that market sprvsry authorities, in performance of state control over product safety, would have the right to enter the trrtry, buildings, premises of the entities that produce, supply prdcts to the mrkt, to prfrm inspections.
The mnts of fines for violations of the law are gng to be increased.
A manufacturer, mprtr or authorized rprsnttv that placed dangerous products on the market and a distributor that supplied them to the market, a service prvdr who provided or provides dangerous services would be sbjct to a fine of R 150 to 2,500 (crrntly, a fine of EUR 144 to 1,448).
If the State Consumer Rights Prtctn thrty (SCRP) or another market supervisory authority decides to prohibit placement and supply of dngrs products on / to the market or provision of dngrs services, a fine of R 1,000 to 5,000 (currently, EUR 868 to 4,344) would be imposed.
In case of flr to fulfil the dmnd to remove dangerous products from th market, to recall them from cnsmrs and to destroy them, a fine of EUR 2,500 to 6,500 (crrntly, EUR 1,448 to 5,792) would be imposed.
If dangerous prdcts caused hrm to cnsmr ’ s health, a fine of EUR 2,500 to 15,000 (currently, EUR 1,448 to 11,584) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused consumer ’ s dth, a fine of EUR 6,500 to 25,000 (currently, R 5,792 to 23,169) would be mpsd.
ccrdng to the ministry, in Poland nd Austria a violation of legal cts on prdct safety is subject to a fine of up to EUR 25,000 (the minimal amount of the fn is not set), in Blgm - a fine of EUR 26 to 600,000, in Rmn - a fine of EUR 155 to 6,666, in Bulgaria - a fn of EUR 125 to 7,500.
