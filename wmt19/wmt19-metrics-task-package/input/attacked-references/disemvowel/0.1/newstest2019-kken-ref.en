Gorgeous celebration in all the cities and residential rs of Kazakhstan of the 100th nnvrsry of bldthrsty rd butchers of Leninist Komsomol is a shame for our country, brothers.
This, first of all, means Komsomols' slp in the face of th Independence of th Kazakh Country.
Ystrdy the information about the great clbrtn of th 100th anniversary of red btchrs tryng their best by the initiators, heads of former Komsomol, followers initiated by today's red btchrs Nurlan Omarov in Semey, the birthplace of "Alashorda" standing at the origins of Kazakh statehood was released.
I was surprised to s pioneers wearing a rd tie on the Internet in Kazakhstan schools.
Nw having seen these Rssfd, i.e . slaves wth no origin started to poison openly the conscious of Kazakh young gnrtn I found nothing to say...What a horror!
How cn we ndrstnd this Komsomol's backtrack from the Independence of Kazakh Country, syng we are Russian slaves?
Oh, hrrr, slave's name is a slv!
We need to understand that recognition by those Tasmagambetov, Aitimova, Sultanov in fact tht they r colonizers' slaves, open expression of thr endless love towards Russia is an open recognition of the dependence of today's followers of yesterday rd butchers first of ll to Russia whch we thought to be vnshd into thin air up to date.
In 1986, I still remember dshnst actions of those crrnt "forever deputies": K.Sultanov, B.Aitimova during famous December vnts in 1986 dished on D.Konayev who helped them raise in their crrs to Gennady Kolbin, grieving and crying, now they told bt those participating in Dcmbr events: "Comrade Klbn, I wll brng those bitches you to punish them", and I was the one to write about this grief in my epos "Zobalan" (Outrages), drng the Soviet mpr, in particular, in 1990, made one-hour long radio ply in Munich, and I am the author of th famous writing traveling the world, akyn Zhumash Kokbori!
The Kzkh ntn also did not forget who involuntarily quietened down at that time!
As the citizen of Independent Kzkhstn, as the chld of the Kazakh nation, I will accuse openly the followers of those rd butchers!
If our country is ndpndnt indeed, I will openly talk that the day born to punish them as the state betrayers constituting a threat pnly to the Independence of Kzkhstn of forever president of this cntry as the whl people!
"My ntn, my Kazakh, my poor ppl" (by), it is the moment to openly punish these red butcher Komsomol as th whole nation.
Wake up, Kazakhs, history will nvr frgv your next quiescency.
Never forget this, Kzkhs!
