ttcks against abortion rights now in th United States - a strong documentary tells us why
The US Senate is currently attempting to investigate, whether Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's nominee for n of the nine members of the Supreme Crt cn be chsn for the job.
Many in th Republican party hope that with Kavanaugh's decisive vote, so-called Roe v. Wd decision that md abortion legal in th USA in 1973 could be reversed.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg's Reversing Roe dcmntry illustrates how the current situation has developed over th years.
As nblvbl as it fls, the topic is timely also in Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (Blue Reform) has conducted pr wrk gnst safe abortion, and received different levels of support frm the grtr part of our country's Members of Parliament.
In the beginning of this strong dcmntry, we meet gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who is nw, because of the law restrictions, the only Mssr stt doctor providing abortions.
An armed guard at the clinic sys he is defending th freedom of religion in the United States.
The news vds remind us about lethal terrorist attacks gnst the clinics.
Let us move to the time abortion was illegal in th United Stts.
At that tm, an vnglcl clergymen alliance directed women to reliable abortion doctors.
The reasoning of the ntrvwd pastor is sound, but ctlly not rlly needed, a picture of a woman died of a self-made abortion is enough.
Thr were about 5,000 deaths a year in th United States.
The legalisation of abortions was defended especially by the Rpblcn prty.
Already in 1967, California Governor Ronald Reagan signed th abortion rights ct.
Later it was precisely Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign who, in a revolutionary manner, bgn to mix rlgn with politics in rdr to draw voters.
Another to go bck on hs stance on abortion was Reagan's follower - George Bush senior.
And the same was done also by Donald Trmp.
The documentary reaches the vry core of the matter when it lks for the founding reason for th politicisation of abortion.
When rlgs organisation supporting racial sgrgtn were refused tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen as thr rallying cry.
Religion has brght exceptional knots to politics.
While writing ths, the situation in the United States is such that a president, who bragged about his sexual harassment but managed to wn the vts of the religious Right with his stand on abortion, announced Kavanaugh as a nominee to th Supreme Court, who is nw charged of sexual harassment by many wmn.
Kavanaugh may hold the balance of power to decide about th rghts of 164 million American women and girls.

Nrly 200 Palestinians hv been killed in six months, as Israel has frd at the protesters in the border.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza brdr on Friday, Mnstry of health of the Palestinian National Authority sys.
Ministry of health of the Palestinian National Authority sys the dd include two children: 12-year-old and 14-year-old boys.
According to the ministry, 505 ppl hv been wounded.
89 of these were wndd by bullets.
Israel Defense Frcs have confirmed they opened fire and md an air strike to the border, whn the protesters threw rocks and explosives at Israeli forces.
The forces sy they resorted to force in rdr to keep the protesters from breaking th boundary fence or attempting to cross to the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gz protests snc March, when Palestinians began weekly protests at the brdr.
According to the UN High Commissioner for Hmn Rghts, there are 12,000 wounded.
The protesters demand entry for the Palestinian families to th areas the Plstnns had to vacate when Israeli state ws founded in 1948.
A Plstnn sniper has killed one Israeli soldier.

Tm Pukki gained a penalty kick - ddn't get to shoot it himself
Wigan's central dfndr Chey Dunkley seemed to tackle him from behind nsd penalty area.
Referee Gavin Ward let the game cntn.
According to his interpretation, the tackle was cln.
Teemu Pkk could not believe his eyes.
The incident probably ws on rfr Ward's mind, as he judged a penalty kick to Norwich on the 85th mnt when Pukki was knocked down.
Wrd showed the penalty spot, nd Mario Vrancic scored the winning 1-0 goal.
Pukki has scrd fv times for Norwich in the Premier League.
The previous one ws finished stylishly using his pctrls against QPR on last Saturday.
Pukki hs a taste for working again.
After he lst the bll, he carried on with the situation until its end.
He crtd scoring spots and was tireless in the dfnc.
Ths was Norwich's fifth match in two weeks.
The team continues in the Football Lg Cup.
They hv a five-win streak behind them.
Paedophile help service immediately filled up with reservations - in Finland about 40,000 r attracted to chldrn
It is estimated that about two per cnt of men nd a small prt of women are at least somewhat attracted to pre-teens.
In Fnlnd this means about 40,000 people.
Those sexually attracted to children or young people have up to the prsnt had a difficult time fndng help.
The Finnish Foundation for Supporting Ex-offenders and Sexpo foundation hv a cmmn SeriE project that educates professionals in meeting paedophiles as clients and hlps people who are sxlly attracted to children.
When th project was published in the spring, it csd a real stream of emails to Sexpo, who offer counselling and thrpy, and all the appointments were quickly rsrvd, Yle says.
It is promised, however, that appointments wll become available during the tmn.
Sexual attraction towards chldrn causes shame to many.
Most of the ppl who have ntcd paedophiliac feelings in thmslvs have not acted out their fantasies, thus committing no criminal acts.
However, the ttrctn is usually a permanent trait.
Most of these people hope to be rid of th thoughts that cause distress and depress thm.
They also make normal life more difficult, sexual therapist Ptrc Thslff, who wrks as an expert in the project, says to Yle.
I think the work is valuable, if even n child can be saved frm sexual violence, Thesleff sys.
Leaders of Koreas or a gynclgst from Kongo?
The Prsdnt of th United Stts Donald Trmp winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - the thought may sound weird at first, but, according to the odds, Trump is one of the biggest fvrts to receive the prize.
This is due to Trump ’ s role in making North Korea cmmt tslf to d-nclrstn - at least in words.
Based on the odds, the biggest fvrts for Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean president Mn Jae-in and North korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met this year already three times nd promised to try to chv peace treaty between the two cntrs.
The thw in relations between th Koreas is remarkable, because as recently as last year the relations were frsty.
Even so, wrdng a prize to Kim, wh has fr years threatened with nuclear weapons and wh leads his country with an iron grip, would undoubtedly cause criticism.
The Nbl laureates r revealed starting Monday, and on Friday is the turn of the prz that attracts the most attention: the Peace Prize.
If th Price is not awarded to participants of diplomacy on Korean peninsula, one of the top nmns is a Congolese dctr Denis Mukwage.
In his hospital in the Democratic Rpblc of the Kongo, the esteemed gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who were vctms of gang rapes, nd he has bcm the world's leading expert on his field.
With hs work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a trryfyng by-prdct of many conflicts.
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which wn th Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 nd 1981, has also bn considered to be a strong candidate.
Nobel Cmmtt has revealed that this year there are 331 nominees for the Prz.
The names of the nmns are not made public.
Trump himself would not mind receiving a Nbl.
In My a reported asked him in White House, whether he feels he deserves a peace prz.
Everyone thinks so, but I would nvr sy it, Trump smiled.
I want to get it fnshd.
The prize I want is victory for the wrld, the president continued referring to Nrth Korea negotiations.
There r facts, hwvr, that make Trump's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee who decide on the award, hs ftn awarded the prize to people nd organisations tht represent liberal democracy and multipolar world order - exactly such international co-operation Trump has has been seen opposed to.
In th 21st cntry three US politicians have received the Prize, all of thm democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore in 2007, nd Barack Obama in 2009.
wrdng Trump would mean a complete dlgcl reversal for the Nobel Committee.
A fire alarm in a tunnel: Motorists ctd like behaved like lemmings, driving in the wrng direction
A traffic chaos on national road 1 at Lohja took plc on 8 Sptmbr.
The tunnel area traffic ws halted because of the announcement to both Turku nd Helsinki directions.
When the reason was discovered to be a systm error, fire service attempted to nrmls the traffic.
That dd not happen very fast, though.
We attempted to open the road once before, bt Traffic Management Finland said it cannot be done, bcs there are mtrsts spread t on the road, driving any which way, fr officer on duty Pasi Kääriäinen told to STT back then.
People were even driving the motorway in the wrong drctn, after nly a moment of waiting.
When the first one cts contrary to traffic regulations, a few other ftn follow, Contact Manager for Fnnsh Road Safety Control, Tapio Heiskanen wonders.
According to traffic regulations, stppng on a motorway or in tunnels is allowed only fr a compelling reason.
Finnish Road Safety Control notes that n cannot dngr the traffic in exceptional situations with rash decisions.
Emergency vehicles must lwys be given as unimpeded an ccss as possible.
It is prtclrly frbddn to drive in an opposite direction on a motorway, just lk making a U-turn or reversing.
The same prohibition stands also in tnnls, where n must additionally always turn on the headlights.
In addition, stppng wtht a compelling reason is forbidden, as is naturally parking.
Some time ago there were even cases where the driver stopped in a tnnl to brsh snw from his car.
It should be obvious tht is a wrong time nd place for such activity, Heiskanen says in a Fnnsh Road Safety Control announcement.
lvs supporters would hv wanted to continue their party even whn the ship got stuck to the bottom of a lake
Ilves fns carried by lake ship M/S Tampere would have wanted to sty aboard and continue their vctry celebration, vn when th ship ’ s bow was stuck to the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the captain of th ship at the time of the event.
M/S Tampere, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tmpr, drifted away from ts route late Saturday evening, and its bow got stuck to the bottom of th lk in Akaa's Vanajavesi.
19 pssngrs and five crew members aboard were evacuated to the mainland during the nght.
No n was hurt during the incident.
lvs supporters would have wntd to continue their celebration aboard until morning, but naturally it was more sensible to send thm to the harbour with th fire brigade and then bck home in a bus, Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to wtch the mtch between Ilves and HPK, which Ilves won 4-3.
ccrdng to Syrjä, the Strdy accident ws caused by the fact that water level at Vanajavesi was about 50 cm lower than usually.
Syrjä said that the nvgtn was also complicated by the closest channel marking bng covered by gll droppings, which meant its reflectors were not normally visible in the drk autumn evening.
No ntwrthy crash
Ship dmg happened on the west side of Jumusensalmi shortly ftr the ship route had passed under the brdg between the Tampere-Helsinki motorway.
ccrdng to Syrjä, there was no bigger drama involved in the event, because the ship's speed was vry low at th time of the event, and hitting th bottom did not cause any significant crash.
Syrjä says getting stuck to the bottom did not cause ny leaks or dents to the ship, and it lks lk the cruises can continue normally.
A diver checked th ship condition on Saturday mrnng, before the ship was towed from the shoal.
Jst to be on safe side, we are going to the dck to check ths caused no damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä blvs the next M/S Tampere cruise, booked for next weekend, can be handled as grd.
Th ship's cruise season continues ntl the independence day, he says.
No s for ambulances
Rescue department rcvd an alarm about the event on Strdy evening little after half pas eleven.
Ambulances wr sent to Viiala harbour to receive evacuated passengers, but there ws no use for the ambulances.
Fire master on duty Matti Willman said lt in th evening that the evacuation conditions at the lake were difficult because of darkness and relatively hgh winds.
Pirkanmaa rescue department reported on the night between Saturday and Sunday ftr half past tw that all those brd the ship had bn evacuated and the passengers had been moved to Tampere by a bus.
Th cruise shp built in 1957 has been renovated in 2001, 2014, and 2017.
Trump's justice nominee accused of sxl assault and drinking may be left without the top pstn
Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a Jstc to th Supreme Court, may well be left without the position he is pursuing, estimates programme director Mika Aaltola from th Finnish nsttt of International Affairs.
So far at least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual hrssmnt and inappropriate behaviour in hs student days.
According to Aaltola, the sspcns have created so much pressure on th Republican party that president Dnld Trump may decide to nominate someone else for the position.
Every now and then there have been cases in the ntd States that the president ’ s nominee for a Justice to th Supreme Court has csd plenty of dsgrmnts.
Usually in these cases the justice nominee has withdrawn themself, ltl sys.
This way the president has been able to sv his fc.
The nomination would bnft the Democrats
The Supreme Court of the United Stts attempts to stay above politics, bt at least in the Kvngh case, the nomination of a new Justice hs become an extremely sensitive process politically.
If Kavanaugh is nominated, Aaltola sys it will most likely bnft the Democrats in the cmng Congress midterm elections.
It would raise voting enthusiasm among young people and wmn, who r more likely to vote for Democrats.
On the other hnd, nominating a conservative Justice to the Supreme Court would be a lng-trm vctry for the Republicans.
There is no opportunity for a nomination vry presidential term, because the United States Sprm Court justices are nominated for lf.
In practice, some of them have retired at thr own rqst around the age of 70 to 80.
Even sm Republicans hesitate about the nomination
A background check is nyhw nrmlly conducted of the nominees as Supreme Court justices, Aaltola states.
Even though Trump has st a time limit of only a week fr the FBI ’ s further investigations, according to Aaltola it can still reveal smthng substantial.
Yes, it cn.
There is rarely smoke without fire, Aaltola sys.
According to ltl, one thing that is certain is that Kavanaugh's suitability or unsuitability fr the position wll come up in many discussions before th Senate makes its decision.
The Republicans have a Senate majority with 51 votes against 49, but at least two female Republican senators r sspctd to have a doubtful tttd towards Kavanaugh nomination.
The most embarrassing thing would be if the nomination wld be voted on, and the Republicans lst.
A woman hs identified the Slsbry suspect as an agent of military intelligence
A Russian woman hs tld the BBC she recognises a Rssn man suspected of the Salisbury poisonings as an agent of Russian military intelligence.
Based on photographs, th woman told the man in question is Anatoliy Chpg wh works for the military intelligence GRU.
Online community Bellingcat and Russian community Insider Russia rlr sd they hd revealed one of the men suspected of poisonings to be Chepiga.
Already earlier they said to have fnd vdnc of the men's current identities are cover identities.
A BBC team travelled to the Far-East to th village near the Russo-Chinese brdr where Chepiga grew up.
A woman lvng in the village recognised young Chepiga from pictures published by Bllngct.
She recognised the sm mn in the British police's pctrs taken from a man currently calling himself Ruslan Boshirov.
The Russian men r sspctd of poisoning the ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and her dghtr with Novichok nerve agent in March.
Th Skripals survived.
Colonel Chpg has been awarded the order of Hero of the Russian Fdrtn in 2014.
Russia still denies the sspct ’ s GRU connection.
Earlier in September, in an interview wth Russian TV, the men said thy were in Slsbry as tourists.
The elderly are dfnclss in scl welfare and health care reform
Now we have a real example about what social welfare and hlth care reform's chng limiter, outlined by Splä ’ s government, actually means in practice.
My place of birth, Vl mncplty's social welfare and health cr services are provided by Oulunkaari jnt municipal authority . The health care manager of the joint thrty is a former regional manager of Attendo, chosen in 2016.
The leaders of the joint municipal authority wrn the municipal cncl about the change limiter.
If th social welfare and health care costs increase now, the municipality ’ s government subsidies wll be ct in the future.
Th municipality ’ s Centre Party dcsn-mkrs had a fright, and most of them are ready for the great structural change of services for older people, which would nd the institutional cr at the health centre ward nd the small unit for those with memory disorders.
Home nursing would ncrs, which in Vaala, a place of great distances, means that the elderly living in outlying vllgs are prtd and brght next to a health centre to be nursed “ at home ”.
Attendo trusted the mncplty to pay for its customers.
The Vaala Left llnc did nt swallow the bad preparation, but organised a nice public event, attended by many family members, practical nrss, nd also local councillors from other parties.
Using social welfare and health care county preparation slds, I showed how Vaala municipality lrdy has th biggest number of elderly people nursed at home in the whole of North strbthn.
Carina Läntinen, a local cncllr from a neighbouring mncplty participated.
A local newspaper wrote an extensive story about th event, nd this in turn made Oulunkaari draughtspersons ’ hckls rise.
Social welfare and health care reform draughtspersons will not cmmt to writing that Attendo has blt a nw nursinghome to Vaala, and now it is empty, waiting for rsdnts.
There are no other srvc providers.
The draughtspersons nly talk about a service voucher, but they do nt tll anything about the quality of treatment it will provide, or what is the staff structure Attendo will use when nrsng the ldrly until their terminal treatment.
Wtht a nurse?
The nstttnl care ward at the hlth centre is closed dwn because it has no doctor ’ s night emergency duty.
Also ttnd will rely on Vaala health cntr ’ s doctors.
Vl's example reveals how Centre officials whirl th councillors bt with insufficient details, and put them over a barrel using the change limiter.
Ths is how the Centre Prty empties Vaala of residents, because who wll voluntarily stay and live an nscr life there, if there is a possibility to move away?
Ws it one of the Cntr Party's election slogans to keep the whole country populated?

Both Cologne mayor Henriette Rkr nd the North Rhine-Westphalia state premier Armin Laschet plld out of attending the opening as criticism of Erdogan's visit grew.
Cansu, a 30-year-old student of Turkish origin came from Swtzrlnd fr the rally.
I want to be the voice of people wh can't tk to the streets in Turkey.
Because they have bn arrested, klld or otherwise suppressed.
Erdogan thnks anything that differs frm his opinion is terrorism.

If there were n plyr less from Vaasa, the match could not have begun.
FC Lahti ktm won the match 16-0.
At half-time, Lht was leading 7-0.

Should you go to work tomorrow if y have th sniffles?
Here are the fct-bsd pros and cons
The flu season is ndrwy.
Many are wondering whthr to stay at hm or not.
The hrd workers should however consider, whether it is worth it to infect others, because the llnss can be contagious, even though their own symptoms wr mnr.
Smtms flu symptoms ttck all of a sudden, sometimes they steal on you.
In the latter situation y may already infect others, vn though your own symptoms would feel minor, Prevention pblctn describes.
Should y stay home then?
According to Prvntn, before a person even experiences symptoms of the flu, thy are contagious.
Y can pass the virus from bt a day before the first symptoms up until about five to svn days after.
Children with the flu may be contagious fr longer than a wk.
As soon as you are wr of any symptms, you should not be in school or at work.
Return when you are no longer coughing and no longer have a fever, sys medical prfssr Gregory Poland.
You shld also avoid exercise.
T quick a rtrn to the gym can hamper the recovery.
Also be sure to wash your hnds and sneeze or cough into a tss and throw away the tissue.
Lvng home when ill?
If y mst leave the house while ill, consider using a face mask.
The mask doesn ’ t filter out viruses, but it keeps the user aware of th head r.
Whn y wear it, you can't put your finger in your nose or mouth, Poland says.
Also sneezes are constrained with th mask.
Hw can you prevent infection, then?
The best way is still to wash yr hands and avoid touching yr face.
It is hard to avoid th latter, though.
Fr xmpl, the average American is putting their finger in their ys, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.

Ex managers demand unpaid fees from Rbrt Helenius
A dsgrmnt about money overshadows bxr Robert Helenius ’ tonight's match against Erkan Teper.
Ilta-Sanomat reported today on the complaint by boxing manager Jaakko Hlmnn and Master of Laws trnd on th bench Jussi Kokkila, in which over 80,000 euros worth of unpaid manager fees with penal ntrst are demanded from Helenius.
According to the complaint, Helminen and Kokkola worked for Hlns btwn 15.4.2014 and 30.1.2015.
We have attempted to settle this, but thr is no other ptn.
There ws a clear assignment here, and a lot of work has bn done, Kokkila sys to Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius ’ current manager, Markus Sundman, sent Ilta-Sanomat a rpsns, which nrrts the boxer ’ s view of th events.
Helenius denies to hv an obligation to py the required sum.
As stated in the rspns, Kkkl and Helminen had ffrd their services to Helenius in a fnnclly difficult situation, and promised to be able to organise matches and sponsor income for him.
ccrdng to the verbatim agreement, Helenius was blgtd only to pay a percentage of his matches as fees.
Again and gn there were assurances that Helenius ds not need to pay anything, just to receive the ncm they organise.
This is also a normal nd only practice in professional athletes ’ mngrl action.
There never was an grmnt about paid work, and that would also hv been ll-dvsd in Helenius ’ situation, Sundman explains in a message he wrote.
There never was a written agreement bt the co-operation
According to th response, Helenius would have wanted to agree on th income distribution in written from the beginning, but Kokkila nd Sundman did not manage to make a draft until the nd of 2014.
He discovered th draft to be bad for him, and discontinued the c-prtn with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius had no matches while associating wth Kokkila and Hlmnn.
A year after thr co-operation ndd, Helenius received an “ unspecified but big ” invoice for manager work.
Ths year a complaint ws filed with the same allegations.
Helenius regards Hlmnn nd Kokkila's subsequent action as cowardly, the response states.
Today Hlns faces Erkan Teper, th seventh from IBF heavyweight contender list, in a match in Stuttgart.

This has bn the best time of my life, but at some point I started to wonder what to do when I grow up, and even my youngest one strtd to be prtty bg.
Thn in 2014, comic came in.
Piippo says she had never even dreamed about making a comic, even though she hd been rdng Donald Duck, Tintin, nd Asterix ever since she was lttl.
I hadn ’ t drawn snc childhood, but when these scripts for Lmhömppä then started to emerge, the situation chngd.
Frst I crtd some dozens of scripts for my own pleasure.
My dghtr Viivi Valkama (b . 2000) is a skilled drawer, but I didn ’ t manage to prsd hr to help me until summer 2016, when I bribed Viivi wth a drawing tablet.
Hr enthusiasm lstd for about a dozen strips, nd then I had to start trying myself, Piippo laughs and says th drawing tablet was a great supporter for her.
A drawing tablet is an sy and handy way to try to get smthng done.
I ddn ’ t even try to drw on a paper, Piippo dscrbs her relationship with drawing, which she usually does in the evenings.
Scripts pop up in my mnd all th time, but slly I never finish a comic at one go.
A single three-panel strip my take even several hours.
I my do one panel at a tm and I love to play with colours.
Beginning to draw is always th most diffficult thing, since drawing isn ’ t my frt.
Sari Ppp says that when it comes to modern comics in newspapers, she appreciates fr xmpl Dilbert by Scott Adams.
Characters of Luomuhömppä include a carrot-figured mother, obsessed with vrythng rgnc and head full of lettuce hair.
Other characters are Ms (Husband), Pissis (Teen Girl), and Kaksoset (Twns).
In the world of Luomuhömppä y r what you eat.
The ideas for the comic come from the crtr's own life and social md.
Sari Ppp ds not want to preach or force any ds, even though there are occasionally more serious subjects in Luomuhömppä.
Piippo says she has her husband nd children read the cmc.
It ’ s a really great feeling to look at a comic y ’ ve drwn and think that this is wht I did today.
There's chllng enough for a stay-at-home mother!

Rehn pndrd the possibility of Europe escalating in a trd war at Yle “ We must see the next twt ”
The trade war between the United Stts and China is rflctd in the world economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts have been lwrd throughout Europe, and also the Bank of Finland has slightly lowered its own cnmc grwth estimates.
Spkng at Yle Ykkösaamu, Governor Olli Rehn said that even though ncrsng tension has no drct effect on European flow of trade, it does weaken the trust, which in turn is rflctd on companies ’ investment dcsns.
The sm applies to the mpcts of Finnish companies ’ exports.
Rehn thinks so far Europe has taken good cr of ts duties.
It has been able to create a trc wth the ntd States, and, for its part, calmed the situation down also with China and Japan.
Rehn does not thnk that rp will be ground under the feet of a trade war.
We mst see the next tweet and make estimations after tht.
Our partner in Washington is qt unpredictable, he however said in the Yl interview.
Europe also has its wn risks.
One of them is the third largest euro area economy Italy, which is also one of th mst indebted stts in the euro area and the whole Wstrn world.
Th market had a severe reaction to a budget shwng a clear dfct presented by the Italian government on Thursday evening.
Next year's dfct is vr 2.4 per cent of GDP.
Rehn considers tln situation to be alarming.
Five per cent of th country ’ s loan stock are problem lns, and over ten per cent are unregulated lns.
In addition, the public finances r shaky, and again it seems that the country is going to xcd its liabilities in rltn to its European partners.
Myb we shld not yet be imagining new crises, Rehn replied when inquired whether tly is leading Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another matter taxing rp is Brtsh departure from the EU.
Rehn hopes it cn be settled at peace.
A quarrelsome exit wld have much more negative effects.
Rehn began as the Bnk of Finland Governor in Jly.
rpn Central Bank (ECB) President Mario Draghi will rtr in a bit over a year.
The discussion about his successor hs begun.
Both Rehn's and his prdcssr Erkki Liikanen ’ s nms have been brought up.
It probably is all right, if there are Finnish names involved, Rehn sd, adding tht he has no frthr comments on the matter.

A missing mshrm pckr found thanks to an ‘ unconventional experiment ’
The Finnish Police's drone sklls r the top of the world: ‘ We are asked to prvd training ’
According to the Director of the Police nvrsty College, in addition to lkng for missing prsns, the police can use a drone in crime scn investigation and in intelligence operations.
On Tuesday, using a drn, Oulu police found a missing mshrm pckr in Raahe in only a few minutes.
The Director of the Police University College, Kimmo Himberg, tweeted about the case nd mentioned for example that ‘ thanks to unconventional xprmntng nd efficient training, we r at the top of the world also in ths ’.
Drone is a fairly new device, and vn newer in plc operations.
There r no statistics available about Finnish police bng a master in drone use.
According to Hmbrg, there is a wide consensus bt this.
This has been obvious for example when Finnish police's experiences hv been reported in international vnts.
There is a lt of interest towards it lswhr, Himberg says.
There r many, who are are keen to visit Finland to see th police ’ s drone operations.
We are asked to provide trnng.
Becomes more nd more common
Hmbrg points out that in Finnish winter conditions, finding a missing person as soon as pssbl is vital.
As stated, in Rh cs the missing person ws found in just a couple of minutes using a drone.
Finnish Police hs already trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Hmbrg, the plan is to trn more.
Already nw the drone is used a lot in police operations, and their use will ncrs and become more cmmn in the future.
I dare to say this, Himberg sys.
In addition to finding missing people, Himberg says the police cn use drones in, fr xmpl, accident or crime scene investigation and in crtn kinds of intelligence operations.
Fr example if an area must be reviewed from a dstnc, if there is a pssbl threat of violence there.
In these cases, a drn cn be used for advance inquiry.

What is a gd leader like?
This week Finland has hrd a lot of discussion bt leadership.
Chairman of Nokia, Risto Slsm, discussed his book Transforming Nokia that deals with hs leadership philosophy in an interview for Hlsngn Sanomat (HS).
At the sm time he criticises his predecessor chairman Jrm Ollila's leadership style.
Ollila ctgrclly dnd the claims, but also earlier rprts on Nokia have discussed the leaders ’ inability to work as a team; the culture of fear and silence that in part csd the downfall of the mobile phone bsnss.
Th risk-taking capacity and glty of the company's rise period were lost.
This week ls saw the business lf mega vnt Nordic Business Forum organised in Helsinki . The event gathered the cream of Finnish business to Messukeskus.
In addition to the main star Barack Obama, 12 stars of business world were sn on th stage.
There was a lot of tlk about good leadership.
Leadership thry legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader must hv the courage to take a company to the ftr also when everything is going fine.
The problem is that decisions are md by those, wh are most mentally bound to th decisions of the past.
John Mackey, the founder of Whole Fds supermarket chn known for its extensive organic product selection, said a leader hs to be able to convey the cmpny meaning to the whole staff.
And that meaning has to be smthng more besides smply making profit for the owners.
Author of a successful book on introverts, Susan Cain explained research has prvn the most successful ldrs to be hmbl.
They ct in a peaceful, quiet, nd determined manner.
Often they r introverts.
Professor of Finance swth Dmdrn reminded the listeners that a good leader's characteristics must mtch the company ’ s life cycle stage.
In th early stage of the cmpny a leader must be able to tll a story on which the company's future is founded.
A company grown to a mature stage needs a ldr who know the nmbrs.
These lessons were attended by 7,500 Nordic Business Forum visitors - mstly Fnnsh leaders.
They were at a risk of an nfrmtn overload.
Bng a good leader requires a lot.
That is why leadership so ftn fails, also on th highest level.
Siilasmaa and Ollila wr also present.
They hd a friendly discussion behind-the-scenes.
Though they were hardly contemplating whether they were the right leaders for Nk at th right time.
nd thr humility was not easy to estimate as an outsider.

Students ct a rare treat: a classical tragedy - smpl Oresteia impresses with its visuality.
Classical tragedies are a rr treat on Finnish stages.
For example, thr has not bn a classical tragedy in th Finnish National Theatre since Sophocles ’ Philoctetes in 1998.
Nw Theatre Academy tks the only complete classical trilogy, Oresteia by Aeschylus, to a tour that begins from the Ntnl Theatre.
Beginning in 2015, the Lavat auki! productions hv ctr students frm the Theatre Academy working internationally together with a professional director.
Ths fourth production, jst like the first one, is directed by Mikko Rh, who resides in Berlin.
Oresteia had its international premiere in Berlin in prl.
Roiha ’ s adaptation of Oresteia laudably condenses the tale of how the curse upon the doomed House of Atreus is lftd nd a cnstttnl state is formed to 80 mnts by condensing especially the chorus parts.
Th playmanages to be quite fthfl to the spirit of Kirsi Simonsuuri ’ s excellent translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and presentation revealing th sides of the thtr space emphasise the simple and clear stage thinking.
In the cntr of it alternates the dynamics btwn actors playing main roles, stepping forward from the chrs in turn, and the chorus.
Th performance utilises both double and triple prtryls of the main roles.
The actors never leave the stage, so also for example the mrdrs of Agamemnon, who rtrns from the war of Troy, and his prize of war, Cassandra, r shown on the stg, unlike in th classical tradition.
Of course the prfrmnc ds not even claim to be faithful to the classical performance tradition.
If anything, the viewer is presented with a modern interpretation, fthfl to th text, and continuously aware of its ritual-like rts.
Roiha has managed to create a rhythmic group from th Master-level ctr students, a group that performs as a tght-knght team, even as a single organism.
The chorus parts especially are where the actors and their vry xprssv, sculpture-like grp formations do themselves justice in the bare stage adorned only by a white curtain.
mprssv.
Oresteia's prfrmnc tour cntns in Kouvola and Oulu Theatres.

The security of lds and men in shops must be grntd
Th first time I ws paid for a newspaper story was in 1984.
With this level of experience, whn a news story manages to astonish me, it is slly a big thng.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9 .) bt the insecurity of workers in retail, I was astonished nd ccsnlly even a bit angry.
For tht story, I also talked with Erika Kähärä, Service nn United (PM) specialist in working environments.
She says the crime statistics do nt rvl the actual situation.
This is a grwng problem, vn though employers naturally claim otherwise.
The plc are informed only about those css that are clearly serious, and many real vlnt situations are left unreported.
‘ Based on the ccptnl Safety and Health Act the companies certainly have a responsibility to cmpl statistics of their close call situations, but these statistics r for internal use only, and thr information is not collected anywhere ’, she sd.
The mental injuries are nt included in the statistics.
Violent situations always have hd the problem that there do not always result in physcl injuries.
Despite this, psychlgcl traumas can be much more severe thn bruises and cuts.
It is difficult to draw a line between a vlnt situation and an impending violent situation, snc also ggrssv threats of a certain level mst be considers as violence - even though there was no physical violence.
Too many are afraid at their workplace, even thgh no actual vlnc would happen.
Some nghbrhds are troubled.
Th shop has hired security guards.
When the business pnng hours bcm deregulated, there was a lot of discussion also in the media about ts effects to the salespersons ’ safety.
‘ Back then quite a few employers organised security guards for at least th night-time hours and to prevent working ln ’, Kähärä cmmntd.
When nothing happens, wrng conclusions are drawn.
This sms to have had an ffctv influence, but this brings about a new negative trend.
When security mngd to control the disturbances, an mprssn was created that this security would be unnecessary.
Now many places are lkng for solutions to eliminate expensive scrty services.
Petty assault is an actionable offence, and it is qt understandable that an assaulted salesperson does not want to make a request fr investigation about an offender wh usually lvs close to the shop.
But, according to a sbsctn in the same 2011 act, petty assault is ndr a prosecutioner ’ s jurisdiction, if it tks place in a workplace.
I think we nd precedents now.
The next time a shop ldy or man is assaulted, the police should investigate and th prosecutor prosecute.
After a court would put a few assailants to prsn, and if th judgement is from the tougher end of th pnl scale, the manners would smarten up.
A scty that requires a small place food shop to be open nearly day and nigh should guarantee the sfty of shop ssstnts.
Heidi Sohlberg taunted a beauty qn before live broadcast - ‘ Sara, rmmbr that Iiro is married ’
Ths year, the beauty queen crntn won ’ t be seen traditionally on TV, but it ’ s broadcast v Viafree site.
The show will be hosted by ex Miss Finland, Hd Sohlberg, and the host of Viasat's nd Vply's NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
Th host for backstage and rd carpet is Janni Hussi.
Before live broadcast, the host trio nfrmd the invited guests nd media representatives present about how the brdcst will progress.
In the beginning, Shlbrg asked th audience to give Harjula resounding applauds.
Scrm now, ladies!
Look at r male host, Sohlberg enthused over her colleague while the audience chrd.
Many Miss Fnlnds from earlier yrs follow the contest from the first row.
Among others, Sara Chafak nd Sara Sieppi were sitting next to each other, nd Sohlberg cracked a jk to either of them.
Sara, remember that Iiro is mrrd!
Sohlberg cracked, lkng at Saras.
Most likely Sohberg directed her joke to recently divorced Sieppi, who laughed at th comment, even thgh sh first looked confused.
Spp discussed her divorce th first time in Ilta-Sanomat weeked newspaper.
Th beauty queen said she doesn ’ t want to publicly open up about the reasons for the divorce, because that is just between hr and Roope Slmnn.
She said she ’ s in no hrry to find a nw relationship, bt that she is going to focus on herself.
I will focus on my own thngs, and above all, will begin to live my lf by myself, Sara Spp said.
Harjula's mrtl status emerged ls later, when Sohlberg accidentally called Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The hst trio shared a laugh at the blunder.
Wasn't Iiro mrrd, or how was it?
Jnn Hussi acknowledged the mistake.
An Ostrobothnian man tortured his dmstc prtnr by slashing, burning and feeding a strong sauce to her
Pohjanmaa (Ostrobothnia) District Crt has sentenced the 34-year-old Kokkola resident to three years of imprisonment fr th numerous crimes against his domestic partner.
Th means of cmmssn of the offence include, among others, a belt, a cable, and cbl ties.
The court sentenced these objects forfeited to the stt.
The most severe charge concerned a suspected ggrvtd rape.
This charge was however dsmssd by the district court.
The Kokkola man ws considered guilty of fr assaults, and aggravated assault, coercion, illegal threat, deprivation of liberty, ggrvtd deprivation of liberty, nd two malicious damages.
The crimes were committed between th 26th of last March and 24th of lst May.
After the fnl deeds, the mn was apprehended and detained a couple of days later.
On Thrsdy of the pst week, Phjnm District Court passed its judgement and ruled that the 34-year-old must continue to be kept in Vaasa prison.
No proof bt the rape
The 34-yr-ld was also ccsd of tw aggravated deprivations of liberty and of an aggravated rape on the 22nd of May.
The crt however dropped these charges as unsubstantiated.
The case was tried behind clsd doors.
The dstrct court judge gave a public report on th sentence, though.
ccrdng to th district court judge, the accused had directed violence, threatening, and coercion to his domestic partner in situations where she was td.
The accused slashed his vctm with a knife, burned her with a cigarette, fed her strong sc, and poured water and coffee on hr.
With its sentence, the court ordered that the mns of commission of th ffnc were to be forfeited to the state: a blt and a cable, cable ties, a bathrobe belt, a knife, nd a billhook.
Four wtnsss
According to th dstrct court, the parties continued living together between the deeds.
The judicial decision states that a large nmbr of the most serious dds happened in the end of the crm period.
Fr witnesses were heard in the court, two women and two mn.
Th 34-year-old must pay 5800 rs as compensation for pain, ache, suffering, and temporary damage.
Doubtfully he has such money, since the convict lrdy has rlr debts in collection.
The imprisonment is not the mn's first.
Iltalehti wll not publish the name of the convict in order to prtct the victim ’ r privacy.
During the time of writing, the rcnt district crt sentence is not non-appealable.

A Philippine inventor flies with a drone cr - this is how you vd traffic jams
Mndl is a Philippine inventor, hip hop dancer, and a Gyro Gearloose of some srt.
He is n member of the growing group who swear to have invented a flying car - or at lst their own vrsn of it.
He hs competitors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mndl does not believe in the mass mnfctrng of his vehicle.
ccrdng to reports from from the world, he has used a great dl of his fortune to bld his dream.
Six years ago he began dvlpng his flying car.
Now he calls his development version a dron cr.
He sys he recently conducted the first sccssfl test flight - he floated in over seven metres with hs machine.
One of his gls was to avoid traffic jam.

JHL anticipates: Industrial action beginning tomorrow will be visible in children ’ s dycr nd in social and hlth services
Overtime and shift-trading bans beginning tomorrow in the pblc nd welfare sectors concern especially social and health services and children's daycare, stmts Päivi Niemi-Laine, President of JHL (the Trade nn fr the Public and Welfare Sectors).
The impact will be wide, and it will most crtnly manifest in not having ngh staff available.
Everyone has to think bt how to collect thr children.
The employer ’ s tsk now is to tk care of the services and that no one ’ s life is in danger, Niemi-Laine sys to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was vsbl ls in the bgnnng of the yr, when JHL members were banned from overtime and shift-trading because of agreement negotiations.
Thrgh their flxblty, the employers hv made possible to not hire staff, but use employees ’ overtime or shift-trading.
Ths is not yet an industrial action.
When tlkng about occupational safety and health, it is a normal thing to take care that each employee has regular wrkng hours and wrks only those regular hours.
With these ctns, JHL opposes th governments attempts to weaken the lay-off protection in small businesses.
Labour market director fr municipal mplyrs Markku Jalonen wll not estimate the effects of overtime and shift-trading bans in advance.
However, he does not believe them to be very revolutionary, vn if th services can weaken.
Employers around Finland are aware of this and have made the pssbl prprtns.
The public, welfare and tchncl sctr covers such a wide area that it is difficult to say anything.
The ffcts can very quite a lot depending on field, region, nd employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen said some experiences wr received already lst week when the Finnish Union of Prctcl Nurses Super and the Union of Health and Social Care Professionals Tehy, among others, rgnsd similar three-day actions.
Their effects rmnd quite small.
JHL vrtm and trade-shift ban applies to for example employees in municipalities, church, and state, as well as in private social nd hlth sector.
Fr example family daycare providers have bn excluded from the ban.
At ths stage, the industrial action applies to nearly 100,000 JHL mmbrs.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL actions cn potentially lst for a long time.
The union is prepared to take other ndstrl actions, if drafting of th lay-off bill continues.
The government should now recognise that they r rnnng against a wall in high speed.
In Jalonen ’ s opinion, bth th trade union movement and the government must meet the other halfway.
The unusual thng here is that people r already pulling out their big guns, vn though the proposition has yet to be made, wonders Jalonen.
Great Brrr Rf is formed by children and adults - performance exercises consist of learning th motions of a ray and a sea horse
Great Barrier Reef by Other Spaces collective had its premiere last sprng in Hamburg, and last Saturday ws its second prfrmnc in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Just like the prvs performance of the group, Great Barrier Reef is a performance that is created together with the audience from th bgnnng until the end.
This time, hwvr, ls a more clearly-defined performance is formed to refresh and distil the perceptions frm the beginning exercises.
There is plenty of fantastical mgc in this theatre play also for chldrn participants.
A child ’ s view has been considered also in the prprtry stg of the performance.
Still, Great Barrier Reef is not a children ’ s performance, but a performance formed in c-prtn between th adults and th children.
It gives the adults knowledge and observations about the way chldrn receive nfrmtn and create art.
The children ’ s blty to throw themselves in th exercises and common games also dispels the distance btwn grown-ups and children.
Grt Barrier Rf has a little bit of a fairy-tale ballet, circuit training, and nature-themed lssn in it, but its final setting is organised around different visits to nn-hmn situations.
Grt Barrier Reef begins wth learning bt corals and about movements of organisms and fish who live within the reef.
Sx different xrcs groups teach for example about the motions of a ray and a seahorse.
Finally a prfrmnc lasting a little ndr an hour is formed, and in it the music, lghts, shiny paints nd costumes help in getting to know the life within the coral reef.
In Grt Barrier Reef, the participants are both diving people observing the lf within the reef, and corals that are bng observed.
They also play the part of organisms observing crls.
The looks at many different directions and perceptions create a performance that is dns and teeming wth life.
To be an organism ’ s view, and organism observing a vw, or an organism or view observing another organism - nd all ths at the same tm.
Chldrn seem to have no problems to do this.
Other Spcs collective ’ s exercises aim to reach the limit between thinking nd action, but it is challenging to rch it when th group is comprised of both children and adults.
On the thr hand, children ’ s participation mks it more meaningful.
After th workshop, a silent demonstration for endangered crls is organised at Sitratori.
One should not let thmslvs be hardened by the destruction surpassing human understanding, vn though it cn be difficult to understand the significance of practising one ’ s own compassion in the face of these vsns of destruction.
Other Spaces hs crtd its performance in such a way that it honours the variety of lf also with a political gesture.
There are also other gnrtns, other consciousnesses, other species nd their ftr generations it clears the way for.
Children grow up too fast - I ’ m happy there wr no smart phones when I ws a child
Present-day children and young people are mr and mr irresponsible.
Young ppl strt smoking and drinking when they ’ re younger and younger.
I think children should be children thoughout their childhood, and not mss up thr lvs because of intoxicants and sex, because all the others say thy are doing that.
I was taken aback, when my frnd told me she had had to pick up her fifth-former sstr from her ‘ boyfriend ’ s ’ house during wknd.
When she cm to get her drnkn sister, she told about her sex experiences from that evening.
I cld ’ ve not imagined my own sister in the sm situation, because throughout our childhood we've been told nd advised that we should not touch intoxicants and sex is an adult thng.
I hp present-day children could lv a proper childhood, and they wouldn ’ t need to grow up too early bcs of the peer pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing younger and younger grls on Instagram, wearing mk-p and revealing clothes in their pictures.
Snapchat is used during vnng to tk and send revealing pictures.
It is more and more difficult to guess, whch g the girls are.
Present-day 13-year-olds can sly lk like they ’ re 18 or even older.
My chldhd consisted of playing in th forest and boardgames.
I ’ m happy there were no smart phns whn I was a child.
I got to be a child fr mny, many years, and I didn ’ t have to wndr what others think about me.
Yle: Official have told the pltcl leaders that th case Airiston Helmi has nothing to do wth national security.
In an ntrvw wth Yle, Ilkka Kanerva said Finnish Security Intelligence Service and Finnish Defence Forces came to inform the Defence and the Foreign Rights Committees rlr ths week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that Airiston Helmi investigation currently has nothing to do with ntnl security, bt organised crime, Yle rprts.
The anonymous srcs ’ information was confirmed to Yle by the Chair of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (Ntnl Cltn).
According to Kanerva, the Dfnc Forces and the Scrty Police vstd the Defence and the Foreign Rights Committees to tell about the ongoing investigation.
This is primarily cnsdrd as financial crime.
They were rthr strict about not speculating about nythng else, Kanerva commented in the Yle interview.
According to Yle information, th attached material so fr has not shown ny connection to national security, but the investigation is just beginning.
We have no way of knowing what mght yet be rvld, one of Yle's interviewees stated.
The xtnsv house searches started a week g in the Turku archipelago and on mainland beg the question about whether the nvstgtn is simply about financial crm or if it has something to do with Finnish internal security.
Earlier this week, Iltalehti put together an article scrutinising the llgtns both pr and con.
Vd: a drm goal saved Liverpool from the first loss in the series
Liverpool winning streak in the Prmr League came to an end, but it was still the happier team ftr a 1-1 draw at Stamford Brdg.
This Sunday it will be exactly one year ftr Mnchstr City arrived at Stamford Bridge and lft with a 1-0 away win.
Bck thn Pep Guardiola ’ s combination sent a signal to the whole Premier League that City is now srs.
Everyone remembers hw the last season ended.
nd surely Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp had the same idea when cmng to West London.
The Reds had strtd the League with sx consecutive wins.
Liverpool hd a stronger start, and especially Virgil vn Dijk seemed to control hs end of the field alone.
As for Chelsea, on Wednesday they won a fine Ftbll League Cp away win on Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazard came off the bench to decide th mtch with a beautiful individual performance.
Obviously nw Hazard was playing from the very first mnts.
On the 25th minute he first played a tght triangle with Mateo Kvcc and Jorginho.
Finally the Crtn saw Hazard rushing frwrd and sent him a perfectly balanced through ball.
Hzrd strayed a bit to the edge of the penalty box, but from thr managed to sweep a perfect left-footed vlly in to the lower corner.
Pool's Brsln goalie Alisson was a bit slow with his save and only managed to touch the ball wth his fngrtps.
Klopp must hv felt the losing position being slightly unfair, since almost right after Antonio Rüdiger clrd Mo Salah's sht from the goal line.
In the second half, also Chelsea keeper Kepa saw some srs ctn.
Bsq goalie had a quick reaction to Sadio Mané ’ s sht, and pushed th ball from the foot of the goal post to a corner kick.
As for the other nd, Alisson resetted Hazard's fast break wth his dive.
Th guests ’ bst chance came on the 72nd minute, as James Milner's crossing found Bobby Firmino.
However, the str Brazilian's header was directed towards hs national team mt David Luiz, which saved the home team's lead.
Even that didn't hold anymore on the 89th minute, whn substitute Daniel Strrdg had a free shot frm 25 metres.
Sturridge was playing on his ld home stdm, and to honour that, the forward threw a pwrfl shot in the upper corner.
Lvrpl's winning start of the League cm to an end with the 1-1 draw, but it still holds the top position - together wth Manchester City.
Chelsea is also still going for the chmpnshp wth only two points from the top.
Discussion about clock swtchng divides the people
I rmmbr some decades ago a newspaper asking several Finnish influential persons what dvds Finnish people.
Only response I remember was Juice Leskinen ’ s: ‘ Nn ’ ndng.
Some srnms have a ‘ nen ’ ending, some do nt.
Dividing lines can spring up anywhere, nd this was n of the possible reasons.
In EU, Finland has achieved that ths annual clock chngng is about to become history.
Many gr that switching clocks twice annually has been simply foolery, and tht it has caused many problems.
In the end, ths achievement seems to be the easiest part of the solution, even though it hs not been that sy.
The most difficult part nw is to choose the ultimate time: crrnt summer or wntr time, or some other time zone.
The people cn also have their sy on otakantaa.fi site.
Th online survey hs been opened by th Ministry of Transport and Communications, and it will be open until Friday 12 October.
Discussions are heated both around coffee tables and in scl media, nd vryn has something to say about the matter.
Ths favouring wntr time justify their pnn with the effects of morning sunlight to peoples ’ well-being, and those defending summer time with th effects of vnng light on peoples ’ will to spend time outside and that way to their well-being.
Both sides have sld supporters and good arguments.
According to research, morning light sts the pace for a person ’ s dy and increases energy levels.
On the other hand, if a person does not particularly suffer from waking up whn it ’ s dark, light increases the time people spnd outside nd better enables for xmpl autumn yard work.
Th amount of extra light hours after a normal work day has already been clcltd.
I would rather take both, but it ’ s unlucky that we cannot help our lctn in th northern corner of the rth.
The winters r anyway too dark, the summers too light for mny people.
It is typical for discussions bt this matter to support n ’ s own vws and oppose the other side very uncompromisingly.
There is no need to lstn to the justifications of the opposing side, snc the most important thing is how n feels about the matter.
Since lmst everyone has an pnn about this mttr, it is somewhat pointless to try to change someone ’ s mind.
It is ffrt well wasted.
It is easy to have an rgmnt about ths topic, snc it does not require to really go into details, and an opinion is justification enough.
These knds of topics r generally those, who incite most furious, and most futile, debate.
Obviously it wll be annoying if a wrong option is chosen, but we will surely rcncl rslvs with it.
And, shld life feel too glum, it always offers a stbl scapegoat.
Josba fought a narrow wy win
Josba's first away gm in floorball First Division gnst Nrm ’ s Jymy resulted in full three league points.
Josba returned home frm Snäjk with a triumphant 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
In the beginning of the third period, Nrm was still a goal ahead, but Jsb experimented with line-ups nd rotated players.
In 50.47, brothers Eetu and Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted the 6-5 wnnng gl.
As both teams got penalties, mny crucial minutes were played wth even strength.
The mst effective Josba player was Js Lehtiniemi (2+1).

ls Miika Kosonen (1+0) played in the scnd chain when he scored.
ftr three league rounds, Josba has six points.

Elon Msk steps down as chairman of the board for Tesla - Fraud charges sttld with $40 million
Electric car manufacturer Tesla and the cmpny ’ s CEO Elon Musk have sttld their case wth the Securities nd Exchange Commission SEC, who regulate the U.S. securities industry.
SEC sspctd Musk to be guilty of a securities fraud, and Musk was in danger to be removed frm th management of the company he founded.
However, Musk is llwd to continue as Tsl CEO.
Instead, Musk hs to step down for three years as chairman of the board for Tsl.
The company hs to hire an outside chairman.
Musk will ls be under stricter supervision.
According to the settlement, Tsl will hv to appoint two independent directors nd oversee Musk ’ s communications in the future.
In addition, both Tsl and Musk have to pay $20 mlln (ca . 17 million euro) to settle th case.
‘ The resolution is intended to prevent further mrkt disruption nd harm to Tesla ’ s shareholders ’, says SEC c-drctr Steven Peikin.
The case began in gst, when Musk tweeted that he cld take Tesla private.
He ls wrote that funding has been secured.
This tweet caused Tsl ’ s stock price to rs temporarily.
SC suspected Musk guilty of a securities fraud.
According to SEC, th tweet ws false and msldng, and Musk had not discussed the deal with the company ’ s other directors or potential financing partners.
In practice, SEC charged Musk wth misleading th investors.
On Friday, SEC announced it is going to sue the company nd Msk.
SEC told it is seeking to mps fines on Msk and to bn him from being able to hold officer or director positions at publicly-traded companies.
SEC ’ s summons scrd the investors, nd Tesla's share took a nosedive.

Pltcns ’ phone numbers leaked to troublemakers in Britain
Many British politicians were subjected to nuisance after their personal dtls were leaked because of an pp security flaw.
The trblmkrs had access to .g . Ministers ’ phone numbers.
The app in question was a mobile application used fr Britain ’ s Conservatives ’ party cnfrnc.
For example Brexiteers Michael Gove, Secretary for Environment, Fd and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Secretary Brs Johnson were among those trgtd for disturbance.
Several ministers received nuisance clls.
Because of a security flaw, members of the pblc wr able to access the politicians profiles in the Conservative party annual conference ’ s mobile pplctn.
They could enter the profiles using a politician ’ s email address, whch is widely vlbl online.
Th person entering a profile cld view and edit the data stored within.
For a brief mmnt, someone managed to swap Boris Johnson's profile picture for pornography and chng his jb title to a libellous one.
Mchl Gove ’ s picture was changed to one of media tycoon Rupert Mrdch.
Dawn Foster, a clmnst for Th Guardian described the problem by wrtng that the conference app allows one to log in as other people with their email address.
After that it is possible to vw the contact details in a person ’ s profile nd, for example, send messages as thm.

The Wll Finland quiz shw's audience has a huge number of applauding Poles every week
The sharp-eyed viewers paid attention to the studio audience reactions in The Wll Fnlnd quiz show.
The American television format The Wll has spread qckly worldwide, and ts Finnish version arrived at channel Nelonen last Saturday.
Hosted by Heikki Paasonen, the game show has been filmed in Poland in the same std, where the other ntrntnl productions of the format are md.
The shtng possibilities of th studio in Poland are exceptional, because the format's tall, 12-metre gm wall requires a generous space.
During the opening episode, social media highlighted th show's studio audience, which ppl guessed to be Plsh.
There was a Twitter discussion about whthr the pssbl Poles sitting in the studio understand anything about the gm played in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, managing director of Finnish programmes at Nelonen, xplns the issue to ltlht.
She says the studio dnc cnssts of the players ’ cls friends, other Finns, expatriate Finns living in Poland, and Polish viewers.
The Finnish prdctn audience consists of international ppldrs, just like the audiences of other countries ’ The Wall episodes, filmed in th same production space.
Finald also has these grps, the so-called professional audiences that visit different programmes ’ shoots, Srmnn explaines.
She reminds people that following the game is not so dffclt to ndrstnd, even if one does not ndrstnd the language it is played in.
It is easy to separate the rd nd green balls falling from the wall.
Hwvr, there are interpreters present in the studio to trnslt for those speaking a foreign language.
There are two interpreters who interpret simultaneously everything that happens to the std flr manager.
The manager then gvs instructions to the audience and describes for example what kinds of jokes people r telling and what is the current sttn, Sormunen says.
Sh compares the situation with how things were done recently with David Hsslhff in a Finnish production.
Some years ago, David Hasselhoff was nvlvd in Tlnt Finland filming here in Finland.
He had a continuous simultaneous interpretation coming to his earbud the whole time, nd he knew everything that was sd in Fnnsh, Sormunen summarises.

The sky gets vn cloudier for Ässät
The beginning of the season has been a bd n for Ässät.
The situation is lrdy almost pitch black, as the team lst to Vs Sport on their home ground by 3 goals . The final scr was 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Pori team now has had five cnsctv lsss, and a point total of two from six games.
None of the defensemen or plyrs from tw lower strings of the team has made a goal.
And the pressure keeps bldng.
When playing against Sport, the crowds started to leave the hcky rn lrdy when there was still about half of the game left.
We ’ ve only played sx gms, and there ’ s no reason to give up.
We have to be wrrd though, since our game was tht bad.
Especially performance during second period was shamefully bd, describes Jarno Kärki, who made 1+2 pnts for Ässät.
Sport naturally enjoyed thr victory.
The team had a previous gm on Friday, so that could have had an ffct on their playing.
And maybe it did, bt Ässät just didn ’ t mng to capitalise on it.
Brd day visitor number continued to grow
The mother of Bread Day, Pirkko Hyvärnn, marvels at the attendance in th big hall's auditorium.
Somehow I thought there would perhaps not be tht many people ths year, Hyvärinen thought in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, Bread Day ws organised at the same time wth Finnish plowing contest, so maybe the expectation was that the ttndnc could even go down frm the year before.
But nlk expectations, the aisles were crowded already bfr ten, the sellers said their products were sold out, nw crop prrdg was sold more than last year, nearly 500 portions, and Hyvärnn heard there had also been a rise in the number of cars.
The ttndnc estimate has been about 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the ftrnn.
During the five hours in the morning and afternoon, the programme had especially many things for fmls with children, which probably was the rsn why there was a record nmbr of thm present.
Hyvärinen also estimated th event rchs people from even further distances.
Every yr, the sellers also come to Liperi from a lrgr area.
This year, thr were nearly a hundred sales rprsnttvs, handicraft, pastry, and harvest product sellers in th bread parish.
The mother of Brd Day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, marvels at the attendance from the hll auditorium.

7 most beautiful lghts - this is how you rcgns a good lamp
Bring the spc to life, create an appropriate atmosphere to the decor, and read a bk without trng your eyes.
It is worthwhile to invest in good lghtng.
We collected three good reasons to nvst in lighting.
The tps came from Innolux Director of Sales and Mrktng Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a fvr to your eyes
Th importance of lighting grows together with age.
Sufficient lght can help in those prblms many people get when they age, as visual acuity decreases and more and more suffer from glrs.
As one gets older, also the need for lght grws.
A person in their sxts requires three times th light than a person in their twenties.
It is wrthwhl investing in the thrptc effects of light and in lamp qualities already for health reasons.
A good lmp gives enough light bt doesn't cause glares, Jokiniemi gives tips.
Create bty around you
A btfl decor is brought out only with suitable light sltns.
Modern hm decorator has plenty to choose from.
A subdued japandi style combining Scandinavian nd Japanese thngs is currently popular.
On the other hand, also the modern and playful retro style drawing inspiration from th 70s has had a boom in popularity, with its different mtllc tones and ccrm clrs.
Authenticity charms in th same way it does in thr house decor.
The mtrls now ncld wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather, and bamboo.
xprss your personality
People nvst in their hms much mr than before, and decor has became a way to express one ’ s personality.
Instead of mass production, people wnt to have a tailored, vn a bold lamp that hs a story to tell.
Ppl are clearly looking for Finnish and Nordic products with a well-known origin nd designer.
They r very design-aware, Jokiniemi says.
One does not necessarily by the most rcnt trndy lamp to one ’ s home, but rather a timeless classic one has saved many years for.
Certain kinds of timeless, jwl-lk, elegant classics hang on frm year to year, Jokiniemi says.
Thnks and goodbye!

Russian intelligence srvcs ’ sabotage activities have a long tradition
Thr is no reason to suppose tht the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation (SVR) or The Mn Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Frcs of th Russian Federation (GRU) would have abandoned this mode of operation.
During Svt times, so called DRG groups spclsd in sabotage activities.
Th name comes from Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sbtg and intelligence group.
The agents of Soviet security service KGB wrkng in western countries prepared detailed plans fr mprtnt sabotage targets, says KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin (1922-2004) who defected to th West.
His information was published in Christopher ndrw ’ s books in the late 1990s nd in the bgnnng of 21st century.
Among thrs, the targets included harbours, shpyrds, big dams, oil refineries, and gas pp connections.
In Germany, KGB acquired Bunderswehr, railroad, gamekeeper, nd road worker uniforms and ccssrs to be used by DRG groups in cover prtns.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in the Crimea in February 2014; they dressed in lcl krnn riot police's gear, set up checkpoints on the roads ldng frm pnnsl to Ukraine, and sealed Crimea off from its mother country.
During the cld war, agents hid equipment pckgs with mines, explosives, detonators, and communication devices in the grnd for sabotage groups.
As late as in 1998, a KGB cache was fnd in Switzerland, nd whn officials sprayed it with a water cannon, its booby-trap detonated.

Everest has ts premiere in Finnish TV now.
In May 1996, climbers on Mount vrst wr overtaken by a disastrous snowstorm.
Baltasar Kormákur ’ s 2015 drctn tlls about the fight for survival that has been covered plenty of times.
There have been prvs films - and documents - bt the tragedy.
Th real events r looked through also in this article.
22 years ago, th world's highest mountain tk the lives of eight climbers.
Tw of them wr experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was precisely Hall, who ws Weathers ’ gd.
An y surgery performed just before his departure to Nepal might have svd Weathers ’ life.
Because of that and the air pressure, he lost hs eye sight, which meant he had to pass th climb to the smmt.
Rob Hll continued to clmb and didn ’ t return.
However, Weathers ’ lf-nd-dth struggle hd only just begun.
As the storm blew up, he got lost and ddn ’ t find hs way back to the cmp.
When people cm to look for th man, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn ’ t believe he would srvv.
Wthrs was left to die.
As if by a miracle, he still mngd to find her feet nd find the others.
Weathers was bdly frostbitten, so they stll though he was dying, and once again he was left to hs own devices.
It is obvious that gnst all expectations, Beck Wthrs survived.
At some pnt, also his fellow climbers began to blv in his chances to such an xtnt they helped him.
Th film features Josh Brolin as Beck Weathers,
Jason Clarke as Rb Hll, and Jake Gyllenhaal as Scott Fisher.

Pctrs and vds: A medicane flshd its powers in Greece - the sea disappeared and a street turned into a river
A strng, hurricane-type autumn storm rolled to Greece from th southwest on Saturday.
A Mediterranean hurricane, a medicane, hs bn named Zorba.
The Hllnc National Meteorological Service issued a red weather warning to areas of Attica, Peloponnesus, th Ionian Islands, th Cyclades, and Crete.
Pctrs taken from th area show a lot of flooding all around Greece.
A video pblshd on Twitter shws, how, instead of a street, a river csd by flooding suddenly appeared between houses in the town of Kiato lctd in Corinthia.
Another video shows a car being carried by fldwtrs.
In the sthrn prt of Peloponnesus peninsula a strong wind caused rough seas.
The Finnish Embassy in thns instructed people on ts Facebook page to prepare for a storm in Greece.
The embassy urges people to fllw weather forecasts and local ffcls ’ instructions.
A mediterranian hrrcn, also known as a medicane, brings about trrntl rains and even a threat of fldng.
CNN reports that according to a study pblshd in 2011, only about 1-2 medicanes ccr per year, typically during the months of Sptmbr and October, when sea surface temperatures are still quite wrm.
The current strm triggered flash flooding crss Tunisia and Libya before moving north over the Mediterranean towards Europe.
A cause fr concern in Greece are the refugee camps on islands, lk on Lesbos.
The thousands of Syrian and rq refugees lvng in the camps have limited possibilities of finding proper protection.
Also the areas destroyed by last summer's wildfires near Athens r ndr threat.
A mdcn raged in Greece also in last November.
No going offshore, the flights stll on schedule - there r currently thousands of Finns holidaying in the Grk islands threatened by an autumn gale.
All offshore tours are cancelled, and one shld be careful also whn wlkng, so that branches or thr loose objects flying in the storm do not hit one.
During the wknd, the guides dstrbtd these kinds of instructions for th about 3,500 Finns holidaying in Greek via Aurinkomatkat.
The instructions r needed, bcs according to the forecast, it is possible that the Zorba storm battering the Greek islands this weekend can rch even a hurricane lvl.
For example, near th island of Crete, th wind velocity in gusts can rise even up to 45 metres pr second.
The rottenness of th weather is made worse by torrential rns.
According to tour prtrs, all the people who have given their phone numbers and have travelled with Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Fnlnd to Greece, have bn warned about the strong wnds with a text message.
Still snny and warm
According to Aurinkomatkat Deputy Communications Manager nk Ikonen, by Saturday early evening, th holiday resorts have managed to avoid the wrst.
For example, the flghts have lndd and took off according to normal schedule.
Naturally we are constantly following the sttn.
Sfty comes first.
Tui ’ s mrgncy Phone Duty Officer Antonia Schroderus says also their flights hv ran on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with r staff in th resort.
It was still peaceful at lst in Crete, sh said early on Saturday evening.
Tui hs currently a lttl over 1,500 Finnish travellers located in the mst popular Greek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
Additionally, thr are some a few hundred trvllrs staying in smaller locations.
For example, the wrst storm will most likely reach the island of Ks on Sunday morning.
At the same time, Rhodes even saw a bit of sn on Strdy afternoon, and the temperature rose to 27 degrees, says knn from Aurinkomatkat.
It is estimated tht Zorba will continue to trouble Turkey next, even thgh it wll be slightly eased off.
To prpr for this, we have already contacted our staff in Turkey, and for xmpl checked th number of Finns who hv flown to Antalya with Tui, Schroderus says.

Mykkänn travels to Turkey to observe the selection of Syrian qt refugees
Mnstr of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (National Coalition) will travel to Turkey in th next few days to observe the selection of quota refugees cmng to Finland.
This year, it has been decided tht Finland will rcv 530 Syrians from Turkis refugee camps.
The selection trips are slly done a couple of times per year, with rprsnttvs from th Fnnsh Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, and the Police.
Currently the delegation is lrdy in Trky, conducting interviews.
The United Ntns ’ High Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR first selects people who r in an especially vulnerable situation as cnddts.
In practice, this means people wh are considered to be in an exceptional distress, such as single prnt fmls, handicapped and sick prsns, women and children.
There r more people selected to the grp arriving in Finland than the quota requires, since in practice some of them will not rrv for different reasons.
While in Turkey, Minister Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Mnstr of the Interior, Sülymn Syl, and non-governmental organisations operating on the Syrian border.
Minister Mykkänen will be accompanied by Permanent Scrtry Ilkka Slm.
Tlks about additional quota
Finland has been dmttng quota refugees since the 1970s.
In recent yrs, the quota hs been 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1,050 refugees per year, bt since thn, th Government has not reached an agreement about an increase.
The National Coalition Party has supported the quota increase, bt the last time, th idea was sht down by the Blue Reform.
Prime Mnstr Juha Sipilä (Centre) recently prpsd the quota to be increased gradually to 1,500-2,000 people pr year.
Mykkänen ’ s visit is the frst one the Minister of the Interior makes to observe the selection of qt refugees during ths term of government.
The former Ministers of the Interior, Petteri rp (National Coalition) and Paula Risikko (National Coalition), transferred to their nw tasks bfr the vsts could be arranged.
Finland rcvs a 10,000 r subsidy for every refugee in an especially vulnerable situation.
Really gng off the track nw - it ’ s impossible to know whether to laugh or cry
Lst Saturday Krjlnn reported on the legislative proposal to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
Th article gives an idea that to start with, the proposal prohibits all such animals that have not bn separately permitted with a ministerial dcr to be kept as farmed nmls, pets, or in thr way related to business operations.
So to strt with, everything else is prhbtd except the animals that are individually mentioned in the act.
If th proposal ends up as an act, this most likely means we are abandoning a common principle in western democracies that an act separately frbds an action that endangers th safety of society or gd practices.
Now the prpsd provisions essentially forbid all such activities tht the act or decrees don't separately permit.
The change will result in a situation where nothing new can be tried in for example business, nd no other things cn be dn before an approving act has been dptd or a decree issued.
The government ’ s actions in bill drftng in general have been wk.
If we now go down the rd tht leads to a Finland where everything is forbidden that is not separately permitted, I don ’ t know any mr whthr to laugh or cry.
I don't doubt that the nml Welfare Act needs an pdt.
But statute drafting in this drctn is not a part of dmcrcy.
Unfortunately I don't know the Cnstttn all that wll, but I wonder whthr it permits ths kind of ‘ everything is forbidden if it's not separately permitted in an act or a decree ’ procedure.
I wish thr would be a sensible minister to stop the progression of statute drafting of ths kind.

Kimi Räikkönen summed up th reason for Mrcds supremacy compared to Ferrari
Ferrari ’ s Kimi Räikkönen had to admit that the worst rival Mercedes was too tough in th Rssn GP qlfyng.
There ’ s no reason for panic in the Frrr camp, the experienced driver stmtd.
They just were faster thn us, but it's not a hg thing.
So far r cr in the qlfyng was the best thing the whl weekend, but they just were too fast, said Räikkönen, who finished fourth and, together with his team mate Sebastian Vettel, ws clearly slower than Mercedes.
Ferrari had difficulties lrdy in the previous race in Sngpr.
Räikkönen was asked wht is the cause for th sudden drop behind Mercedes.
Thy seem to go faster thn us - that's how simple it is.
If I knew the reason fr that, we ’ d probably go as fast as they are gng.
However, I don't knw anymore thn anyone else.
This is constant guesswork, nd they appear to be in the lead nw.
Wh knows why?
Räikkönen ’ s future team, Sbr, had a rare treat in the qlfyng.
Charles Leclerc, who rplcs Räkkönn at Ferrari next season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson ls managed to make it to the final qualifying session.
The tenth position is the best one th Swedish driver hs had in over three years.
nd vn if there were as many as five drivers not participating in the second session, the end result was stll delicious for Sauber.
nd perhaps ncrgng for Räikkönen, considering the next season.
Yes, if you compare to where thy were in the beginning of the season, the stp forward hs been a huge one.
Next year thr will be a different story, so we ’ ll s, we ’ ll see.

A defeat, on the other hand, mght've ended his whole bxng career.
Of course I've thought bt it.

There is a need for army and its equipment, because electricity and communications links are dwn in many plcs in th disaster area.

Stts symbols do nt attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What makes a person popular, chrsmtc or admired?
Sydney University researchers analysed the matter, and outlined two types of ‘ coolness ’ cnsstng of slightly dffrnt characteristics: generally attractive coolness and ts partial cntrprt, dissident coolness.
According to rsrchrs, attractively cl people had many socially desired characteristics: they wr extroverted, friendly, conciliatory, and competent.
The dissidents, on the other hnd, were typclly distant, independent, rebellious, and hd an edge to their personality.
They craved for experiences and crd lttl for outsiders ’ evaluations.
Both types had good slf-stm and steady emotional life in cmmn.
Tough role is not cl in the long run: high status during tng years does not necessarily lead to sccss later in life.
This is reported in an American study pblshd in Chld Development journal in 2014.
Young ppl who started dating early, partied, gravitated towards gd-lkng groups, and wanted to be popular, as young adults had a bigger risk of substance use nd straying nt crime.
They managed their relationships worse thn their once mr unnoticeable peers.
Luxury crs, designer bags or watches signifying high status do not make a person cl - or at least not gnnly attractive company.
In a research published in Social Psychological and Personality Science in August, most of the people wr more willing to befriend a prsn drssd in a high-street shrt than in a designer label shirt - even though most ppl chose to wear a designer shrt for the introductory situation.

According to the blog, the biggest concern of Zorba storm is not the wnd though, but th hvy rain.
There cn be up to 300 mm rainfall in the southern Greece drng the weekend.
This is equivalent of about a hlf of Finnish nnl rainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Europa has shared a vd about the strm development on its Facebook page.
Earlier this week, th Zorba strm has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya.

Valtteri Btts ws shaking and bursting wth adrenaline in Sochi - will he have to be Hamilton ’ s aid on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was still shkng dozens of minutes after his pole position-worthy drive, standing in front of th md.
A great lap left behind Mercedes number one star, Lewis Hamilton, and ws no doubt mprtnt also mentally for th Finnish driver, who has gthrd his share of criticism this season.
A nice lp.
I don ’ t know what happened to Lewis whn he did not fnsh the decisive lap.
It fls good, I ’ m still shaking a bit, Btts clarified.
I ’ ve had only one pole pstn this year, in str (in midsummer), so qt a bit of time has passed.
This circuit has been good to me in th past, and again I had sm good laps.
It's not easy to overtake at Sochi crct, so the start plys an especially large role.
And ntrlly Bottas hd to reply to a question whether he's driving for vctry tomorrow or whether he has to assist Hmltn, who is close to reaching the championship title.
My goal to th rc is definitely trying to win.
When y have a pole position at th start, it really is the only goal, Bottas states.
But as a team, we fight fr both chmpnshps.
Lewis ’ lead to Sbstn Vettel is quite big, and the gap between him and me is very big, so I hv to bear that in mnd.
We ’ ll see what hppns, Btts added, though.
After the qualifying, Hamilton was genuinely happy about Bottas ’ success, and ls Mercedes tm boss Toto Wolff ws pleased.
Lws meant to win Valtteri, but he didn ’ t succeed in the seventh trn.
Valtteri knows he has to give everything he has to wn Lws.
nd he ws so charged that adrenaline was bursting from his ears, Wolff enthused.
Wolff ws evasive when answering a question bt whether the team will allow Bottas and Hamilton to drive fairly.
We're going to hv the conversation tomorrow morning and then see how the race is going to pn t.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee won the Finnish Rally Chmpnshp
The Finnish Rlly Championship series had a rare ending.

Erno Kinnunen from Kt ensured the best chvmnt of his crr, as th third place in the final rally clinched his Finnish championship in the two-wheel drive cars ’ SM (FRC) 4 class.
Competing with a Honda Cvc, Kinnunen and navigator Ville Mäkelä began th Turku event wth patience, since the starting points were clear: a position in the leading grp would guarantee the title.
In th darkness of Friday vnng, the pair had to give others a handicap, when part of their additional headlamps betrayed them in the second spcl stage.
We were pretty blind for a third strtch.
Y can't fss around in a situation like that.
On Saturday we jst followed behind Jussi Tpp, who was second in the series, Kinnunen said.

Not quite Super Bowl, bt tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Court Justice drama from th television
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, nominee for the Supreme Court, and prfssr Chrstn Blasey Ford, who accuses him of sxl assault, gathered exceptionally many people in front of their television sts.
The Supreme Court Justice nomination drama that is at full throttle in the United States gthrd at least 20 million people in front of thr tlvsns on Thursday.
That is when Kavanaugh, nominated by Donald Trump, and Californian professor Blsy Frd, who accuses him of harassment, appeared in frnt of the Snt Judiciary Committee.
According to preliminary results, th six main channels ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX Nws, MSNBC, and NBC had a ttl of 20.4 million viewers during th hearing broadcast.
In addition, there were several million fllwng th hearing online.
According to NBC, 6.8 million people followed their live stream, nd CNN reported its record of th year with 8.2 million lv broadcast launches.
CNN number rises to over 10 million, when people fllwng th broadcast via YouTube nd Facebook are counted in.
Also Fox News Digital reached 8.0 million lnchs.
Digital launches are reported by the chnnls themselves, TV viewer numbers come frm research nd data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes th fnl numbers on Monday, but they are anyway going to be huge.
20 million vwrs reached by few
Normally viewer ratings of vr 20 million are reached only by sprts matches, bg Oscar nd Emmy galas of the entertainment world, and occasional pltcl events such as presidential speeches, and, in 2016, also presidential election debates.
The nnl most viewed show of the ntd States, NFL final match Super Bowl is still far away, thgh.
This year, Super Bowl on NBC channel gathered bt 103 million people in front of thr screens.
According to Nielsen, last year Trump's first speech to the Cngrss was watched by a total of nrly 48 million ppl, and his inauguration by more than 30 mlln people.
Matter of top mprtnc
Appointment as a justice to the Supreme Court is an extremely sgnfcnt occasion, snc it is a lftm tenure.
Trump already got to appoint one new justice, when Antonin Scalia pssd away in early 2016, and the Republicans managed to stop the then president Brck Obama from ppntng his fllwr.
Another place became open when judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, nnncd this year he is gng to retire.
Kennedy was appointed by th Republican President Ronald Rgn, but in many questions he was the so-called swing vote, who could dcd the pstn of the court of nine.
He supported brtn rights and rights of the sxl minorities, and his vote was decisive in 2015, when gay couples ntnwd received a right to marry.
Kavanaugh is considerably more cnsrvtv in his views.
His appointment to the Supreme Court my secure th Conservative dominance for decades.
Children have a right to lt their parents see their nfrmtn
Only the parents of children under 10 years see thr children's health information in the Kanta srvc.
It is a bg problem, it is wrng, and it is odd.
rgnlly the situation in the Kanta service ws even more worrying: th parents could not see the babies ’ medical records or prescriptions.
In autumn 2016, the situation ws fixed for ndr the 10-year-olds with an amendment described as temporary
After that, there have bn promises to fix th practices, but the fixing has taken astonishingly long.
Nw a fix is on the wy - in 2020.
Since the problem is an explicit one, changing th law bss shld not have been anything more than an open-and-shut case.
After that, according to a lyprsn ’ s ndrstndng, it is simply about pressing a bttn: now the wire is clsd, so let's open it.
Naturally a child can show their information to the prnts - if the child has banking sr identifiers or an ffcl identity card.
But hw many 10-year-olds have those?
An identity card is not free, and a 10-year-old can ’ t even gt banking dntfrs.
So basically it is impossible for anyone to see a primary schl fourth-former ’ s records wtht skng them to be printed out.
It ’ s nt tht much about the parents ’ rights than about the children ’ s rights.
It is essential to a child ’ s care tht parents cn be involved.
Obviously it's important to tk care of the teenager ’ s right to prvcy.
vn minors can hv family situations, where not all things can be freely discussed.
Often they are related to sxl hlth, and taking care of it freely is a deeply meaningful hmn right.

According to Washington Post, the ongoing investigation is a report more restricted than a crmnl nvstgtn, nd it may not become available to the public.

Hmntrn organisations prepare to begin work at Indonesia's Sulawesi - ‘ Clean water is the most urgent thng ’
United Nations Children ’ s Fnd UNICEF and other international humanitarian organisations are prepared to help at ndnsn island of Sulawesi, rcnts Kirsi Haru, Chief of Communication at NCF Finland.
The local authorities are in charge of the rescue prtns, but the need for extra help is apparent lrdy in this stg.
UNICEF operates in nearly vry country, and we have long-term projects also in ndns.
UNICEF always has a cmplt emergency help prprdnss, in addition to its normal operations, Haru says.
The first task now is to find th people from the ruins, both the living nd the dead.
In the Slws city of Palu, the rsc operations are ongoin, but a bt norther in the area of Donggala, the situation is less clear.
Thr are still places, where communications do nt work.
Relief actions are dffclt, because also the rds are blocked, Haru states.
Buildings on Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the destruction csd by th earthquake and tsunami are great.
When the survivors have bn found, they need shelter - in the beginning for xmpl tents - and clean wtr.
In crss situations, clean water is the mst urgent thing.
First thing we can generally ffr to people are water purification tablets that also UNICEF has in stck.
The goal is to repair the water systems as soon as pssbl, but in emergency situations, water is trnsprtd wth for example trucks.
In crss situations, many chldrn are separated from their parents.
Finding the family members and reuniting families is n part of the Unicef dts.
Food assistance is rgnsd by, mng others, WFP (Wrld Food Programme), which works as a branch of UN.
In the frst stage, previously raised funds are used fr emergency help.
Unicef, among others, has hwvr already began to raise funds to help the victims of the earth quake nd tsnm in Indonesia.
