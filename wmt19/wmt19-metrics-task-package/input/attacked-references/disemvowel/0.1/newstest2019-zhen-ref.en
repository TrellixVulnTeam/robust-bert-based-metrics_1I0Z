According to th UK media, dmrl William Moran, the deputy director of Naval Operations, said that vn thgh the US Navy ws reinvigorating to cope with the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the ntd Stts would continue to take the Asia-Pacific region as the focus of its navy--the Pentagon had expanded the scope of Asia-Pacific region to include the Indian Ocean - s - the Pacific.
According to the reports frm the site of "Jane's Defence Weekly" on Sptmbr 24, China and Russia wr classified as the strategic competitors in th nw national defense strategy, which was announced by the United States at the beginning of the year.
Thn, the US Navy recommissioned the Second Flt to stand up against the Russian activities more directly.
It was reported that these actions rsd some doubts and concerns among its allies and nlysts . They were frd that the US Navy might go far wy from the strategy of "Rebalancing toward Asia-Pacific", which marked the Obama dmnstrtn.
However, Admiral Wllm Mrn said that the focus of the US Navy wld still focus on the West Pacific.
At the rnd-tbl discussion, which ws hosted by National Br of Asian Research in Washington on January 24, 2018, he said: "For us, there are any significant chngs. "
Moran said: "The focus remains on rebalancing, shifting fcs or whatever you wnt to describe it. "
But he admitted that th United States kept close rltns with Europe.
He said: "We wld continue to focus on the growth of th West Coast. "
Although he pntd out that the overall policy about Russia fell within the trms of reference of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warned: "The Russians might face the demographic and cnmc chllngs, bt the history demonstrates tht they will become very tough if we have a conflict with them. "
Admiral Moran said that as a prt of the comeback action to fight against Russia, China nd other competitors, the US Navy was dynamically deploying the trps nt a "new campaign mode". This would help to mk the opponents unaware unprepared for the deployments of the American aircraft carrier battle group or thr assets at any specified tm and place.
He said: "Our Nvy and Marine Corps support it--the concept of nprdctbl battle . We should nt show up at the same place again and again like clockwork .--Ths is our approach. "
It was reported that the first to try this new approach ws the "Hrry Truman" rcrft carrier battle grp, and ts early deployment included the working visits to ports and the patrols in areas, where it usually only passed.
Moran said that the US Navy ws currently tryng to ensure its allies to know that these wrshps would still patrol in th traditional areas, and solving the logistical problems and family liaison problems for new deployment process.
Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, the Commander of Royal Australian Navy, also delivered a speech in ths event to indicate that the Australian rmy could smlssly cooperate with the mrcn aircraft carrier battle group.

People ’ s Daily Online, Beijing, Nvmbr 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) - In the current tide of "mass entrepreneurship and innovation", mr and mr technology companies have begun to pay ttntn to patent R & D nd related protection work, and dply explore the potential value of patents to occupy the mrkt domination.
Similarly, many technology companies have encountered numerous nfrngmnts crisis in patent technology lcnsng and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zhanghong nd Lai Bn from Guangdong Province, on the grounds of patent infringement, appealed the developer of "Didi Chxng" APP, Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. (hrnftr rfrrd to as Xiaoju Technology), th operator, Didi Chuxing Technology C., Ltd. (hrnftr referred to as Didi Chxng), the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Information Services Limited (hereinafter referred to as Guangdong Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Crt.
The three plaintiffs rqstd th court to rdr that the three defendants immediately stopped the actions of manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, and using the plntff ’ s patent.
On October 30, 2018, China Judgment Online published the "First-instance Cvl Ruling Paper of Infringement of nvntn Patent Rights btwn Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.", whch disclosed some details of case in which the Didi Chxng APP ws sued for patent infringement.
The three plaintiffs believe that thy are the patentees and nvntrs of the "carpooling srvc system and method based on mobile terminals", and the whole operation process of the "ride-sharing" application in the "Didi Chuxing" APP corresponds to the tchncl solution of the patent protection involved in the case, which frmd a ptnt nfrngmnt.
However, during the court ’ s ruling, Xiaoju Technology believed tht Guangdong Pacific ws not an eligible defendant . It nly provided free downloads of the involved APP "Didi Chuxing" on the Internet, and did not implement the patent mthd involved . There ws no direct or indirect nfrngmnt behavior, and it should not be included as a defendant in ths case.
Scndly, the infringement of this case was nt in Guangdong.
According to th lw, the infringement of the patent involved should be the place where the patent method nvlvd in the case was completely mplmntd . Therefore, the jurisdiction of the court ws challenged and the case was requested to be transferred to the court of the defendant's domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Crt.
The Gngzh Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pacific provided the alleged infringement Didi Chuxing PP prdct on its online platform . It is not inappropriate for th plaintiff to list Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
And the defendant Guangdong Pacific ’ s domicile is located in Gngzh, under the jrsdctn of the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Crt.
Th defendant Xiaoju Technology advocated that the case be transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial with inadequate vdnc . Th Crt dismissed the defendant Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. ’ s objection to the jurisdiction of the case, nd ordered it assume the acceptance fee for the cs.
At present, the other trls of th case have not been announced, and the reporter will py close attention to the follow-up details of the patent nfrngmnt case of Didi Chuxing.
Exclusive Interview with CEO of the Cmmnwlth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: Australia-China Scnc and Tchnlgy Cooperation Achieved Remarkable Results
"China ’ s science and tchnlgy have developed rapidly in th past few dcds, and Australia and China can chv fruitful results by going forward hand in hand in the scientific field. "
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Rsrch Organization sd in an exclusive ntrvw with a reporter from the China News Service in Bjng, th cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology has shown great vitality from the cooperation in dealing with climate change to th "Eye of Hvn" project.
As th largest national research institution in the Cmmnwlth of Australia, CSR has achieved many world famous innovative research results in the fields of ocean, nrgy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSR has maintained close cprtn with scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
"This is a lasting friendship that nvlvs the trust of partners nd the tradition of long-term cooperation . ", Mrshll said.
In My of this yr, China ’ s Five-hundred-meter prtr Spherical radio Telescope ― Chn ’ s Eye of Heaven, installed the world ’ s first 19-beam L-band receiver.
This internationally mst advanced 19-beam feed source rcvr is jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that th successful development of the receiver is based on CSR ’ s many years of technical accumulation . Whn enabled, the FAST survey speed wll increase by 5 to 6 times, meanwhile mr scientific observation targets will be expanded.
"This is th contribution of CSIRO to FAST. "
In addition to the above cooperations, CSR is also working closely with Chns scientific research institutions in the construction of Square Kilometer Array radio telescope, rsrch and development of nw fuel technologies, energy conservation nd emission reduction.
"In the pst, scientific rsrchs often focused on problems after hndrds of yrs, and now more scientific research power is needed to solve the problems in front of them. "
Mrshll believed tht Australia and China are complementary in the field of scientific development, and both countries face a series of challenges in thr development progress.
For xmpl, extreme weather ccrs frqntly in the world . Drought and floods have led to a reduction in food production and food shortages hv seriously affected human development.
At the same time, ppltn xplsn, gng, chronic disease and other problems are also the serious challenges we faced.
"Th cooperation between Australia and China in recent years has focused on slvng these current problems. "
Marshall said tht the key job of Center for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research, jointly established by CSIRO and National Lbrtry fr Marine Scnc and Technology (Qingdao), are observing El Nino phenomenon and La Nina phenomenon, studying the relationships between these two phenomenons and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facilities for extreme wthr . The new species of crls developed by CSIRO and the Chinese cdmy of Scncs can overcome extreme weather and cn also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, technological innovation is dffclt to accomplish by nslf, it requires extremely high costs, and there are mny problems to be slvd, so cooperation is particularly important today. "
Marshall expressed that the closer the cooperation is, the more likely it is to make breakthroughs . This is also th significance of Australia and Chn in strengthening cooperation under the frmwrk of the "n Belt One Rd".
"Strengthening bltrl cooperation is mainly for cooperation in scnc and technology for us. "
Marshall took the example that CSIRO has rcntly developed a gold purification method without using cyanide . Because the traditional cyanide gold purification mthd is very harmful to the environment, many countries hp to find a way to purify gold wth little environmental plltn.
"We are vry willing to introduce this technology to China . This is one of the chvmnts of r participation in the "One Blt One Road" cooperation. "

Ri Yong Ho said on the United Nations General ssmbly that North Korea had taken "very kind actions" drng the lst year, including cessation of missile and nuclear tests, dismantling of nclr test sites and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weapons nd technologies
"However, we haven ’ t seen any corresponding rspns from th United States," he said.
"If the United States doesn ’ t trust on us, we have no cnfdnc in our national security . It is impossible for us to unilaterally abandon th nuclear weapons ndr sch circumstances. "
Although Ri Yong Ho repeated th complaints of North Korea about the opposition of United States to "phsd" dnclrztn, his speech ws of great significance because it did not completely refuse the unilateral denuclearization as Nrth Korea had before.
Ri Yong Ho mentioned th joint statement between Jeong-eun Km and Trump on June 12, and at that time Jeong-eun Km agreed to work towards the "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", whl Trump prmsd to protect the security of North Korea.
North Kr has always been seeking to formally end th 1950-53 Korean War, bt the United States said that North Korea must firstly abandon nuclear weapons.
The United States also refused to loose the requirements for th ntrntnl sanctions on North Korea.
"The United States insists on ‘ denuclearization first ’ and ncrss the pressure of sanctions to chv its goals in a hgh-prssr manner, and even refuses to issue the ‘ declaration of th end of th war ’," Ri Yong Ho said.
"The thought tht sanctions can make us kneel and beg frgvnss is the daydream of th people who don't know us.
Hwvr, the problem is that such cntnd sanctions are deepening our distrust. "
Ri Yong Ho dd not mention the scnd Trump-Kim summit plan mentioned by the US President earlier this wk at the United Nations.
On the contrary, he mphszd the thr meetings between Jng-n Kim and Moon Jae-in, th South Krn President over the past five months and said, "If the other side of denuclearization is South Korea, but not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Pnnsl will not become so deadlocked. "
China announced that it will reduce mprt trffs on 1,585 tax items from November 1, 2018.
Since this year, China has taken th initiative to reduce mprt tariffs.
On May 1 this year, the drug was fully tax-deducted, and all import tariffs for all 28 tx items of general txbl drgs, including ntcncr drugs, and lkld drugs with anticancer effects, and Chinese patent medicines with actual imports, were adjusted to zero.
At the same time, it hs ls greatly reduced th production and import links value-added tax burden of anti-cancer drugs.
On July 1, tax reductions were imposed on 218 tax tms of cars nd parts.
After the tax reduction, the fnshd automobile tax rt of Chn ’ s automobile has been lwr than the average level of developing countries, which is in line with the actual sttn of China ’ s automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive the restructuring of the ndstry and the optimal allocation of resources, cclrt th survival of the fttst to help improve th quality of products and services . It is expected to promote the adjustment of automobile prices to a crtn extent, so that consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, tx rdctns were imposed on 1449 tax items of daily consumer goods.
Th tx reduction on daily consumer goods is closely bound up with people ’ s need of better lives.
Ths time ’ s tax reduction not only involves lots of items but also hs strong dynamics, with an average tax rdctn of 56%.
The reduction of taxes on daily consumer goods directly benefits the consumers nd prmts the competitiveness of domestic industries.
November 1, tax reductions will be mpsd on 1585 industrial product tx items of electromechanical devices, parts nd raw materials.
Appropriately reducing the import tariffs of some domestically ndstrl products with rgnt needs can attract more foreign capital, help increase domestic effective supply, assist ndstrl upgrading, and cntrbt to enterprises allocate resources on a global scale, reduce production costs, and also bnft for reducing the prssr on the domestic environment.
Relevant person in charge of Customs Tariff Commissions Office of the State Council introduced that th above four times initiative tax reduction and the third step tx reduction implemented on ths year ’ s July 1 in accordance with the rslts of the xpnsn of the information tchnlgy agreement negotiation will result in the overall tariff level fell from lst year ’ s 9.8% to 7.5%.
The adjusted overall tariff level is slightly higher thn that of the EU, lower thn most dvlpng countries, at a moderately low level, and basically matches China ’ s developing cntry status and development stage.
According to the prsn in charge, as one of the important ndctrs of th degree of openness in China ’ s trade in goods sector, the overall level of trffs should be compatible with the stage of China ’ s economic development and rflct the characteristics of th times.
Chn ’ s trade in goods scale ranks first in the wrld, and it has already had the economic foundation to frthr expand its openness . However, there is still a gap between the quality nd efficiency of trade development compared with developed cnms . Therefore, the vrll level of tariffs should be appropriately lowered.
Tariff is a kind of protect means fr cmplnc . Th level of tariff should be compatible with industrial competitiveness to encourage healthy competition . Whl overprotection goes against the industry development and quality improvement.
Tariff rate djstmnt mst balance production needs with consumer demands.
Fcs on reducing the commodity tax rate tht has a large domestic demand nd contributes to the transformation and upgrading of the ndstry, nd striving to increase the import of chrctrstc advantage prdcts with relatively concentrated needs of the people, continuously improving the sense of gain of enterprises and the public, and meeting the upgrading needs of the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The tax reduction should balance the fnncl revenue nd the affordability of industrial development.
In the choice of spcfc tax-reduction commodities and rng of tax reductions, we mst plan and coordinate the dmstc and international markets, th upstream and downstream aspects, production and consumption relationship, and maintain the steady development of China ’ s economy.
The principal stressed that this year is th 40th anniversary of reform and opening up . China ’ s initiative to reduce the overall level of import tariffs is a major measure based on China ’ s own nds to achieve high-quality development . It is conducive to the overall planning nd utilization of ntrntnl and foreign resources to prmt the quality of domestic supply systms and mt the pgrdng consumption needs of people.
This ctn and measure shws tfhat China will constantly pursue an opening up strategy of mutual benefit nd win-win result, firmly support economic globalization, steadfastly uphold the principle of fr trade rule and the multilateral trading system cntrd on the WTO, and continue to draw development momentum frm opening up to the world to also allow Chn ’ s development to better benefit the world.
Serbia announced to enter the tp defense readiness condition . Srbn President and Russian Prsdnt will meet to discuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
Yugoslav news agency reported by quoting sources frm th Office of Srbn Prsdnt that Vucic, the Serbian President, gave orders that the Serbian armed forces entered the top defense readiness condition in consideration of the fact that Ksv special troops had occupied the roadway to the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station ndr the control of Belgrade in nrthrn Kosovo.
On September 29, Vulin, the Dfns Minister of Serbia, nnncd that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness cndtn.
Vulin emphasized that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situation in Kosovo as long as Vucic's orders were still ffctv . Regardless of th direction in which the situation develops, the Srbn army will respond ccrdngly.
It was reported by the Tass news agency of Russia that Vucic said in an interview on September 29 that he had notified the United States, Russia, Europe nd other sides bt the current sttn, and wld visit Moscow on October 2 to meet with Putin, the Prsdnt of Russia, to sk Putin's support on th Kosovo issue.
When he ws asked whether Serbia needed to get the military support frm Russia like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I don't want a sgnfcnt military conflict in our trrtry. "
Vucic ls said that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness cndtn just for the sk of deterrence to prvnt the conflict . However, it was a clear warning: Serbia wld never tolerate any violent action in Kosovo.
The Serbian army upgraded the defense readiness cndtn in connection wth the two actions in Kosovo.
According to the statement of Serbia, the Albanian people were carrying out the mass rrsts of Serbian people, wh had been living thr for generations, in recent days, but ths arrested Serbian people didn't brk any laws.
Vcc said that since Marko Juric, the head of the Serbian government's Office fr Kosovo and Metohija, was beaten and detained by the Albanian rmy in Kosovo, the Albanian ppl constantly scltd the issues in the region and carried out the inhumane arrests and deportations of th Serbian people.
Furthermore, over 100 people, including the members of ROSU special army of th Dprtmnt of the Interior of the self-declared Republic of Kosovo, armed police, and snipers, occupied th battle field near the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydrpwr station, ntrd the ecological sport center near the dam in nrthrn Ksv, and blocked all roads nearby . These rs were originally under the control of Serbia.
Vucic ndctd tht Kosovo was encouraged by the western cntrs to make this military adventure . Since the Kosovo army had taken actions without ntfyng Serbia in advance, it violated th rules in Paragraph 1 in Chapter 9 of "Brussels Agreement", and it also breached the UN Security Council Rsltn 1244 and the military technology agreement between Srb and Kosovo.
Vucic had spoken to Stltnbrg, the NATO Secretary-General, to crtcz the western countries for thr false words on the Kosovo issue.
The source of current conflict was still th historical grievances lasting for hundreds of years between Serbian people nd Albanian ppl in Kosovo.
For the ownership of Ksv, Serbian people and Albanian people had dffrnt opinions.
Srb cnsdrd Kosovo as the birthplace of its ntn and th cradle of culture, bcs Serbia had built its most powerful cntry here in the 12th century . However, the Albanian people settled here in large numbers only after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbian army retreated to the north.
The Albanian ppl insisted that the Illyrian ppl of the primitive tribe located at Kosovo in the 4th-5th century were their ancestors . Therefore, Ksv had been the Albanian ppl's territory since ancient times.
The subjective pltcl divisions contributed to the sharp cnflcts between different nations, religions and cultures, rsltng in the fierce confrontation between Serbian people and lbnn people in Kosovo.
The Albanian people in Ksv first declared the ndpndnc of Albania in 1912.
After the Frst Wrld War, a large nmbr of Albanian people, who wr living in th Balkan Peninsula, moved to Turkey . Th proportion of Srbn people was relatively rising . The ctns of "taking back their own lands" in the sight of the Serbian people were considered as the predations of the "Greater Serbian Nationalism" by Albanian people . The contradiction between the two nations intensified.
Kosovo became the "pwdr keg" of Balkan.
The Albanian separatists in Kosovo liberation army and the Serbian army and plc engaged in armed conflicts in 1999, which led to the NATO troops bombed the Fdrl Rpblc of Yugoslavia consisting of Serbia and Montenegro . The Kosovo War brk t.
Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence frm Serbia on Fbrry 17, 2008.
Thereafter, th news came out that Serbia and Ksv would normalize relations, and sign a global and legally binding agreement . However, due to the historical grievances btwn the two nations and the geopolitical cnstrnts, they failed to sign th agreement, which was in the control of different frcs, including th United States, Europe and Russia.
Just a month ago, Vucic made it clear for the first tm that he insisted to separate Serbian people from lbnn people in Kosovo . It xpsd the conflict between th two nations again.

China News Service, Beijing, October 1 (reported by Yin Li)--A cloudless blue sky in the day and the red clouds at evening ...... Recently, Beijing kept in the mode of the most beautiful blue sky . Thousands of Beijing residents couldn't help to change tctcs to shw their pictures on social platforms and cnstntly make status updates to show their happinesses . Thy said tht "the mst beautiful skyline wth a bl sky and white clouds was the bst business card of Bjng".
Beijing had met the "blst sky" snc August.
It could be fnd anywhere in Bjng at any time that many residents were holding their smart phones or DSLR cameras to tk pictures.
On social platforms, sch as the microblog nd WeChat Moments, people could see th different beauty of the Imperial Palace, Tian An Mn, the Bird's Nest, Hutong, and various buildings against the blue sky in the net frnds' cameras.
Sm net frnds said that such "landscape pictures" were the best city images of Bjng; and some net friends joked that if the blue sky rmn the same for a long time, the patients with cervical spondylosis would srly be cured; some net friends even hoped that "the bl sky would last through the winter, sprng and smmr, providing Beijing with a blue sky across four seasons".
Why did the rsdnts in Beijing particularly lk to show the blue sky?
That's because they hd been suffering from the fog and haze in this city in the pst . They looked forward to the blue sky grly . After strtng the "Blue Sky Protection Cmpgn" in Beijing to continuously improve th air quality, there wr lss fog and haze, but more blue skies . The residents were joyful to see this . And they felt so happy with it.
The weather was fine in Beijing on Ntnl Day.
Mst of 35 air quality monitoring stations in Beijing showed in green at 8:00 am, indicating th "Superior First Grd".
The photography competition with th theme of the "bluest sky" vlntrly organized by the residents on social platforms was still ndr way.
Why was the sky so bl in Beijing recently?
As the relevant responsible person of Beijing Environmental Protection Agency explained, th mean cncntrtn of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 35 micrograms per cbc meter in Beijing in August of this year, whch created the best record for the same prd in hstry of the recent five years.
Th real-time concentration of PM2.5 ws even less than 10 in September.
The major factor contributing to the "bluest sky" was the overall fvrbl mtrlgcl conditions in recent days . And more mprtntly, Beijing hd persistently carried out the air pollution control . It had vigorously promoted th Clean Air Action Plan in the past five years, and the environmental benefits were released continuously resulting in the reduction of total pollutant emission in the rgn . These laid the fndtn for continuous improvement of air qlty.
Beijing released officially nd implemented the "2013-2017 Clean Air Action Plan in Bjng" in 2013.
According to this plan, th authority would continue to guide the llvtn of functions unrelated to its status as national capital, and promoted the works of clean nrgy substitutions nd pollutants discharge reductions . 4923 coal fired boilers wr eliminated in total.
Thus, Bjng became the first big city of achieving the fll network of natural gasification in the Chns mainland.
ccrdng to the dt, the annual concentration of PM2.5 in Beijing from 2013 to 2017 cumulatively dropped by 35.6%; th number of days tht the air quality reached the standards increased by 50; the number of days that achieved the Superior First Grade increased by 25; the number of days wth heavy pollution reduced by 35 in ttl, and the occurrence rate of heavy pollution sgnfcntly drppd.
With the continuous improvement of air quality, Beijing authority issued the "Three-year Action Plan of Beijing to Win the Blue Sky Protection Campaign" in September on the basis of the analysis of a new round of PM2.5 source . According to the crrnt gvrnnc phase and pollution characteristics, it focused on the mprtnt prevention and control rs including the trtmnt of dsl trcks, flying dsts, and volatile rgnc compounds, optimized and adjusted the transportation structure, industrial structure, energy structure and land-use strctr, strengthened the inter-regional prvntn and control, enhanced th delicacy management of cty, promoted the green development in an all-round way, and strived to keep the "bluest sky" prmnntly in Beijing . The sky would not "be precious", since it was rare . Let it return to be the background of people's photo album, bt nt the ldng role.

After aggressive treatment, the srvvl rate of premature infants of 29 weeks nd more gestation is 98% in China, which hs reached the level of developed cntrs.
CNS, Shanghai, September 30 (reported by Chen Jing and Luo Yanqian)--Children's National Medical Center nd Children's Hsptl of Fudan University disclosed on September 30 that it had introduced the Canadian advanced mthd in th leading "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in Chn".
The project result shwd that after ggrssv treatment, th survival rate of premature infants of 29 weeks and mr gestation was 98% in China, whch hd reached the level of developed countries . However, the srvvl rate of premature infants of minimum gestation and the survival rate of premature infants without complications still needed to be improved greatly.
During the past 20 yrs, the Chns government has been paying attention to the treatment of newborns.
Crrntly, the nfnt mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71‰, which is significantly lower than th national average lvl and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China" hs significantly improved the survival quality of premature infants through four yrs of unremitting ffrts.
Professor Cao Yun, the director of NICU of Children's Hsptl of Fdn University told the reporter that it was of great significance for the mprvmnt of premature infants' overall survival quality and population quality to pay attention to the reduction of premature infants' survival quality, reduce the cmplctn rates, improve the neurodevelopmental prognosis, and improve the overall tcm of baby patients while improving th srvvl rate of premature nfnts . It was an important problem of cncrn to the pediatric nd neonatal departments at home and brd, and it was also a critical issue in this project.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature nfnts in Chn" has ncldd tens of thsnds of cases of premature nfnts of 33 weeks and less gestation in China and hs contributed to 1/3 reduction of the mortality rate of premature infants of minimum gestation and small birth weight through fr years of unremitting efforts . At the same time, the severe complication rate of premature infants has been significantly reduced nd th survival quality of premature infants has been greatly improved.
Ths project hs established a set of complete, systmtc and effective collaborative quality improvement methods, which are suitable for our domestic conditions and will collaboratively improve the prognosis of premature infants and improve the level of neonatal cr by setting up the ntnl collaboration network of ntnl quality improvement, introducing the concepts of collaborative quality improvement, nd combing 25 cooperative hospitals in China.
Children's Hospital of Fudan nvrsty is connecting the forces of neonatal departments across the country, nd developing the guidelines fr the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project in order to provide rfrnc nd guidance for the standard dgnss and treatment of neonatal infections.

The EPIQ methods hv been widely applied to all NICUs in Canada, and have bn dptd by 6 other countries.
According to th pediatric hospital, th research results show that after implementing th EPIQ intervention for two years, the infection rt of premature infants will drop by 35%, and the usage rate of antibiotics will drp by 20%.
In the future, Chldrn's Hospital of Fudan University wll continue to promote and implement these methods in the whole country, mng at comprehensively reducing th occurrence rates of all complications in premature nfnts and improving the quality of treatment for newborns in China.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are dffrncs and inequalities in th level of treatment in various rgns in China.
According to Professor Cao Yun's introduction, the pdtrc hospital will play a ldng role as an mprtnt cnstrctn nt of Children's National Medical Center . This project covers Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Shaanxi and many other western prvncs, with the goal of gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal treatment thrght the country.

On September 30, on the eve of the 69th birthday of th Ppl's Republic of China, we shrd in the fifth Memorial Day . Xi Jinping and other Party and state ldrs came to the Tn'nmn Sqr to attend the ceremony for presenting flower baskets to the people's heroes.
At ths moment, please pay tribute to the heroes whrvr you are.
The Memorial Day is not nly for reviving, but also fr awakening.
Look bck the rich history, every martyr ’ s name represents a frsh life.
Thy also have fry youth, sincere love and caring families.
However, for the belief that "the doctrine we believe in is the trth of the universe", and for the prps to "spr the suffering of th nxt generation", they are willing to sacrifice everything.
"I would cry fr China in ch day of my life".
Through time nd space, the heroes set up spiritual signposts to guide the way frwrd.
"Where do you come from nd where do y go? "; "What knd of man you want to be? "; It's not hard to have the answers if y understand the heroes.
In memory of heroes, the most mprtnt thng is to build a "mnmnt of heroes" in the heart.
According to th incomplete statistics, since th revolutionary wartime, around 20 million martyrs have died heroically for national independence, liberation of the people and prsprty of th country.
Due to vrs reasons, mny martyrs don ’ t even leave their names.
Countless heroes and martyrs nrch ideals with blood, practice faith wth life . To remember their nms and inherit their spirit, is to protect the nation's root and sl.
This "mnmnt of heroes" cannot be stnd or damaged.
For some time, the historical nihilism, bsd entertainment and other ndrcrrnts emerge.
All sorts of actions that distort and disparage heroes nd mrtyrs, challenge just cnscnc, derange value judgments, nd cause the public indignation and vigilance of the whole society.
Heroes and martyrs cannot be desecrated, nd heroes cannot be frgttn.
We cannot lt actions that touch the bottom line drift . We must dr to show our sword and uphold th dignity of hrs with rule of law and justice.
On May 1, the law for the protection of hrs and mrtyrs came into force.
From the perspective of judicial practice, the verdict of some cases is to the satisfaction of the masses, which not only effectively maintains the glrs mg of heroes in accordance with th lw, but also releases the positive nrgy for respecting heroes and martyrs.
A nation with pursuits can nt live without heroes, and a country with dls can nt live without pioneers.
It has become a cmmn social consensus to recall th martyrs and call for heroes.
Currently, there are mllns of memorial facilities of various kinds in China, and more than 100 million people visit th martyrs' cemetery vry year.
The hearts of th people are the strongest footstones.
Let advocating heroes, defending heroes, learning from heroes and crng heroes prevail, nd let the spirit of heroes mrg into the national blood . The "monument of heroes" will stand firmly between sky and rth and deep in th hearts of the people.
Report of Reuters on September 28 in Brussels: The rpn Union took a nn-cnfrnttnl stance against Italy on Friday after Italy looked down upon EU demands and srprsd th market with a massive bdgt dfct plan . But if Italy stuck to a too bold goal, the EU might take a more radical stance.
The m of Italian rscptc government was that the budget deficit was qvlnt to 2.4% of gross domestic product (GDP) in the next three years, suggesting that there ws no debt reduction dspt deficit reduction requirements.
Moscovici, the executive committee member of economic affairs of the European Commission, said on Friday, "We r not ntrstd in the crisis between the rpn Commission nd Italy," he responded cautiously since th proposals nd sanctions of the European Commission might have little impact on Italy.
Th ffcls and diplomats of the European Commission still hoped that market forces would persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan before tly officially submitted it to the European Commission in md-ctbr.
After the government announced its plan, th euro fell to its lowest lvl in nearly two weeks on Friday, while the Italian bond ylds hit their highest level in three wks.
If the deficit goal remained unchanged before th deadline in October, the European Cmmssn mght vt the Italian draft budget, which has never been done to any country by the European Commission.

[Abstract] As of September 28, various regions have introduced and mplmntd, or ssd a document to publish to the public for msrs of free or reduced-price opening for 981 scenic spots (74 spots for free nd 907 spots fr price reduction). The prcs have been reduced in th scenic spots in Yunnan Stone Frst, the Dali Three Pagodas, the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, the Lijiang River in Guilin, Guangxi, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Zhngjj in Hunan, Terracotta Army in Shaanxi, Mount Sanqingshan in Jiangxi nd Kanas in Xnjng.
In order to implement the deployment of the decision of the Central Economic Working Conference and the Government Wrk Rprt, th National Development and Reform Commission issued the Guiding pnns on mprvng the Formation Mechanism of Ticket Prices in State-owned Scenic Spots and Reducing Ticket Prices in Key State-owned Scenic Spots (hrnftr referred to as the Gdng Opinions) on Jn 28, requiring to improve the formation mechanism of tckt prices in state-owned scenic spots in terms of reasonable definition of the composition of ticket pricing costs, nnvtv price management methods and strict implementation prcng procedures, to ensure to achieve remarkable results for rdcng the relatively hgh ticket prices in key state-owned scenic spots by the end of September.
Various regions have actively carried out work according to the dplymnt rqrmnts nd reduced a batch of key state-owned scenic spot ticket prices.
As of September 28, various regions hv introduced and implemented, or issued a dcmnt to publish to the public for measures of fr or reduced-price pnng for 981 scenic spots (74 spts fr free and 907 spots for price reduction). Among them, thr are 159 5A scenic spots and 534 4A scenic spots, wth a total of 693 and accounting for 70.6%.
Among 907 scnc spots which have reduced prices, the number of the ttrctns wth the decreasing amplitude of mr than 20% is 491, accounting for 54.3% and the nmbr of the attractions wth the decreasing amplitude of more than 30% is 214, accounting for 23.6%.

National wide film-free cotton n-st observation nd dscssn exchange activities experts walk into test fields, listen to the situation presentation from CAE Yu Shuxun academician team representative.
Chn News Srvc, Xnjng, Xayar, September 30 (Geng Dndn, Wang Xiaojun) - Located in the Xayar County of Xinjiang, the cotton plntd in film-free cotton planting test base has a breathtaking grwth . Compared with th flm cotton next to it, it is not inferior in any respect . A cluster of snow-white cotton competes "blooming" and is full of branches.
From September 27 to 28, the ntnwd flm-fr cotton on-site observation and discussion xchng activities were held in Xayar County, Xinjiang.
The rprtr learned at th bsrvtn meeting that the film-free cotton technology systm with "Chinese Cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the mn body has initially achieved the goal of film-free planting in cotton fields, reducing the pollution of the Xinjiang cotton fld film residue to the ecological nvrnmnt and raw cotton . And film-free cotton integrated technology ’ s research and dmnstrtn have achieved significant progresses.
Academician Yu Shxn, cdmcn of the Chinese Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the national mdrn agricultural industrial technology system ’ s cotton system, ntrdcd the grwth of film-free cotton for Zhou Gm, secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang A & F University.
"The comprehensive technology of the film-free cttn developed by us cn completely realize the cotton planting without the film, nd can completely solve the prblm of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting. "
Yu Shxn described, an academician of the Chns Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is Chn ’ s mst important cotton-producing region . According to the National Bureau of Statistics, th cttn planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million mu, accounting fr 61% of the national cotton area.
Since the introduction of mulching flm in China in 1982, the filmed area of various types of crops in Xinjiang hs reached more than 50 million mu, nd the annual s of mulching film is bt 30 million tons.
Among them, cttn mulching film coverage rate reached 100%, and cotton field mulching film accounted for about 60% of Xnjng flm use.
Use film-free cotton for production msrmnt, nd the cotton output can be fully realized from 320 kg to 350 kg pr mu.
With the increasing mnt of mulching film input in Xinjiang, the residual flm recovery rate is low, the residual film volume in the sl is gradually ncrsd, and the soil structure damages and other problems caused by residual flm seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution to the sl, bt also has a great influence on th quality of cotton fiber.
Currently, more than one-third of th cotton fields in Xinjiang have chvd mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang mchnzd hrvstng area is about 14 million mu.
In the process of cotton mchnzd harvesting, a large amount of brkn film on earth surface and the cotton plant are picked up . Th broken film doped in the rw cotton is difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton, and cn not be cmpltly removed in th subsequent textile processing process, seriously affecting the quality of textile products.
On September 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange ctvts were hld in Xayar County, Xnjng.
In rdr to solve th cotton mulching film pollution, simplify the cotton planting technology and improve th cotton field efficiency, Yu Shuxun led hs team to use 8 years to implement the "Chns Cotton 619" film-free cotton technology planting, adding "dvntgs" to Xinjiang ’ s agricultural green development.
Yu Shuxun introduced, with the new idea of innovative breeding, they cultivate a nw line of extra early ripening, saline-alkaline tolerance, low tmprtr resistant, nd high yield plnd cotton "Chinese Cotton 619".
"‘ Chinese Cotton 619 ’ has achieved a series of supporting measures such as film-free sdng machinery, improved sdng depth, shallow buried in drip irrigation zone, suitable seeding density screening, and rsnbl chemical regulation under th condition of film-free cultivation in southern Xnjng. "
At present, Aksu, Korla, lr and other places have established a demonstration base for flm-fr cttn, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Film-free cotton planting has achieved high yield, cst savings, environmental protection nd improved overall benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at the Third Division of the Agricultural Science Rsrch Institute of Xnjng Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearly six years of rsrch and demonstration of flm-fr cotton cultivation techniques, the production of film-free cttnsd cotton can fully achieve 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, nd may vn be higher.
"The promotion of film-free cttn cultivation technology hs great prospects. "
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, the film-free cotton cultivation technology can completely solve the problem of soil residual flm pollution, but there is still a certain gap between th crrnt economic benefits nd th cultivation of mulching film.
"The support of cttn purchasing price will be conducive to future prmtn. "
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team will cntn to conduct in-depth rsrch and large-scale promotion and application of the film-free cotton, making the industry of flm-fr cotton larger and strngr, nd completely solving the problem of soil pollution csd by the film.

In th morning of October 1, in order to clbrt the 69th anniversary of th founding of the People's Republic of China, the Hng Kong SAR Government held a grand flag-raising ceremony at the Golden Bauhinia Sqr.
According to the statistics of the Immigration Cntrl Point, as of September 30, th number of passengers ntrng Hong Kng via the West Kowloon station of the high-speed railway have exceeded 300,000.
At the very time of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the Ppl's Republic of Chn, the West Kowloon boundary checkpoint predicts a peak of vstrs to Hong Kng on October 1 and 2.
Th reporter saw at the arrival lobby around 7:00 a.m. on October 1 tht many mainland tourists took dvntg of the National Day Golden Week, to take the high-speed rail and visit Hong Kng.
Mrs Song with light-footedness told the reporter that the National Day hldy was a rare long hldy in a year . It has always been her wish to cm to the Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong to wtch the flag-raising ceremony . She felt very hppy and excited to be able to accomplish this will on Ntnl Day.
But currently, the flights between Ningxia nd Hong Kong are inconvenient . Thanks to the opening of the high-speed rlwy for the Hng Kong segment . Mr Sng checked the train schedule and found that the first trn could rrv at 7:03 a.m., and it was perfect timing for taking urban transportation means to the Gldn Bauhinia Square.
He told the reporters, "the high-speed railway is very cnvnnt, fast nd on time! "
The 70 daily one-hour short-haul trains rnnng between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North, Futian and West Kowloon greatly fclttd the residents in Guangdong-Hong Kng-Mc Grtr Bay Area to visit Hong Kong.
After arriving in Hong Kong, Mr Liu, who lived in Shenzhen, ws preparing to join hs Hong Kng friends at th top of a hill in Central.

The cstms clearance was convenient and the time was rdcd by half . She ws more impressed by th trip in Hong Kong segment . Sh told th reporter, "it seems like taking the sbwy, which is very fast .

A few minutes later, the trn entered the Hong Kong segment of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link . This was the first formally operated high-speed train in the Hong Kong segment.
The Hong Kong segment of the high-speed railway, which integrates the national 25,000-klmtr hgh-spd rail network and reaches 38 long-distance stations throughout the country, also welcomes mainland tourists from different provinces fr apart frm each other.
Mr Gao, wh took advantage of minor vacation to visit relatives in Hong Kong from Changsha, told the reporter that previously, th high-speed railway could only travel to Shenzhen Nrth, and he needed to take the subway to pass through Hong Kong, and thn take urban transportation means . It was trblsm and time-consuming to make transfers . Now, he can travel directly to the cntr of Kowloon nd have lunch which was made by his children when getting hm . He flt very hppy.
He said that the "one port and tw immigration inspection" customs clearance procedure were vry convenient beyond imagination, and "pssng both customs within 10 minutes. "
The West Kowloon Station, which is cls to the Airport Express and connects land and air traffic, has also become th preferred destination for many trnst passengers.
Miss Wu, from Fujian Province, prepared to spnd th Golden Week with hr frnds traveling frm Hong Kong to Philippines .

Rprt of Reuters on September 28 in Washington/Mexico: Mexico sd on Friday that after days of debates, the U.S. President Trump's government and Canada were making rl efforts to resolve trade policy dffrncs, raising hopes that the Nrth American Free Trd Agreement (NAFTA) would maintain the form of a tripartite agreement.
Dspt lack of details, the obvious progress mentioned above is enough to prmpt the Mxcn and American governments to abruptly stop publishing the text of the two-party trd agreement and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the Mexican president-elect, told the rprtrs in Mexico that the U.S. government had md new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said he wld cntn to urge these three countries to prtcpt in NAFTA.
Ildefonso Guajardo, the Mxcn Mnstr of cnmc Affairs, said the time fr submitting the text of the US-Mexico trade agreement to the legislation dprtmnts of Mexico and the United States had bn delayed because the Canadian and American governments tried to reach an agreement "very seriously".
Guajardo said, "In the next 48 hrs, we will know whether we will gt a text of a tripartite grmnt or have to publish the text of the two-party grmnt. "
Guajardo sd that the officials at the same level in the .S. and Cnd had "special requests" to postpone to publish the text.

Officials of the Prime Minister's Office nd the Office of Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to requests for cmmnt on the cntr-prpsl.
According to foreign md reports, it was hard for people to find anything unusual in two little lions plyng in a conservation center lctd in th suburb in Pretoria, the cptl of South Africa, but they were absolutely unique.
University of Pretoria announced: "Thy r the first lions in the history, which are brn by artificial nsmntn--the first pair of lions in the world. "
The scientists of the nvrsty were committing themselves to studying the reproductive system of fml African lions.
Ganswindt, the director of Mammal Institute of nvrsty of Pretoria, said that these two little lions born on August 25 were a female lion and a male lion . Thy were prtty healthy and quite nrml.
After the intensive tests in 18 mnths, his tm finally made this breakthrough.
Ganswindt said in a media ntrvw: "We collected the sperms frm a healthy male lion. "
Next, the researchers waited for the hormones in the fml lion to rch a proper level so as to conduct the rtfcl insemination in it.
Ganswindt sd: "Fortunately, the rslt turned out to be successful. "
He sd that th researchers "tried many times, bt to their surprise, it didn't take much effort".
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthrough could be verified rptdly, and th scientists hoped to use this technology to save the endangered bg cats.
The International Union fr Conservation of Nature indicated that the lion had lrdy become extinct in 26 African countries, nd the total number of survival wild lions had dclnd sharply by 43% in the pst 20 years with only about 20,000 wild lions left.
Th African lion was lstd as vulnerable by this organization.
Ganswindt said: "Ths animal will be in danger of extinction if we do nothing for thm. "
He said that wth this kind of new technology, it's not necessary for the lions to be fed . The sprms could be njctd into the bodies of female lions, just like the pprch adopting on the lphnts in captivity in North America and Europe.
The exports of South Korea fll th most in more than two years in September, but analysts put the blame of the decline on fewer working days and said tht although the trade tension between China nd the United Stts rose, the global demand for South Korean gds remained strong.
Indeed, the average daily exports of Sth Kr increased last month.
Mrvr, the initial value data released rlr shwd that the exports in first weeks of September during the long vacation had a double-digit increase.
The year-on-year drop of Sth Korean exports in Sptmbr was the largest since July 2016, which ws more than the decrease of 5.7% estimated by 11 nlysts of Reuters surveys.
The initial value released on Monday showed that the amount of xprts in September was $50.6 blln, lwr than $51.2 billion in August.
Although th China-US trd disputes with intensifying concerns might cause other neighboring countries of China which depended on exports to suffer, Korean exports to China in September increased by 7.8%, expanding fr the 23rd cnsctv month.
Since the sales of oil prdcts declined, Krn exports to America decreased by 11.8%.
Although the market worried that the so-called "supercycle" of chips mght reach the pk, the overseas sales of Korean mmry chips and l products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively.
"However, the influence of trade conflicts cannot be avoided, because Korean xprts cnsdrbly depend on American and Chinese mrkts. "
The imports dcrsd by 2.1% to $40.8 billion, inferior to the ncrs of 3.1% estimated by the Rtrs survey.
The initial value of trd srpls in September was $9.7 blln, higher than $6.9 billion in August.
The Department of Industry said tht thanks to America and the EU countries, the global manufacturing would maintain bynt, which was a favorable factor for Korean xprts.
The sttmnt pointed out, "the increasing export prc caused by the rise of the oil price wll be beneficial to the xprts in the second half of this year. "
"However, the trade conflict between the United States and China continues and th market fluctuation after rising .S. ntrst rates intensifies, which r both negative pressure on exports. "
The average exports of each working day in September increased to $2.6 blln, while the mnt in August ws $2.1 billion.
The Mid-Autumn Festival in South Korea this year was from September 24-26 so tht there were only 19.5 working days in September, four dys less thn the same period lst year.
The Krn exports from January to September increased by 4.7% compared with that of the same prd last yr.
According to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, activities of Krn manufacturing rose again in September which was supported by dmstc orders, snc Chinese and Japanese rdrs declined, which would probably cast a shadow over export prospects.
North Korean media criticized the United States fr nt easing the sanctions on North Korea.
North Korea's "Rodong Shinmun" published a signatured review article on Sptmbr 30 to criticize the United States fr not easing the sanctions on North Kr while seeking to hv a dialogue with North Korea . The article sd that it was a "self-contradictory" action.
The article said that Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, indicated on September 14 that "the key to achieve the denuclearization of th Korean Peninsula was to impose the snctns on Nrth Korea" to emphasize that the United States wld keep its position on mplmntng th UN resolution to impose sanctions.
In the North Korea-US Jnt Statement of Singapore, the two sides promised to build a new North Korea-US relation, which complied with th two peoples' wshs of looking forward to peace nd prosperity.
On one sd, the United Stts increased the intensity of sanctions, but on the thr side, it skd for the dialogue . Undoubtedly, its actions were self-contradictory.
According to the article, if it wntd to build a new North Korea-US relation, establish a permanently cnsldtd system of pc in the Korean Peninsula, and achieve the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it would put building trust in th first place, start from wht can be done, and slv the problems by stgs.
The article ls said that the United States shld understand that it wldn't work to impose sanctions on North Korea.

EU may Reach Crude Oil Prchs Agreement with Iran
The US government announced that it will restart a new round of sanctions gnst Iran in November and even rg other countries to reduce mprts of Iran oil.
However, the mrcn allies dd not seem to take the advice.
According to the US "New York Times", on 29th, during the interview, Zarif, Foreign Minister of Iran, rvld tht although the United States threatened to sanction any cntry that does business with rn, Tehran is pprchng to reach an agreement on the sale of crude oil wth EU.
The core purpose of this agreement is to try to establish a nw payment mchnsm, which is to replace th dollar transaction in the form of brtr or domestic currency.
The purpose of this approach is to bypass the United States nd prevent th United Stts from impeding financial transfers.
Meanwhile, although the EU is working on facilitating the agreement, some French nd British officials are ls worried that if the agreement is concluded, it will be the most vrt confrontation between the EU and th United States gnst th US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
The US media sd that in the one hr interview, Zarif ’ s words sounded more ptmstc than in recent months.
Because the agreement can "strip" the traditional American lls and effectively break the US ’ s ttmpts to cut Iran ’ s ncm.
"This can guarantee that we cn sell oil and obtain bnfts", Zarif believed . According to the agreement reached in 2015, each country has th lgl rights to make trade contacts with Iran.
The head of nn for Foreign Affairs Policy, Federica Mghrn, also said rcntly that "no sovereign state or rgnztn can accept other people to decide who they can trade with. "
However, sh also predicted that before the US government carried out the next step of snctns in November, US leaders could adopt a series of financial nstrmnts aimed at banks, businessmen and cntrs that hv commercial intercourses with Tehran.
In May of this year, th US government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the grounds tht the agreement had deficiencies, saying that the agreement could nt prmnntly prohibit Iran from producing nclr fuel.
Th US then threatened to ban companies that buy Iran oil nd other commodities frm doing business in the United States.
This threat forced some companies to leave Tehran nd made the rnn currency dropped sharply.
Companies such as Airbus S.A.S . and French oil gnt Ttl have cancelled billions of dollars in nvstmnt in Iran.
British and French ffcls sd, the US government may "take the lead".
nsrprsngly, according to a recent report by the Trksh media, the US sanctions did not seem to have a major mpct on Iran ’ s oil exports.
Recently, Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh disclosed tht no country other than South Korea hs stopped buying Iran oil.
Both Zarif and Iran President Rhn believed that the purpose of a series of US ctns is to "seduce" Iran ’ s breach of the grmnt.
Zarif also regarded the US serial blast as not worthy of consideration . When asked if the US would vrthrw th current rnn government wth increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed . "It is a regime chng strategy, and this is th true purpose of the US. "

The overweight, obesity and blnd wght reduction were harmful to health.
The hlth hazard behind th "chubby children" couldn't be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, the head of National nsttt for Nutrition nd Health of Chinese Center for Disease Control nd Prevention, said that overweight-obesity could harm th adolescents' normal growth and development, have a negative impact on their mentality, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even cause hypertension, hyprglycm and hyperlipidemia in chldrn.
And th dlscnts' overweight-obesity might continue into adulthood, which would increase th dlscnts' risk of having chronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes in their adulthood.

The dlscnts should tk the periodic physical examination to monitor the growth and development index, such as height nd weight, so that the problems of vrwght and obesity could be discovered early and determined scientifically to tk intervention measures in time.
For those adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Ding Gangqiang dvsd that starvation therapy or semi-starvation therapy shld be vdd to control and lose weight in addition to th active and scientific arrangement of diet and movement since the adolescents are in a special physiological stage . They should not take drgs blindly to ls weight.

The "Classification Cntrl" scheduling principle of ship passing dam was added in the "Scheduling Regulation". The priority of ship passing dm would be determined according to the functional localization of navigation lock and ship lft respectively .

Signed nd pprvd by Prmr Li Keqiang, the State Council printed and dstrbtd the "Decision of the State Council on Further Reducing the Categories in the Catalogue of Industrial Products Subject to Production License Administration and Simplifying th Approval Procedures".
The "Dcsn" proposed to further reduce the categories in th catalogue of industrial products subject to production lcns dmnstrtn, cancel the production license administration for 14 ndstrl products, and delegate the administration authority for production licenses of 4 typs of industrial products to the quality and technical supervision departments of provincial people ’ s governments.
After this reform, the products that implement the industrial product production lcnss administration will be reduced from last yr ’ s 38 ctgrs to the current 24 categories.
The "Decision" clearly simplifies the approval prcss for prdcts in the catalogue.
First, the pre-certification product nspctn organized by the issuing authority is chngd to the product inspection cnfrmty report issued by the qualified nspctn and testing institution when the enterprise applies.
Second, in addition to dangerous chemicals, the products that have been licensed by th quality and technical supervision dprtmnt (market supervision and management department) of th provincial ppl ’ s government shall be subject to post-site inspection . After the ntrprs submits the application and product nspctn conformity report nd makes a commitment to ensure product quality and safety, the production license can be obtained after pssng the formal examination, and thn the on-site examination is accepted within the specified time.
Thrd, for ntrprss produce different types of products in the production and operation catalogue, in accordance with the principle of "one ntrprs, one license", when pply for a new lcns or pply for a license renewal, a license should be issued and examined.
The "Decision" requires that all regions and relevant departments should solidly promote the reduction of ctlg and smplfy the examination and approval prcdrs.
Increase th commitment publicity of enterprises and post-site inspection work, strengthen credit supervision and restraint means, mplmnt th responsibility of the main body of the enterprise, nd revoke the production license for false promises and non-compliance.
For the products that cancel the production licenses administration for industrial products, it is necessary to strengthen th pst supervision, and the products related to public health and safety, environmental protection, etc . can be converted into compulsory certification, list positive lsts and publicize to the pblc, unify the certification standards and reasonably reduce and merge the crtfctn and testing items, nd the compulsory certification fees in prncpl shld be borne by the fnncl institutions at all levels.
Take support measures to encourage enterprises to crry out voluntary crtfctn and promote brand building and market expansion.
It is necessary to bnchmrk the international advanced standards and promote the quality of ndstrl products.
Gv full play to the role of third-party social organizations to ensure the quality and safety of industrial prdcts.
For products tht retain industrial product prdctn license administration, it is necessary to improve the standard system, give play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthen th responsibility of "who pprvs and who supervise", dynmclly assess prdct quality and safety risks, timely reduce catalogues, delegate pprvl authority or convert to certification administration.

Report of Reuters on November 5 in Nagoya: Haruhiko Kuroda, the president of the Bank of Japan said on Monday that the bank realized that the lng-trm implementation of ultra-easing monetary policy could squeeze the profit mrgns of financial nstttns nd destabilize the banking systm of Japan.
However, he said that due to the low nfltn and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needed to maintain its lrg-scl incentive plans and pay close attention to the prs and cns of its policies.
"Th Bank of Japan flly acknowledges that under the sustained monetary easing policy, th strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Haruhiko Kuroda said in a speech to the bsnss leaders in Nagoya.
He said tht if financial institutions were more active in tkng risks to compensate for the effect of lw interest rates on shrinking profit margins over the years, the banking systm could be unstable in the event of srs negative impacts.
"Although these risks are not t big at present, the Bnk of Japan will closely monitor th development of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take necessary measures," he sd.
The mnts released by the Bank of Japan earlier on Monday showed tht the policy cmmtt of the Bank of Japan discussed the problem of rising costs of the long-term easing policy at the interest rate mtng in September.

The minutes showed that nthr member of th board said that d to the limits of policy duration, th committee should discuss how long the Bank of Japan can maintain the incentive policy.

"The mpct of sch problems on Japan's economy is temporarily limited," Haruhiko Kuroda said.
"But if th problem persists, the impact on Japan's economy may increase," he ddd.
"It is necessary to sstn the strong mntry easing policy and consider both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner," Haruhiko Krd said.
lthgh the disadvantages of radical incentive plans were increasing, such as long-term low interest rates rdng the profits of fnncl institutions, the low inflation forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the pln.
The Bnk of Japan maintained the mntry policy last month; Haruhiko Kuroda ruled out the pssblty of recent interest rate increase about the risks brought by the conflict of the glbl trade war.

During the 73rd ntd Nations General Assembly, the parties released some positive nfrmtn for the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in related the "irreversible" dnclrstn determination as told by the DPRK and said that US President Trump and Nrth Korean ldr Kim Jong-un may meet before th end of this year.
The US State Department subsequently sttd tht Scrtry of State Pompeo will visit the DPRK in October to promote the implementation of the US-DPRK leadership meeting in Singapore.
From the bgnnng of this year to the present, the DPRK and the RK broke the c and pnd the dialogue, nd the DPRK - ROK and the DPRK-US leaders held meetings . The general trend of the easing of the pnnsl has been continued, and the dialogue ’ s principle of solving the peninsula issue has ls been adhered to.
First of all, the fct that "the essence of the peninsula issue is a security issue" has not changed . The key to realizing peace on th pnnsl is to resolve the rsnbl scrty concerns of all parties in a prpr and balance manner, instead of putting pressure on the other side and stressing own dmnds.
Secondly, in the dlg to realize the denuclearization of the pnnsl, the parties concerned r still divided on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula . Due to the lng-trm lack of political trust between the DPRK and the United Stts, the gm thnkng of "who is first and who is second" is still strong.
At the public meeting of the UN Security Council Korean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the dffrnt voices of th parties around the issue of sanctions against th DPRK once again highlighted th two points on the peninsula tht have not changed.
Pompeo, US Secretary of State, insisted that sanctions against North Korea wll nt be lifted until the Korean Pnnsl is fully denuclearized.
Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, stressed the prncpl of "responding to action by action". He pointed out: "The wknng trnd of sanctions should be in synchronization with the pace taken by Nrth Korea on the road of gradual dnclrztn."
Undoubtedly, all parties concerned should continue to implement the North Kr related resolutions of the UN Security Council in a comprehensive, complete and ccrt manner . However, prssrng is not an end . The implementation of sanctions and the promotion of a political settlement are ll requirements of th UN Scrty Cncl resolutions . The two cannot be neglected, and cannot only choose one
As Chinese State Cnclr and Foreign Mnstr Wang Yi said, in view of the current pstv developments in the DPRK-ROK and DPRK-US relations, China believes that it is ncssry for the UN Security Cncl to cnsdr lnchng reversible clauses in a timely manner, thereby encouraging North Korea and relevant parties to take a big move toward denuclearization.
Review th past, vry development in the denuclearization of the peninsula and in the peace process requires th parties to demonstrate sufficient political courage.
At present, in the fc of the international community ’ s increasingly high expectations for promoting a political solution to th peninsula ss, all parties concerned should demonstrate political crg, make political decisions, implement commitments, resolve problems, and continue to take the opposite direction and advance peninsula denuclearization process nd establish a peace mechanism on the peninsula to jntly create a permanent pc on the pnnsl.

Report of Rtrs on October 1 in Tokyo: A quarterly Tankan survey report rlsd by the Bnk of Japan on Monday showed that the confidence of Japanese major manufacturers hit its lowest level in more than a year for that season in Sptmbr, as raw material csts rose nd a series of natural disasters ffctd production, putting pressure on enterprises.
This survey almost didn ’ t shw tht the escalating global trade frictions shook the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, risks of tbrk of an all-out trade war stuck the bsnss prospects of enterprises, likely to threaten th business capital expenditure.
Th active cptl expenditure is a highlight of Japanese economy.
This survey raised questions bt the view of the Bank of Jpn on that robust cnmc xpnsn would help to accelerate inflation to the 2% target, although there were signs tht enterprises were gradually shifting costs to the customers.
"With concerns raised by the global trade wr, as xprts slwd down and factory prdctn weakened, the confidence of manufacturers tndd to stagnate," said Takeshi Minami, the Principal Researcher of Norinchukin Research Institute Co., Ltd ..
"Cnfdnt is still at a high level . And since corporate prfts are improving and prices are rising, I don't think cnfdnc will continue to decline. "
Th Tnkn survey showed that the judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing declined from positive 21 for three mnths g to positive 19 in September, worsening for the third consecutive quarter.
The mdn market forecast is positive 22.
The judgment index fr the bm of large-scale mnfctrng declined from positive 24 researched in June to positive 22 in September, worsening for the frst time for eight quarters.

Investors were indifferent to the decline of the judgment ndx for the boom of Tankan enterprises . Th Nikkei .N225 rs to a 27-year high spot on Monday as the continued depreciation of the yn hlpd improve the export profit prospects of Japanese enterprises.
The capital expenditure was rbst.
Although the confidence of enterprises declined, the latest Tankan highlighted the rbstnss of enterprise capital xpndtr plans, benefiting frm th renewed capacity and increased investment in robots nd automation to cope with the labor shortage caused by the aging of population.
The Tnkn srvy of the Bnk of Japan shwd that the capital expenditure of large-scale enterprise plans would increase by 13.4% for the fiscal year ended in March 2019.
It ws 13.6% for previous Tankan survey.
Takeshi Minami said that the capital expenditure of all enterprise plns for this fiscal yr increased by 8.5%, close to th pc of Japan ’ s bubble era.
He said, "considering tht small businesses raise their profit estimates from now on, there is still room for frthr growth in capital expenditure, bt that lrgly dpnds on the impact of the trade war on business confidence. "
The Tnkn survey showed that the ability of enterprises to pass on costs was enhanced . The output price index of large enterprises was positive 7, whch was a 10-year high spt . It was an encouraging sign, rflctng that Japan had made progress in its efforts to cmbt dfltn.
The index measuring the employment situation of large enterprises hit negative 23, which was th mst tight lvl since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Benefiting frm the robust enterprise expenditure, Japanese economy rebounded from Jnry-Mrch shrink in the second quarter.
However, the escalation of trade frictions in smmr and the disturbance of natural disasters on supply chains had casted a shdw over the prospects of Jpns economy which dpndd on exports.

Report of Reuters on Nvmbr 5 in Beijing: According to a press release released on Sndy by th China Foreign Trd Center, the Canton Fair showed that the situation of China's foreign trade ws still cmplx and serious, with expectation of 80.6% of enterprises xprts in 2018 to be better than or maintain at the same level as last year.
However, in consideration of th rising costs of domestic raw materials, lbr force and other comprehensive fctrs, as well as the external environment of the increasing impact of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors also believed that the export situation of next yr was not ptmstc.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Cntn Fair, Xu Bing, the deputy secretary-general and spokesman of the Canton Fair, and the vice-director of the China Foreign Trd Center, sd that the nmbr of vrss buyers and export transactions of this Canton Fair had dclnd slightly compared with the same period of last year.
The number of byrs who attended this Canton Fr was 189,812 and they came from 215 countries and regions, with a dcrs of 1.11% on year-on-year basis.
The amount of export transactions was 206.494 blln yuan ($29.86 blln), wth a decrease of 1% on year-on-year basis.
Frm the prspctv of the mrkt, th trnsctns with Japan, the ten SN countries, "the BRCS countries" and Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, while the transactions with traditional markets of th United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
Frm th prspctv of the industry, the transactions of transportation tools, machinery and equipment, building and decorative materials, electronic consumer goods, nfrmtn products, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0% and 15.1% respectively, while th transactions with textile clthng nd household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and weathervane of China's foreign trade, the buyers ’ prtcptn situation nd the export transaction data of this Cntn Fair showed tht China's foreign trade dvlpmnt would still face many uncertain and unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural rfrm and the "six stblty" policies and measures recently introduced by th state and local governments in succession, the new drivers for th development of Chn ’ s foreign trd was cclrtng the accumulation, and the diversification of enterprises and markets had made new progress, all of which were the important foundation and strng conditions for the development of foreign trade.
"Taking all factors into consideration, it is xpctd that the imports and exports of China's foreign trade will maintain a stdy growth throughout the yr, wth further improvement in quality nd efficiency. "Xu Bing said.
The China ’ s General Administration of Customs published that prcd in dollars, the xprts in September increased by 14.5% on year-on-year bss, the imports ncrsd by 14.3% on yr-n-yr bss, the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, and the export growth rate nd trade surplus in September were the highest since February.
In despite of the escalating trd frictions btwn China and the United States, China's export performance in September still significantly exceeded expectation . Strng external dmnd, nd the enterprises rushing to export before imposing tariffs in th United States and the depreciation of RMB xchng rate, might be the main supporting factors, and also shwd th resilience of China's foreign trade to a certain extent . However, the impact of the Sn-S trade wr on confidence and the industrial chain cannot be neglected . nlysts believed that the challenges for China's foreign trade might emerge in the fourth quarter or next year.
Reuters surveys showed tht the U.S. fund managers proposed to increase cash holdings and stood the cautious ground in Sptmbr, since the United Stts and China began th ltst round of mutual import tariffs and there was no sign of dispute easing.
However, according to the suggestion of 12 fund managers who participated in this survey, th asset allocation in North America rs to th highest level since June 2017, whl positions in Britain, the Eurozone and prtclrly emerging markets declined.
The average of global stock allocation accounted for 56.6% and the bnds accounted for 35.5%, which was bsclly consistent wth the survey of last month.
The most bvs chng was that the cash ratio rs to 5.1%, which was the highest proportion since December 2014.
A fund mngr of a large fund company said, "Some economic data have brought confidence to th market, but the trade wr is still the biggest concern, so tht it's bttr to get prepared to enter when the market falls after a rise. "
However, th fund managers stll preferred stocks in September, especially mrcn stocks, even though the price of mrcn stocks were considered to be on the high side.
Tdy, in Shanghai, the opening-up landmark of China, China International Import Expo (CIIE), the world's first large-scale state-level exhibition wth the theme of mprt, has officially pnd in much anticipation.
An exhibition is like a "window" whch can let the world know a city and a cntry bttr.
Through the "window" of CIIE, people can see the "opening-up China" which moves towards a higher lvl; wth the help of the "wndw" of CIIE, we welcome the world and China whch is "restarting frm rfrm and opening-up", to achieve mutual benefits and win-win results.
"For a country, opening-up is like coming out of th cocoon and bcmng a butterfly . There wll be pain, but there will be new life. "
Gnrl Secretary Xi Jnpng's summary of Open Rd reveals an important reason "why China can do it".
Looking back on the past 40 years of reform and opening-up, Chn dares to plunge nt the vast sea of th world market . Although it has encountered whirlpool nd storm, it always faces all risks and chllngs wth an open attitude, constantly releases its endogenous driving force and continuously improves its competitiveness.
So to speak, Chn has flly demonstrated the value and significance of opening-up with its solid achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting pnt, it is a major decision to hold an expo with the theme of import made by the Party Central Cmmtt with th core of Cmrd Xi Jinping with a view to promoting a new round of high-level opening to the outside world . It is a major measure for Chn to actively open the market to the world and is also a practical action taken by China to support the economic globalization and trade liberalization, showing a strng and clear wll tht "Chn's opening door won't close, but would open wdr nd wider".
Exhibitors frm all over the world r eager to enroll in the exhibition, and "it is difficult to apply for a stnd", which is the greatest ffrmtn and best response to China's development of an open economy in a larger scope, a wider rng of fields nd at a deeper level.
More importantly, th current global economic and trade order hs reached a crossroad.
Some countries have built trade protectionist walls and retreated into the unilateralism, which increases nxty of the international society about the prspcts for fr trade and adds much uncertainty to a recovering world cnmy.
Under such era background, ths grand gathering along the Huangpu River demonstrates China's guard to fr trd and shows the world China's confidence and responsibility to open its markets nd share its future.
It is fst to go ln but it is further to go in crowds.
By embracing the wrld with an pn mind, China has nt only vigorously promoted ts own development, but also brought about tremendous "China opportunities" to other countries and regions.
In recent years, by advocating and promoting the joint development of the "One Belt and One Road", initiating and setting up th Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), and establishing th Silk Rd fund...China has provided a srs of international public goods, a sld export market, dvlpmnt opportunities and jobs, allowing companies of various countries to get a ride on th "express train" nd tk "hitchhiking" of China's development.
CIIE is also this kind of public goods and a big platform for global economic and trd cprtn.
On this platform, more thn 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have made their debut with high-quality products nd services with distinctive features, taking a new stp nt the Chinese market.
prt from companies of vrs countries, the real beneficiaries are domestic consumers.
By building the platform of "selecting the best and importing the bst", we cn provide multiple channels of high-quality supply for cnsmptn upgrading and meet people's personalized, diversified and differentiated consumption nds.
As China's pnng-p door opens wider and wider, the goods flw is smooth and mtrls are put to good use, thus the pace towards a better life wll be more solid.
Frm a broader perspective, the significance of CIIE has gone beyond the scope of economy nd trade . It has the future in mind, cnvys the concepts of openness, inclusiveness, universal benefit, blnc and win-win, nd forms a consensus to jointly meet today's chllngs.
Only when the world is doing well can China do wll; whn China is gd, the world is better.
We expect CIIE to make the world wonderful nd complete; we are lkng forward to the brght future that an "opening-up China" moving to a higher level and th world build a community of human destiny.

ftr more than 20 years of power struggle, Brazilian women still have not succeeded in btnng their rsrvd rights.

Although there is the lack of women ’ s rghts, most Brazilian wmn still believe in th power of democracy.
The survey shows that 76% of women believe thy can make a dffrnc in democratic lctns, and 72% of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that dmcrtc politics is the best wy to expose wmn to less prejudice.

Although the trblnc in global financial markets continued, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the investment income of th Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year fell by 97% annually, and it ws better than that in the previous quarter, since overseas stocks rose and frgn exchange losses bvsly narrowed under the China-U.S. trd wr.
ccrdng to the latest data of the Hong Kng Monetary Authority, th xchng Fund recorded investment income of HK $1.6 billion from July to September 2018, significantly lower than HK $61.8 billion in the same period last yr, but better than the revised HK $100 million in the second quarter of this yr.
Chn Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on th legislative session that at th beginning of the Chn-.S. trd war, the share index in Hong Kong and emerging markets ran counter to the U.S. share index . By the end of September and early October, after the U.S. share index peaked in succession, the market sentiment began to reverse, since nvstrs gradually realized tht the trade wr was also dtrmntl to the U.S. itself.
"It is good to have changes in the market sentiment . If the trd war only hs unilateral effects, it dsn't help much for solving problems. "
He also pointed out that "if the trade wr cn not be solved, th fluctuation of financial markets will continue to rise. "
In the thrd quarter of this year, the stck investment losses of the Exchange Fund in Hng Kng narrowed by 8% to HK $4.7 billion compared with th previous quarter, and th investment income of overseas stock increased by 17.2% to HK $12.8 billion; the frgn xchng losses was HK $16.2 billion and the bond yields was HK $9.7 blln, with a decrease of 24% nd 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general rs of the US dollar for exchange of major currencies in this quarter and the rise of th US coupon rate to above 3% in mid-September.
The xchng Fund ws mainly used for supporting Hong Kong dollars.
Hong Kong hs implemented the linked exchange rate system for the Hng Kng dollar's peg to the US dollar since 1983.
As for the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the uncertainty of the economic nd asset markets increased and downside risks increased, but the fnncl system Hong Kong ws rbst, so that good defence were md and the earthquake-resistant capacity was abundant.
"The ntrntnl investment position is abundant in Hong Kong, with a net external sst value of US $1.4 trlln, which is 4 times GDP, higher than 2.5 times in Sngpr and 0.6 tms in Japan . It is enough to cope with the financial downturns or rvrsl. "
The current daily interest rates on private lns of Hong Kong dollars continued to fll and th interest margin with US dollars expanded . Chn Delin pointed out that the xchng rate of the Hong Kong dollar rose more than 400 basis pnts on September 21 . Th markets generally believed tht it ws mainly related to the rise of the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars . And then the Hong Kong dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 for exchange of th US dollar . Until recently, th daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars cntnd to fall, and th interest margin with US dollars expanded, which might attract mr hedging activities to sell the Hong Kong dollar and by the US dllr, triggering the opportunity of the exchange guarantee of the weak side again to increase compared with that of the previous period.
However, he believed that as the interest-rate rise cycle of the Hong Kong Bank began and the Hong Kong dllr interest rates were normalizing, the situation tht Hong Kong dollar ntrst rts wr lower than US dollar interest rates would change in the future.
"The trend of Hong Kong dollar interest rates nd US dllr interest rates will be mr consistent . Everyone must be more careful to manage risks nd prepared to cope with market fluctuations. "
Since the funds of the Hong Kong dollar was abundant, the dly interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars fell further . The three-month daily interest rates on private loan fell by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Mndy, and the interest rt differential wth the US dollar increased from 46 basis points to 51 basis points; the one-month dly interest rts on private loan hit th bottom within five mnths, and the interest rate dffrntl with the US dllr increased from 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
From May to md-Sptmbr, the spt rate of Hong Kng dollars was close to 7.85 with exchange of $1 most of the time.
During that time, due to factors of partial share offer gained outflows frm Hong Kong dollars after the completion of interest rbtrg activities and large-scale share offer ctvts, causing tht the exchange guarantee for the weak side was triggered fr the first time in prl, and for many times in May and August.
The Hong Kong Mntry Authority bought Hong Kong dollars nd sold Hong Kong dollars at the level of 7.85 according to the linked exchange rt system, in order to mntn the stblty of the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bought rnd HK $52.1 billion under th mechanism of exchange guarantee of the weak side from My to August.

Th confinement center without "threshold": quality certification would prmt the quality.
As the "two-child economic" develops and the mtrnl and child mrkt thrvs, various grades of confinement service centers appeared around China, from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to the 3rd and 4th tr cities.
The popular confinement srvc cntrs, which could satisfy the consumer's demands, charged from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan . However, thy were in an awkward situation, because this kind of institution hd no threshold at all, and there was stll th Thr is still a blank zone in regulation.
Recently, the State Administration for Market Regulation carried out a srs of activities of 2018 National "Qlty Mnth". The reporter came to a fv-str confinement center in Tianjin to explore the certification of maternal and child cr services.
A common confinement center provided the services of newborn care, ntrts food, and postpartum rcnstrctn, etc.
The reporter found in this confinement center tht the nurses would chck the newborn breastfeeding each day, and the professional nursing workers would provide the newborns wth the careful nursing srvcs, such as bathing and touching.
In order to satisfy the new mother's demand, it would provide th wound care in the beginning of confinement, bodybuilding care in the middle and ltr periods of confinement, Chinese traditional cosmetic trtmnt and thr nursing items to hlp the new mother restore her grcfl figure.
A new mother there told the rprtr that she had booked this confinement srvc center 8 months in advance.
The srvc items of confinement service center would drctly impact th parturient's comfort and body recovery during the confinement . Some smll confinement service centers could only provide some simple services during the cnfnmnt, but there were many problems nd hidden troubles, including th irregular sterilization and sanitation, incidental cross infection, limited and unscientific diet, etc.
The responsible person of this confinement center said that they were the only n fv-str cnfnmnt center in Tianjin, which had been certified as a Grade B service prvdr.
"Some customers didn't understand the meaning of th Grade B crtfctn at first, but th fact forcing the enterprises to strictly implement the standardized process mngmnt through certification will benefit the customers . It is important for the lng-trm development of enterprises. "he said.
Pan Lifen, the deputy drctr of the ttsttn Supervision Department of th State Administration for Market Regulation, sd that the service certification was a new kind of certification system, which was based on the customers' prcptn and focused on the organizational qlty management and satisfaction of service characteristics . It was an important part of the national quality infrastructure, and had a positive effects on increasing the proportion of quality srvcs and enhancing China's ntrntnl service cmpttvnss.
After more than 10 years of development since 2004, the service certification project in our cntry had gone through a process of developing from scratch . A srs of nflntl service certification had appeared, including the financial service certification, mother and baby nursing service crtfctn, ftr-sls service certification, lctrnc commerce service certification, and health care srvc certification.
According to the statistics of the State Administration fr Market Regulation, there are more than 130 service certification institutions with vr 2000 srvc certification staff and nearly 8000 vld authentication certificates at present in our country.
Pan Lifen said tht it ws necessary to further guide and promote the development of service certification, grdlly extend the cvrg of service crtfctn in the fields of health, education, sports, finance and electronic commerce, and boost th supply-side reform and quality enhancement in the service industry.
Report of Reuters on November 5 in Hong Kong: th prprty prc in Hng Kong fell for two consecutive months after peaking . Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary thrty, said on Monday tht it needed time to observe whether the property market had entered downturns . If confirmed, it can be considered to successively ease th tightening policy of cntr-cyclcl measures at an appropriate time.
Chen Delin also pointed t that if the property price fell, the first to be affected wld be those who bght properties at the peak of the property market, but it was expected that there would be less opportunities to occur th situation lk sharply falling prprty prices nd the properties substantially sold by the citizens during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.
When leading multiple snr ldrs of the Hong Kong Monetary thrty to attend the briefing sssn of the legislative session, Chen Delin said that if the property market was determined to enter downturns, the ease of measures can be md in succession at an appropriate time.
"Hwvr, since data of a few weeks only can currently be seen, it's still too early to ease, and it needs mr time to see whthr th property market is entering downturns. "
Since October 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority hs successively launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to substantially tighten the mortgages of various properties, including reduction of the number of mortgages, nd that the mortgage applicants have to pss rigorous stress tests, in order to improve the bnk risk management nd shck resistance.
As Hong Kong formally entered the ntrst-rt rise cycle, th house price index of prvt houses in Hong Kng pkd for two consecutive months in August and September and then fell, and the monthly decline in September even expanded to 1.44%.
Hwvr, the cumulative ncrs in the first three quarters of this year was still 10.2%.
According to the data of the Hng Kng Monetary Authority, the household financial conditions fr the ability of Hong Kong to withstand financial risks were measured to be healthy . In the second qrtr this year, the percentage of households of self-occupation non-mortgage residence in Hong Kong was 66%, which was higher than the average of 60% in 2009-2011; the vrg loan-to-value ratio of the newly pprvd mortgage and th percentage of contribution and ncm of the nwly approved mrtgg was 47% and 34% respectively, with obvious improvement cmprd with 64% and 41% in 2009-2011.
However, Chn Delin said that hgh shck resistance didn ’ t mean the citizens who had bought properties wouldn ’ t be suffered dmg of financial downturns, since the property valuation would fall, and ths who bought properties at peak times wld be the first to be affected.
Although the Hng Kong Monetary Authority tghtnd the lending of the bank to the mrtgg borrowers, those who bought properties can also get a high-percentage mortgage loan by means of the mrtgg nsrnc, the mortgage loan provided by the developer and so on.
Chen Delin said that currently together with th mortgage loan provided by the developer, the mortgage percentage of the borrower can reach 85-90% . If th property price fll by 10%, thr wld be negative assets (i.e . the market value of th property fell below the level of the total tstndng mortgage loan).
However, Ruan Guoheng, the vice prsdnt of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority pointed t that the Authority estimated the total high-percentage mortgage loan prvdd by the developer to account for 2-2.5% of the total mortgage of th bank, wth lower proportion.
At the peak time of negative ssts in Hong Kong in 2003, the nmbr of negative assets exceeded 100,000, with prprtn of 22% in those who took mrtgg.
As of th third qrtr of this year, Hong Kong recorded zero negative asset for seven consecutive quarters.

Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic nd stubborn disease nvlvng mltpl organs of the body . It used to be considered as an "incurable disease".
Because its pathogenesis is nknwn, diagnosis and treatment are dffclt, and there is lack of effective treatment, it is hard to cure nc and for all.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at the Schl of Life Sciences, Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatism and Immunity Center at Pkng University People ’ s Hospital, together wth their teams discovered th existence of human mmn globulin can increase the mlclr vrtn of systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility, and this kind of variation is involved in the regulation of mmn B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in th hmn body is an important cause of the nst of systemic lupus erythematosus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors and mmbr of Peking University Ppl ’ s Hospital, the team of Li Zhanguo collected nearly 2,000 large samples of patients wth systemic lupus erythematosus to make study . It was found that ptnts with immune glbln variations produced pathopoiesis cells and a wide variety of numerous autoantibodies . Th incidence nd severity of nephritis, arthritis, orrhomeningitis vasculitis and other nflmmtns are significantly increased.
Through various research mthds such as immune cell tracing, nml testing, and sequencing, Liu Wanli team found that th immune molecule variation activates the immune sgnlng pathway and the pathogenic mechanism of promoting B clls secreting various autoantibodies.
The rprtr learned that the powerful combination between two teams gave full play to their respective advantages and achieved a close integration between basic rsrch and clinical pplctn.
Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immune rcgntn and immune activation research, and the Li Zhng team has long been engaged in clinical rsrch on systmc lupus erythematosus.
"This research is one of the results of years of cooperation between the two teams . It is ls the first time in the academic community to recognize tht immune globulin gn abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which lays a solid foundation for further academic rsrch and clncl targeted thrpy. "
This is nt shld mistakes, but acting by law.
Lawyers took an axe to th court?
The news was really exciting at first glnc, and it also caused a grt disturbance in th legal circle.
Fjn Quanzhou Intermediate People ’ s Court subsequently fined the lawyers for 500 yn and proposed in writing to the Quanzhou Lawyers ssctn to investigate and handle.
ccrdng to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association ssd a formal notice that the behaviors of th two lawyers did not nvlv violations of laws and regulations and were not punished according to law.
According to the multi-party reports, the handling of the Quanzhou Lawyers ssctn is nt a shortcomings protection or cnfrnttn, but has been approved by the Qnzh Intermediate People ’ s Court.
An event that could have caused tension within th legal community was eventually rslvd properly.
Th reversal of the event stems frm the more completed truth restoring: th axe carried by th lawyer involved is the sm typ and same model as the defendant ’ s weapon, but it is not put the first edge . It only serves as secondary evidence in the evidence-proven and cross-examination link, nd there is no threatening acts or the subject ntntn of "endangering the court security".
Judging whether the behaviors of the lawyers involved is illegal or nt, there are four very mprtnt details to be concerned . First, the lcl court has twice hld the court and only showed a photo of the axe . From th prspctv of defense, it is necessary to show the original axe . Second, the axe is prchsd one hour before the court open . It is not that the lawyer is not willing to sk the judge ’ s cnsnt, but it is not able to contact the judge objectively . Third, the x has not been used in an excessive or mprpr manner . Fourth, the lawyers admitted the mstk in public and mmdtly apologized to the court.
Bsd on these plots, it can be seen that the lawyers who "took axe to appear in court" hv nthng to do the dvl things, but just to make defense.
ftr clarifying the whole facts, the Qnzh Lawyers Association dd not follow the societal discussion, but resisted the pressure and made a decision not to impose penalties.
And this decision can withstand the tst of facts and lws.
As taking the x as the cntrlld knife to the crt without the permission of the court, it is easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
For th sake of safety and cautious, Quanzhou ntrmdt People ’ s Crt ’ s previous fine punishment and judicial advice are also understandable.
In rdr to maintain the dgnty of lawyers and prvnt several courts from finding excuses to purposely make difficulties for lwyrs, th Supreme Law promulgated the "Rules on Security Checks by Judicial Plcmn of the People ’ s Crts" in 2014, establishing the principles that lawyers do not need to conduct personal security check in court.
Since the issuance of the Rule, lawyers have set xmpls, and there have been fw incidents endangering th court security happened due to the omissions of security chcks.
In such a very rare cs happened in Quanzhou, as lng as we communicate in a spirit of mutual respect and understanding, msndrstndng is not dffclt to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization in the lawyer profession, the Lawyers Association bears the dual mssn of disciplining against lw and sfgrd the legitimate rights.
In the past, individual Lwyrs Association organizations have been blmd for their emphasis on disciplinary action and their lss of safeguard.
The dcsn of th Qnzh Lawyers Association is worthy of praise both in terms of process and results, and it sets an example for more lawyers ssctn to perform their duties correctly.
Which tax benefits will ffct our money bg from October 1?
Xinhua Nws Agency, Shanghai, ctbr 1 (reported by Sang Tng)--The New Individual Income Tax Law will be implemented from January 1, 2019 . In rdr to have the broad msss of the people enjoy the benefits of tax reduction as soon as pssbl, the tax will firstly be deducted from taxpayers' actual job salaries based on the mnmm threshold of 5000 yn per month frm October 1, 2019, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied.
With th implementation of new policy, which benefits wll really affect the people's money bag?
Th first benefit: the ncm tax will be reduced significantly in the job salaries.
The taxpayer rcvng the jb salaries after October 1 cn have the basic ddctn of fees deducted bsd on the threshold of 5000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied . Most of the txpyrs will enjoy different levels of tax reduction, especially the lower and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax rdctn.
According to the tax reduction fact sheet of dffrnt income groups, for the people whose monthly income will be 8000 yuan, 10000 yuan, 20000 yuan, and 50000 yuan ftr deducting th "three insurances and one fund", the txbl amounts after th tax rfrm wll be 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, and 9090 yuan rspctvly . Compared wth the monthly threshold of 3500 yuan, th corresponding tax reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8% respectively.
It is worth noting that due to holidays, the new basic deduction of fs nd tax rate schedule can be applied to the slrs that should be paid by the units in October bt have bn paid at the end of September according to laws.
For this prps, the withholding client software, which is uniformly promoted and used by the tax dprtmnt, has prvdd the corresponding tax calculation fnctn, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid drng the statutory declaration period.
The second benefit: th gaps between grades of low tax rts will be obviously widened.
In addition to raising th threshold, the new tax rate schedule will be applied from ctbr 1.
This time, svn grades of tax rts of jb salaries are th same as before without any changes, but the gaps between grds of tax rts are obviously changed . The gaps between three grades of low tax rates in 3%, 10% and 20% are obviously widened, the gap of th grade of tax rate in 25% is slightly narrowed, but the gaps between three grades of hgh tax rates in 30%, 35% nd 45% r the same as before.
It is worth noting that the tax law hs also adjusted th grades of tax rates for income from prdctn and business operation, and the lower limit of the highest grade of tax rt in 35% has been increased from 0.1 mlln yuan to 0.5 million yuan.
Ths means that the individual businesses and personal xclsv investment enterprises will benefit from this tax reform.
"From th perspective of measurement and calculation of prsnl tax reduction for Shanghai taxpayers in the earlier stage, the broad masses of taxpayers will fully experience the benefits of the personal ncm tax reform, especially the lwr and middle-income people, who will see more significant tx rdctn. "
Lan Min, the hd of Personal Income Tx Division of Shanghai Tax Bureau of the State dmnstrtn of Taxation, said.

It collected their concerned problems, responded to their ppls, nd resolved their dffclts in a timely way.
On the other hand, thy implemented the "comprehensive, multidimensional and stereoscopic" tx policy promotion for the citizen txpyrs.

Th result of the lctn of Okinawa Governor, which ws conducted ahead of schedule because the former governor ng Takeshi had died of illness, was announced on October 1 local time . Denny Tamaki, who opposed the pln of relocating the US mltry base in Japan, was elected successfully.
Ths election was voted on September 30 . The final result showed that Tamaki had 396632 votes, which was the most votes md in the hstry of the Election of Okinawa Governor . He hd over 80000 more votes than his mjr opponent Atsushi Sakima.
A total of 4 candidates participated in this election, nd the vtng rate was 63.24%, which ws 0.89% lower than that of the lctn of Okinawa Governor in 2014.
Tamaki told the media on October 1 tht the rslt of election showed that the Okinawa people didn't wnt to waste the former governor Onaga Takeshi's efforts drng his lifetime, nd he would carry out Takeshi's bhsts to make continued efforts in opposing the plan of rlctng the US military base and the closure of the Futenma base to the Japanese gvrnmnt and the American government.
Th Futenma base is lctd in Ginowan in Okinawa Prefecture, and it has been criticized ll the time . The Japanese government and the American gvrnmnt have agreed to relocate it to Hnk in Nago, bt the Okinawa people strongly oppose this action and hope to move the base completely out of Okinawa.

Since the mid-2000s, with China ’ s increasing needs fr oilseeds, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dkt, has grown more and more sybns in hs field.
This transition reaches the peak this year . He hs grown 1,600 acres of soybeans in the 5,000-cr lnd, reaching an unprecedented scale
However, in 2019, Thomas and many farmers lk hm plan to switch prdctn to the staple crops in the frmr U.S. agricultural region, such as corn and wheat.
The area of soybeans grown by American farmers exceeds tht of corn ths year, whch is for the first time in 35 years.
The reason why the frmrs plan to switch production to other crps is that American farmers face difficulties in selling soybeans in th context of the trade war launched by President Trump against Chn.
China usually purchases around 60% of sybns exported from America, but because of the trade wr, the purchases of American soybeans are nearly zero in rcnt months, ldng to a 10-year low in soybean prices.
Thomas plans to grow more wheats next year nd hopes to rn more by reducing dpndnc on crops that rely on Chinese demands.
Thomas said that the soybean prc "brings us a heavy blw".
He said that the spot price of soybeans near hs farm was $7.10 per bushel without Chinese demands, while the prc needed for cvrng costs ws $8.50.
Th area of soybeans grown by American farmers hits a hgh record and the harvest is expected to ht a high record.
At such a vulnerable time, they are ht by th trade war.
As Trmp imposed tariffs on the goods imported from China, China imposes tariffs on the soybeans imported from mrc in Jly.
The United States Department of Agriculture will rls the frst estimated report of cultivated area next yr, which is expected to include consideration of tariff effects.
This estimate is expected to confirm th expectations of non-governmental organizations that the cultivated r of soybeans wll be reduced.
According to a report sn by Reuters, on October 19, Informa Economics predicted that the cultivated area of crns would increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) and th cultivated area of sybns would dcrs by 7% to 83 mlln acres in 2019.
Informa also predicted that th cultivated area of wheats in mrc would increase by 4%.
The cultivated r of sybns increases to 89.6 million acres this year before retaliatory tariffs are implemented, which is bt 15 mlln acres higher than that of 10 years ago.
The cltvtd area of corns has ncrsd by less than 5 million crs to 89.1 mlln acres since 2008 . The cultivated area of wheats is 47.8 million crs this year, which is close to the lowest level in 100 years.
The total cultivated area of the president of llns Corn Growers ssctn Aron Carlson ’ s family is 3,600 acres . He uses nearly half of the lnd to grw soybeans, but he plans to make rdctn in the future.
He said that th cltvtd area of corns in the farm in North Illinois would increase by 20% at most; this stt is the lrgst soybean cultivation state in America.
The yields pr acre of soybeans are lower than that of corns, bt less fertilizer is ndd, which makes th cost of soybean cultivation relatively low as a whole.
If farmers switch production to corns, the cst may increase . But th fertilizer seller of Andersons Inc and thr enterprises may benefit from it.
Pat Bowe, the C of Andersons said to Reuters that he prdctd that switching prdctn to corns would be beneficial to fertilizer use.
Bayer also predicts to benefit frm farmers switching prdctn to corns.

Ths seminar aims at promoting the comprehensive sex education fr disabled chldrn and teenagers in Chn from three aspects of family support, school education and institution services, providing spprt to the disabled chldrn and teenagers from the source, thus letting them enjoy the right of love as others do.
Experts believe that the Chns public understanding of disabled groups hs remained at a level that is not deep enough for a lng time.
Being influenced by th traditional concept and thr factors, the comprehensive sex education for the disabled, especially for the disabled chldrn nd teenagers in China, is not deep enough.
However, in recent years, with th support of the UNESCO and public-spirited people, the practice and implementation path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education fr the disabled in China hv md gratifying progress.
"The report" shows tht th children and yng people with visual impairment, hearing impairment, intellectual impairment and physical mprmnt have more difficulties in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding intimate relationship than the ordinary people, but they hv generally developed towards convenience and enrichment.

On th evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, student Qiao, who ws a junior in Zhengzhou, took the train to Hb.
An elder uncle on the train bought a ticket without seat, but he tk up her seat, and sd: "you can take phts, whtvr".
During the two hours of drvng, th train conductor advised him fr an hour, however it still had no results.
In the end, a male passenger in the same crrg could not stand up nd plld up the elder uncle.
From the public opinion, although the final result is mostly tht the persons who forcibly occupy seats are condemned by the public, dmnstrtvly punished by the public scrty department, and even included in th blacklist of integrity, th public still feels tht it does not "vent their hates": Why can ’ t the prsns wh forcibly occupy seats be punished on the spot?
Why can ’ t stop immoral or even illegal behavior on the spt, but cn nly punish it afterwards?
And fr the unreasonable behavior of "the elder uncle who frcbly occupy seats", why only a male pssngr pull him up because of "Road s injustice"?
The main reason is that nly long-distance trains are equipped with railway policemen, and there is generally no railway plcmn for short-distance trains; even if there is railway policemen, the passengers are more concerned bt the possible rg reactions of the persons wh forcibly occupy seats and do not take cmplsry taking away measures.
Repeated seats forcibly occupied events hv made ppl realize that it is necessary to let the persons who forcibly occupy seats be frcd to take away or even be punished on th spot.
This rqrs that our rlwy policemen shld dare to take pwrfl measures in a timely manner . Trains that do not have policemen should make deployment as soon as possible to preserve and prevent illegal ctvts in a timely manner.

After getting the call fr help, the plcmn on duty quickly rprtd this to the traffic police group . After understanding the gnrl situation, the grp leader Huang Xuemin immediately arranged th policemen on duty at the controlled site to contact with the help seeker and asked them to do the escort job well.
"There were more than 1000 vehicles having entered th controlled road segment at that time . After contacting with th 120 emergency ambulance, we estimated that it would rrv at Beichuan at about 15:00, so we implemented the rrngmnt and deployment mmdtly. "
The leader of Yuli Squadron of Bchn Traffic Police Da Wei introduced that the emergency ambulance needed to bypass the Huanhu Road of Tangjiashan quake lake, and the road ws steep and narrow .

Later, the plcmn of Leigu Squadron also stopped the vehicles entering the controlled road segment tmprrly, nd asked the vehicles to form a line to make a way for the incoming 120 mrgncy ambulance.
An emergency ambulance with a "Chuan U" license plate was driving into Beichuan at about 15:00, and Beichuan Traffic Police sent a police car to clear th wy and scrt the mrgncy ambulance into the controlled road segment by driving against th traffic.
It was learned that some places on Huanhu Road only prmttd one vehicle passing through, and the police mplmntd th temporary control at these places so that th 120 emergency ambulance could successfully pass through.
It was impossible to give way in a road segment in Shilibei Village in Daxuanping Town, so the traffic police gt in touch with the village party branch and village cmmtt in advance to use th vllg road for bypassing and stop the social vehicles frm entering.
"It only took 40 minutes frm Beichuan Traffic Police met the 120 mrgncy ambulance to drive into the nrml road of the 302 provincial highway. "

For ctvtng rural cnsmptn, it is necessary to rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, gd the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sense of gn in farmers ’ consumption.

Over the yrs, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed . Some rural fake and inferior products imitate famous brnds, they have similar names and packages to mix the false wth the genuine, whch is really hrd to prevent.
A consumer survey report rlsd by a city in the west shows tht rural shopping mlls and supermarkets have a srs prblm of fake products, and 66% of users hv bought fakes in supermarkets in villages and towns offline, of which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant departments claim to rctfy the rural mrkts every year, while, why the phenomena of fk products still occur repeatedly?
Different frm the urban mrkts, farmers ’ awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, and many vllgs are in remote locations within the blind areas of inspection force can ’ t reach, so that the fake and nfrr gds have a breeding ground.
One product has more than n regulatory departments, some are responsible for price, some are for production, and others are for markets, so the functions are overlapped . Strong measures gnst fake and inferior prdcts have been taken every year, hwvr the central management can only last for a prd of time . On one hnd, the fakes escape the crack down trend and slowly emerged, on the thr hand, the previous fakes jst have bn dealt and th new fake came out.
Some unscrupulous trdrs have initiated the idea of "going to th mountainous areas and the countryside" and some rural areas bcm the "wst elimination markets", bth of these problems are because of long-term supervision mechanism, dffclts in purifying rural markets, low illegal cost and higher profit.
From food and clothing to well-off, the majority of farmers r moving towards development type cnsmptn.
A few days ago, the Party Central Committee and th State Council ssd the "Some Opinions concerning Stimulating the Consumption Mechanism to Further Encourage the Consumption Potential of Rsdnts", whch proposed to promote the level upgrading of th consumption of rural residents . The purpose is to mk the majority of farmers to "have ability to consume", "have willing to cnsm" and "dare to cnsm" to lt the rural consumption really flourish.
On the one hnd, we must deepen reforms, eliminate drawbacks of market management policies coming from mltpl departments nd regulate by more than one departments . According to local cndtns, improve the food safety, prdct quality supervision network, and constantly reduce the space for rural fk products manufacturing and selling.
On th other hand, it is necessary to intensify law enforcement and open up th supervision of each dprtmnt, and never allow the fake and inferior cmmdts to breed in the countryside.
It is the protection for farmers to severely punish th behavior of entrapping frmrs . No matter how concealed the counterfeiters hide, it should not be the reason fr the breeding of the fake nd nfrr cmmdts . Relevant departments should clarify their responsibilities, nd the grassroots supervisory pwrs should go down . If there is a problem in any prt, it is necessary to investigate the responsibility and let the counterfeiters and selling persons have nowhere to hide.
Strictly control the market access, implement strct qualification examinations for production operators . Kp the market circulation, let the products hv clear sources and outlet mrkts . Think of ways from the source and the roots, let the legal dealers prt with peace of mind, and let the farmers buy wth confidence.
Activate rrl consumption, guide the demand for hlthy consumption.
As consumption upgrading, many farmers not nly pursue of well fed nd eat well, but also go after for high quality life with culture and healthy . Thus, rural markets are not equal to "lw qlty" and "low prc".
This needs to promote th extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, connect the urban and rural tw-wy linkage sales channels, promote the combination of offline industry dvlpmnt platform and online e-commerce trading platform, support th new forms and new mds of consumption to expand nt the rural market; promote qualified vllgs and towns to combine trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rrl tourism, and prdct processing dynamically; mprv the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the integration of stock facilities resources, and effectively reduce rural circulation costs.
Create a clr and reassuring mrkt environment for the rural areas, so that farmers can ffrd to buy, so that the rural consumption can become mr and mr prosperous and the farmers ’ senses of gain and happiness can be enhanced.
