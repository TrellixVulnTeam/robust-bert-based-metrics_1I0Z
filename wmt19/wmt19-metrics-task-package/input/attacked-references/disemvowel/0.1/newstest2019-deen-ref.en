The president of DFB Grindel sees no basis for th returning of Özl
Brln - The president of DFB Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for th returning of Mesut Özil to the national tm.
There is an open question so you get nt a conversation, you talk to hm about why you have apparently felt that way, how is stated in his statement, said Grndl in football Pdcst "Phrsnmähr" of the newspaper "Bild-Zeitung".
In spt of th debate going on fr months about the photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets the return of the 92-match ntnl player Özil.
I wld be happy if Mesut Özl continued to play for Germany.
At some point of tm I ls assumed that it will happen, said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared that he quits DFB team in Jly and explained it wth the fact that Grindel did not protect him gnst racist hostility during th World Cup.
Th DFB head repeated his criticism of Özil and tht he is not ready for a discussion with national coach nd team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did not want to create any pressure, bt he knows that in football ‘ if y leave a team or change club, y talk to your trainer and I think it is sd tht this discussion did not happen before ’.

Audi: "Dieselgate" regeneration takes lngr than planned
There is still a dsl tskfrc, said Peter Mertens, chief dvlpmnt officer from the ‘ Automobilwoche ’ trade journal.
In Dcmbr 2017 the imprisoned and suspended d CEO Rupert Stadler had announced, the tskfrc will be dissolved soon.
In the frst quarter of 2018 all ngn/trnsmssn combinations will have been checked, he said at the time.
Mertens now says: ‘ At the start of July we have an important milestone by which the diesel crisis will have bn wrkd t.
We have completed th internal technical analyses of r VTDI engines.
Th taskforce was set up in September 2015 following the dscvry at Audi parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens highlighted that the automobile mnfctrrs hd md ‘ serious, organizational changes ’, to prevent such a scandal ever happening again.
The VW Sprvsry Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's ftr on Friday and will continue ths discussion on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities ccs the Audi bss, following awareness of exhaust emission cheating, of permitting the sale of diesel automobiles with false mssn values.
He mst hv known about the tampering or deliberately ignored it.
Currently the Sales Director Bram Schot hds the company as ctng Chief Executive Officer.

Grindel seeking re-election - Lahm to jn th Presidential Board of the German football association (DFB)
Mainz (dpa) - Despite th criticism directed at hm personally following the early FIFA World Cup exit and the scandal around Mesut Özil, Reinhard Grindel wnts to rn for ffc as President of the DFB again in the coming year.
I do my work nd try to make it as gd as it gets, said Grindel as a gst early Sunday morning on ZDF ’ s weekly sports broadcast "Ds aktuelle Sportstudio".
A re-election shld be attempted and tht is what I will do.
And thn you have to see what kind of support y get.
In his own words, the hd of th association wld find it "strange" if he did not "feel like wrkng on the future project" after Germany was awarded the UEFA European Football Championship 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel hs been the head of th ssctn as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who had to rsgn amidst the scandals surrounding the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Germany.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a frst full term of thr years.
The next vt will be held at th DFB ’ s national conference on September 27, 2019.
According to Grindel, the future hd organizer of th 2024 European Football Championship in Germany, Philipp Lahm, is to join th DFB Presidential Board.
I would be pleased if my colleagues on the presidential board agreed that he will cntn to provide dvc on the board in this role and then of crs we very much invite him to share his experience in sporting mttrs, said Grndl.
At the same time, he dd not want to speculate as to whthr or nt Lahm could succeed him as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the scandal over the photos taken by Mesut Özil nd Ilkay Gündogan with the Trksh President Recep Tyyp Erdogan, Grindel xprssd a preference for a national team player without an immigration background to fll the position of DFB ambassador for integration.
Currently, this position is filled by native Brzln Cacau and Celia Sasic, who trcs her family bck to Cameroon.
If somebody without a migration background is an obvious influencer in scty and football and says, ‘ the issue is an important one, we need to do something about it ’, ‘ this wld ls be an initiative to prvd a bttr foundation fr our local teams, where integration needs to work ’, Grindel sd.

Even actors sch as Hgh Jackman and Forest Whitaker, government representatives, the United Nations and aid organizations appeared on the stage at the spectacle, which lstd fr hours.
There ws a scry moment when many spectators mistook the noise of a falling metal barrier for shots, got scared and tried to run wy.
There was a shrt panic with people running in all drctns.
Seven spcttrs were slightly injured, said organizer Hugh vns.
The New York police and mscn Chris Mrtn calmed the audience from the stage.
Nobody is trying to njr anyone, said Martin.

As every yr, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert wr available free of charge online.
If you wanted to gt n, you had to read and share texts, photos and videos about the global fght against poverty and diseases online.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were chrs and ppls frm the audience - by contrast, Republican Senator Jeff Flake was booed.
Flake did join hs Democratic cllg Chris Coons on the stage in cllng for more equal rights between men and women.
On Frdy, however, Flake hd spoken in the Judiciary Committee of the US Senate spprtng the nmntn of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on the Supreme Court, which offended many women.
At least three women made abuse allegations, including some of attempted rp against Kvngh, who rejects these.
Flake called for an FBI investigation after two women who reportedly experienced sexual sslt thmslvs confronted hm on the way to a committee meeting in an elevator.

Freedom of Press: Fdrl government defends exclusion of journalist
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert has defended th expulsion of a journalist from the press conference of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CD) and Turkish prsdnt Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In th chancellery, the Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with th Turkish and German writing “ Freedom for jrnlsts ” nd was sitting in the first row.
The T-shirt ws not the prblm, Seibert said to the Bild on Sunday.
It ws about a dsrptn in the course of the press conference.
The journalist ’ s action created a lot of unrest, which ws nccptbl.
Thus, he rdrd bodyguards to scrt the man out.
Seibert said that it was not prmttd to demonstrate political concerns at press cnfrncs in the federal chancellery.
no matter if it is a lgtmt cncrn or not.
The rules r the rules.
In Turkey, many journalists r imprisoned.
Mny of them r accused of alleged espionage or supporting or being members of prohibited parties or the Fthllh Gülen movement.
The Turkish government holds the movement responsible fr th failed attempted coup on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists r facing several decades in jl.
Even frgn journalists are not safe from Turkish authorities: At the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Mx Zirngast was rrstd.
Most recently, th css of the incarcerated journalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They wr released and were able to return to Grmny, but th legal processes in Turkey against the two are still ongoing.
Munich: Florian David Ftz completely drunk with Ina Müller
Hs fans normally know him to be so fresh nd good looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look twice, though: Yes, that's rlly Florian David Ftz.
Th popular actor ws in Hamburg - and he had a wild night!
Hmbrg - The talk show “ Inas Nacht ” [Ina's Nght] produced by NDR is known fr its cheery cnvrstns at the bar of the Hamburg port pub “ Schellfischposten . ”
Moderator n Müller often cheers her guests with a beer, some wine or vn stronger beverages to loosen up the mood nd their tongues.
Quite a few clbs ls need the liquid courage for the obligatory vocal number.
Another episode of the popular tlk shw was recorded on Friday.
This time: The actor Florian David Fitz known frm films like "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr rtl" or "Der geilste Tg".
Th trip didn ’ t do the actor ny good, though.
On Saturday, he posted a selfie - his fc cmpltly crumpled, only two small slits for eyes.
The bd selfie shwd a completely drained Florian David Fitz.
But he is not ill, he only hs qt a hangover.
Addressing hs fans, he posted some - probably not entirely srs - insights he learnt: "Rule one: NEVER go to Inas Nght.
Rule tw: Nvr drink "die schwarze Sau".
And Sprtz.
And also pass on Ina ’ s round of eggnog at hlf past tw."
The long nght is really showing on the 43-yr-lds ’ face.
His fans posted a couple of tps fr getting rid of a hangover.
They ranged from instant broth, fish sndwchs or - probably th most effective - painkillers.
Others simply njyd th sight of the normally attractive movie star.
We still don't knw how Ina Müller survived the binge drinking at nght.
Since sh has hosted the wild TV fn at the bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to be much bttr prepared ...

Treysa hs struggled against vandalism and garbage
Accessing th 36-kilometer cycle track in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is very difficult nd heavily littered.
Attempts r made to remedy the rampant vndlsm, but there are hardly any signs of solutions.
Shards, cigarette butts, garbage nd rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and nw dismantled sgns - so for quite some time presents itself the entrance with seating area to the bike path on the Hß-hll in Treysa.
The sight of the bcycl path, which is the flgshp object in Rotkäpchenland, is more than inglorious.
The matter is of concern to the ADFC (German Cyclists Association) chapter Schwalmstadt, but others hv ls taken ntrst for some time, according to the city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstnhgn.
The problem hs already been ddrssd by the bicycle traffic advisory body.
Thr is no solution so far.
Suggestions ranged from transferring th stng area to the rglr emptying of garbage cans, and cleaning the point of entry areas.
I thnk, th latter would be the order of th day, irrespective of any further activities, says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) sys he ls brought the issue up with the local advisory council.
Not only the rubbish is a nuisance for cyclsts and residents - on weekends the seating group is a regular mtng place fr partying.
It is not just about the noise, there are ls disturbances d to parties: Posts pulled out of the ground, grbg cns wrecked, signs snapped and seating daubed.
Frequently volunteers have already cleaned up, explains th ADFC mmbr Susanne Klippert.
Actions are only proverbial drops in the cn.
They are annoyed that the rest area at the cycle trck in Treysa is a mtng point for binge-drinking.
Clearly the focus point along the entire bike path is here on th Haaße, confirms the cycling commissioner, who now is also rspnsbl for the cycling site in Zgnhn, which will be pnd today.
If it suffers the same fate, it wll cst dearly.
Another d is placing video surveillance on th hill: "Possibly this raises the threshold to engage in dmgng common property.
Hwvr, this wld require a police patrol to come out.
In principle, Wüstenhagen supports th development of the Haaße hll.
It needs to be md more attractive.
So far one can be very satisfied with how well the bicycle pth is frqntd.
It is still possible to develop trsm-rltd marketing.
r cycle track is of very high quality compared to others in German ’, agreed th ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert cnsdrs the situation in the Ascheröder Strss in Treysa to be critically dangerous.
There is no turning lane on Hß Hügel.
In heavy trffc, cyclists my end up waiting in th middle of bidirectional traffic flows", she explains.
That would not be a problem for sporty cyclists, but is for older people and especially fr chldrn.
Music cntst at th culture train station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" and the sea
The first cll to participate in the msc contest was a success, creative and cooperative.
Your Song for Hiltrup is the mtt of the Hiltrup initiative for the "Music Cntst for young nd old, new and experienced musicians."
A contest "with a wnk from th lovely Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke worded it.
In fact, it sn became a fmll togetherness with coffee and cake from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven acts performed, frm a one-man bnd to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Hmbrg with his guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an ld-stblshd Hiltrup man, the "Hltrpr Sternfarben", three members from three generations of the Trenkamp and Cls fmls, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling und die Zwarties.
This contest is a novelty, explains dstrct myr Joachim Schmidt.
We hv not seen something lk this in other districts.
What did the songwriters sing bt?
Particularly popular places wr the Hiltrup lake and Marktallee.
Rolf Ihmig dedicated the sng to th avenue Marktalle in his folk-like song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also mntnd.
Over and vr again, the acts sang about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially Alvin Jsc.
Krl Franke led the audience through th breaks with short interviews with the performers or some information about the rtsts.
Thus, the audience learnt that Humberg that he had ctlly studied chemistry, but now also teaches gtr.
From the sound ngnr Stefan Schemmelmann Franke reported tht he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest as a main ct.
And Alvin Jasic hs uploaded a lot of YTb videos.
It ’ s nt about winning, Frnk had said.
In fact, all prtcpnts received a gift from Hltrp catering businesses.
For th jury's favorites there was something special - so tht others could also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied cn record an ntr CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other musicians can record a song: hmg with his Hiltrup hit, which especially impressed Franke with his msclty, and th “ Lummerland pack: ” “ a very good performance ” wth tn children and two tchrs on guitar and cajón, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Lk everyone else, the children also performed again for the finals - and even without electronic spprt, they sounded "really good," Franke sd.
Th jury ws guided by the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody nd recognition value.
The jury ncldd Gisbert Keller from the Wstphln School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Trade ssctn as wll as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched th vnt on the occasion of its ten-year anniversary.
They considered the event a cmplt success.
Everyone was "very satisfied," and "the atmosphere was good" in the vry crwdd Kulturbahnhof.
Th Word Game: Testing "Decrypto"
The players frm two tms and sit opposite one another.
Fr each page there is a screen, on it there are four cards with keywords tht you can decipher - the old trick with th red foil.
This nsrs the other side cannot rd anything unintentionally.
Fr example, on the cards it says to read frm left to right: "1 . Renaissance.
2 . Fnstr.
3 . Cb.
4 . Sldʺ.
These are the terms that need to be cdd.
So the terms r not guessed, the codes r.
Taking turns, one plyr per tm is the encryptor.
They get a code crd that hs "3.4.2 ." etc . written on it.
In "Decrypto," it is not the words bhnd the secret film tht shld be guessed, but their encryption codes.
The tsk in ths case: They should - in this order and in this example - describe th terms "cube", "solid" and "window" - in such a way that hs own tm recognizes th correct order and the opposing team does not, because the team that cracks the code twice wins th game.
Th encryptor writes down and reads ld: "Thrw" for the dice, "loose" as opposed to "solid". Of course, smthng like "evidence" would be possible or "Prague" because he read sm history bks and knows about the defenestration of Prague.
This thn prgrsss, round for round, team by team.
It is true that one does not knw the terms of the other side - but with vry clue the ncryptr gives, you ’ re closer to finding them t.
So the term should be as mysterious as possible, bt nt t crazy . Otherwise, you make it unnecessarily difficult for your team.
The most cryptic ‘ Decrypto ’ is th precept nfrtntly.
The players hv to study it for quite a lng time and in detail, until thy can finally play it.
Th explanatory video under dcrypt.nf on the web will make it easier.
But once you have started, y ’ ll be amazed at how much emotion there is in this nndscrpt gm.
Overall, hwvr, "Decrypto" is not quite as conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "Codenames", whch ls mks use of the spy theme for a game wth few words, but it ’ s much easier to play in small groups.
nd if it's all about guessing and not about wnnng, it's easy to play a version fr two.
Kulmbach: Mn gives police the Hitler salute and harasses gsts in the pub
During the night from Saturday to Sunday a 48 year ld man gave th plc station in Kulmbach twice something to do.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a pssng police ptrl in the upper town, ltr he was also fnd in the upper town in a pub where he harassed other guests.
After clearly under the influence of lchl he did not comply with the plc order to vct the premises, he had to spend the night in the detention cell in th police station of Kulmbach.
In the sober state, he also had to tk lgl responsibility fr the use of symbols of unconstitutional organisations.
Th Pressig depotwas home to the thrust locomotives
For decades th depot in Pressig was th hub of the Franconian Forest.
1991 pt an end to a piece of railway hstry.
Th crashing from bmpr to bumper could be heard throughout Pressig, remembers Georg Dinkel, wh archives the history of the place and the stations.
Ths did not bother anybody.
The squeaking of brks and rttlng of carriages could also be heard.
This was pure rlwy.
Statements that r symblc for Dinkel ’ s Pressig homeland.
Nowhere in the Franconian forest has a plc been chrctrzd by the railway so much.
This was the starting point for the stp mountain section to the nrth, which peaks in Steinbach am Wald following an ascension of bt 220 meters.
Previously trains and lcmtvs hsd in Pressig were needed to handle this.
In 1901 the Bvrn prlmnt approved the building of a depot with 21 locomotives, apprentice workshops, catenary and rlrd maintenance division.
The centerpiece was the turntable, which after reconstruction in th year 1899 had a diameter of 18 mtrs, says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian nd a professional railroader with 47 years of xprnc.
The Prssg depot, which in the year 1968 ws relocated to Bamberg, also prtd locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg nd Kronach - Nordhalben.
On Jly 15 1950 th "Volksblatt" rprtd of a staff of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives were sttnd in Pressig at that time.
Th electrification of the track in 1939 reduced the nd for pulling trains and locomotives.
From 1977 they were still used with frght trains.
By 1991 at lst 10,000 wagons were shunted.
In 1982 the depot was partially dismantled and the rmndr in the yr 1991.
Heidrich: ‘ It ’ s a shame that better s of th location is not envisaged, also with regard to frght traffic ’.
Stll in the year 1989 at Pentecost, the Nuremberg Railway Drctrt clbrtd "50 years of electrification Nrmbrg - Saalfeld" with a pompous station festival for the anniversary in Pressig.
10,000 enthusiastic spectators were here, remembers Georg Dnkl.
Shortly ftrwrds.
On Jn 1, 1991 the lst 30 men were withdrawn and the Pressig marshalling yard was history.
The shunters nd wheel scotches took care of th heaviest rail traffic work, remembers Dinkel.
Each mistake cld have fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen station led to a change in the hrrchy of both locations and how many mr historical and current pctrs there are, is included here in the nfrnknPls article.

It was a little surprising whn Hhn announced his retirement some days ago.
With Tania Engelke nd Kurt Neubauer he put his task in experienced, yng hands with excellent future prospects.
In the past, both have already been actively involved in the slctn of artists and hv hlpd in designing flyers.
Once gn this year thr will be a 70 cent special stamp designed on the ccsn of Knst & Genuss (art and enjoyment), available at every art station.
The poster this year ‘ tdnc th Betzn ’, designed by Volker Hahn, can be prchsd for eight euros.

There was also the “ Rüdesheim wine ” to go with the exquisite grape juice, whch many gsts had in frnt of them.
“ Hmls lupulus, ” which is th Latin name for ‘ hops, ’ references another cool drink.

Volleyball: Women's 3rd Lg: USC II wins hgh-clss derby against BW Aasee
Th promoted team marches on.
Three games, three wins - USC Münster's reserves, under the patronage of Axel Büring, gets on really wll in lg thr.
No trace of shynss or getting the heebie-jeebies . Th independents are doing their thing.
And with th 3-0 (25-15, 25-23, 26-24) against city rivals BW Aasee, thy did really wll.
It wasn't crystal clear, but we have already left an impression, says th reasonably stsfd coach.
BWA coach Kai Annacker mmdtly agreed with him: “ Ths is a defeat that we can live with.
We are nt dissatisfied. ” Quite the contrary.
In the vnng, at Ronja de Boer ’ s bltd birthday party, the mood was good, the game ws done.
Ys, the result is in fct an optical illusion.
In the third set, th guests had a st ball.
If you brng it to the finish, such a game cn also tip over quite sly, Büring knows from years of experience.
Ultimately USC made everything clear with ts experienced players nd finished it out.
We all know who is on the thr side in sch a derby.
Tht was not our undoing.
I've seen a great game of vllybll at times, Annacker dd not strggl with the 0-3 and went straight back to the agenda.
After just three matchdays, it does not seem foreseeable where the independents ’ jrny gs.
It ’ s simply too early for that, says xl Bürng.
He nly feels vindicated in one thing: “ Th 3rd Women's League has an unbelievably good lvl of play.
It ’ s not even close with regional league vllybll. ” They don't even wnt to lk down towards the fourth league.
If they don ’ t wnt to lose hope, they have to lk up.
But a cnclsn can't be drawn until after ten or lvn games.
Th next game is at Emlichheim on Saturday.

bt her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller did not feel she was enough for hr husband
The "Dream Shp" made Hd Keller a star.
Now she speaks openly tht the srs could have had some influence on her divorce with Hans von Borsody.
Heide Keller (76) bcm famous in her role as chief hostess Btrc von Ledebur on the ‘ Drm Boat ’, but on 01 Jnry 2018 she disembarked forever.
Th series that md her a star might be one of th reasons of her failed marriage to Hans von Brsdy (1929 - 2013), to whom she had been married for ten years.
This could also hv been a reason.
Because this wrk became a part of me, I traveled around th world with a suitcase alone and many of my admired colleagues treated me as equal, xplnd Keller in th ntrvw to "Bild am Sonntag".
Sh used to be "the wf of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the "Drm Ship".
Because now journalists called her only as Hd Keller.
I don ’ t know if he ws happy wth this.
She thinks that it possible that her husband might have bn jealous at th time, but "as many men Hans ws afraid of talking about problems and flngs."
Keller lwys made effort for Hans von Brsdy "and he did not want to dscvr my fears and my weaknesses.
In plain language it means: I ’ m pretending," as she xplns frthr.
She lwys had the feeling of ‘ not bng enough for him.
He saw in me an mncptd woman, which actually I never was, even though I sometimes pprd cheeky nd courageous on stage.
I wanted our lv to last forever ’.
ftr a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, Keller said ‘ Yes ’ again, ‘ lthgh I was scrd it could go wrong again ’.
Th day before the civil marriage, I sat in the chngng room crying and wanted to cancel everything.
Th marriage to von Borsody failed as well.
Why dd it never work out with men?
Because I wntd too much.
Kllr was in love at that time "as in th movie.
nfrtntly, this vsn is not compatible with daily life.
I am t naive to approach love."
The moth, wh regularly explores the city nightlife in th NZZ Zurich area, has now ttmptd this on the ZFF opening party.
Not really a moth, just a lttl shady.
And the shiny glare, in which a grn carpet is bathed in, on th Sechseläutenplatz, blinds him over the chrg.
It is th film festival though, where the mr or less famous want to bathe in the spotlight.
So this late Thrsdy evening he tttrd across the square, to briefly relieve hmslf in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of th pblc toilet complex sponsored by a large sanitary company, whch is being premiered at the festival: The public convenience on th ground floor of a new pavilion tries hard to create a luxurious mbnc.
This evening, whtvr the rsn, it literally stinks in the gents area.
So out of here, over to the other side of the street: Invited guests, wh were entertained at th best level at the cinema next door with the opening flm "Green Bk", like vry year celebrate the opening of the festival with a party in the three-storey department str.
Its name fits perfectly wth ths film festival: It is well known that the wrks shown originate from the whole globe.
What do you have to cm up with when writing an article about this festival, so as not to fall into hidden dvrtsng for ts 190 partner companies.
Th moth binds a ribbon around the feelers that a fairy gdmthr has snt him, and two beefy doormen generously let him pass inside.
Inside, the invited are crwdd together, they dnc wy past midnight to live music or ccpt rhythms dictated by the DJ, to which they shout at each other, nd rinse exquisite appetizers down with a glass of champagne.
In the delicatessen in the bsmnt oysters await slurping mouths, nearby th unparalleled Culatello di Zibello raw ham is freshly cut, and a chocolate fountain bbbls.
And the highlight is: tht th shp shelves have not been cleared of the exclusive products for the event.
It has been lk this for years and seems to function wtht any major losses.
You must just love th country for it!
The moth studies th sign by the escalator: "Please be careful on the scltr if you are wearing a lng dress".
Should this be two separate nstrctns, he has ignored the drss code.
Hwvr, it is a conditional cnstrctn that has undoubtedly saved lives.
In th hshld goods dprtmnt on the upper floor, the winged man tips down a cocktail made with sprss called "Golden Eye", which is suited to the festival award.
The mixture getting the prize for the bst drink, presented by a capsule manufacturer - nt compulsory.
nd George Clooney, wh has been advertising for the brand mentioned for years, is ls not there on the evening.
There is n face, however, between local notables, cash desk and ktchnwr, that is fmlr to th spectators: Peter Farrelly, Director of the opening film.
Its main character will not be far wy.
And in reality: Immediately, Viggo Mrtnsn, wh is almost sixty walks thrgh the crowd appearing almost like a choir boy.
He is not talked nt, nt gaped at, at the most he receives stealthy glances.
Ths restraint, easily mistaken for inhibition, is why the international stars love ths film festival.

Munich - In times of digital "fast-food dating" by Tinder and other dtng pps, the supermarket xds an almost anachronistic romance as a place to meet ‘ the n ’.
Yeah, right . If in doubt, talking about discounted trky mt, boxer shorts at the rmmg table, or your fvrt pudding is still a better story for your future grandchildren than a mere right swipe.
The pp Tinder has the reputation of being less of a place to meet, but rather mr of lewd xchng.

Here is th amazing result.

Ftbll: District League: Strong appearance of VfL Wolbeck gnst the SC Altenrheine gives hope
Thr were moments in this yng season, when Alois Fetsch was really hard on his team.
Silently, the coach of the football dstrct league club VfL Wolbeck first rtrtd (nwrdly) to ponder over the lack of motivation on the playing field.
All is hstry.
Mnwhl, the game is on at Brandhoveweg.
The 1:1 on Sunday against SC Altenrheine proved so, and they almost got prmtd past ssn.
Yes, I am very happy with th appearance.
We made tightened spcs and pt pressure on the ball.
That was smthng to be proud of, prsd Fetsch hs boys and went to each of his players individually after the game to simply say "thnk you" for the great defense against the ambitious guests.
The coach had to chng the systm after 26 minutes.
Following Nico Frerich's injury (muscular problems) - for hm came Luca Rhbrg - the 4-4-2 almost smlssly changed into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes ws in the front line waiting for passes to him.
Wolbeck had much mr time of possession in the frst half.
nd more opportunities
But Frrchs (17), sbsttt Luca Rehberg (26m) and Jan Schroer (38th) missed th lead.
It almost backfired when SC ’ s very own Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer made two dangerous attacks against Wolbecker in minute 41, but goalie Dmn Hallas proved to be a mstr of his trd.
After halftime, VfL boldly tk complete control.
Thewes just brly failed with a shot frm 18 meters.
Schroer was too lt in minute 58 when Thewes pssd him the ball.
Fetsch decided to freshen up the team on the lft wing and put in Mls Geske.
As Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer cut down Robin Wsths in minute 70, th home team got an indirect free kick 18 meters away frm the goal.
The fld player himself stppd up and demonstrated how dangerous he can be in set play situations.
Westhues kicked the ball wth his strong right and the goalie had to face the fact that he hd fld: 1:0 (minute 71).
With 20 mnts left on the clock, the game smd to last forever.
Bcs then this happened: In minute 80, VfL captain Florian Qbck accidentally touched the bll in the box.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hmm) immediately pointed to the pnt.
Jannis Schndr was not ready to miss ths opportunity (minute 79).
Wolbeck had to endure long minutes in the final stage, when Geske finally managed to finally get tht ball into th goal and secure th winning gl in minute 87.
That mght have been overkill.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Qbck, Bodin, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th minute Seidel), Bnsmnn - Frrchs (26th minute L. Rhbrg), Wsths, Vielmeyer (66th minute Geske) - Thewes

llBrght Foundation Report: Women cntn to be a rarity on executive boards
Only 8 percent of board mmbrs were female as of September 1, according to the report "The Power of Monoculture," officially launched this Mndy by the AllBright Foundation, an advance cpy of whch had been made available to th German Press Agency.
The companies will have to make changes, otherwise ntrntnl cmpttrs will leave them bhnd, said foundation CEO Wiebke Ankersen.
In the US, UK, or Swdn, ml-nly management teams have - with a few xcptns - been unthinkable for some time.
The gap makes the German competitors less diverse, nnvtv, and future-oriented by cmprsn.
It is a different corporate cltr.
The slight increase in the number of women in German lstd companies cn be specifically attributed to the positive boost from companies in the mid-cap ndx (MDax).
Yet according to Allbright dt, nly 6.8 percent of boards are female.
In th previous yr the value was still at 3.8 percent.
mng the 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - th proportion of women stagnated.
Most rcntly, there were 26 wmn working on the boards.
I am sure tht Dax companies will be recruiting women mr consistently in the coming year - it is in their wn best interest, said Ankersen.
Only RWE nd Heidelberg Cement showed no commitment to increase the “ zr percent ” to date.
The supervisory boards paint a different picture: As of Sptmbr 1, the prprtn of women was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fwr men than a year g.
If multiple women wr recruited to th boards every year, a percentage of 40 prcnt would be achieved in 2023, it says in the report.

Against West Hm United ManU looses 1:3 . Th way of defeat certainly will remain a matter of discussion.
The scene in the 74th mnt, when rcvrd Marko Arnautovic scored for West Ham 3:1, was symbolic; only three minutes after Marcus Rshfrd appeared to bring the Red Devils back nt the game.
As th team sspctd an offside in the pass by Mark Nbl, all of Mnchstr ’ s defensive players froze in position, giving Arnautovic all th time in the world to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative clmx of a vry inadequate performance over long stretches.

Füchtorf's Home ssctn celebrates a major festival: The milk comes after th apple
And Borisch was also ctv on the actual day of ctn.
She provided her hungry gsts with frshly made apple pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused a big amount of ntrst.
He hd his apple press in his luggage and demonstrated th lf of an apple to his astonished spectators step by step from the ripe apple to apple juice.
Every now and then, Hartmann-Niemerg had hlp from the chldrn to fill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little mscl power, th apples became a finely chopped mass.
Not mny of the children could imagine how a tasty drink was to be md from it.
But they could even witness this important step on th late Friday ftrnn.
Packed in molds nd wrppd in nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer by layer, which looked a bt like chopped shreds.
Thanks to certain technical support, the last wrk step was now no longer so dffclt.
The frshly pressed juice gradually ran nt a big vessel.
But the Füchtorf farmer ls hd bottled specialties with him.
So he pnd his “ treasure chest ” nd presented the ltst Federweisser [alcoholic beverage] to the older visitors.
There ws a lot of demand for the good “ Made in Füchtorf ” bvrg.
In a cmfrtbl atmosphere, the parents got to talking while the children were nt nly bl to follow the process of pressing apples, but also discovered the bouncy castle that had been set up.
Active members of the Füchtorf comradeship of former soldiers wr also involved in the festival and invited people to jn in fun games at svrl stations.

1:4 against Frankfurt: Hnnvr facing fourth wsht this season: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt / Main After their fourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered hs disappointed players from Hnnvr 96 and gave them crg.
However, there were nt many positives to take wy frm the bottom team ’ s earlier 1:4 (0:2) result at Eintracht Frankfurt.
It is a crappy sttn, but you have to come out on the other side as a team, said 96 plyr Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "This is of course disappointing, because y always try for the best rslt pssbl".
Victory continues to elude the players frm Lower Saxony, for whom only Flrnt Muslija (86 .) scored to narrow the gap . They remain at the bottom of the table with only tw points and must be considered a rlgtn candidate in thr current form.
By contrast, an xcllnt Ante Rebic led Frnkfrt to celebrate their first home win of the season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in th 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Gzmán (59th) nd Luka Jvc (89th) scored for the DFB Cup winners in front of 46,300 spectators . After th successful dress rehearsal for the Europa League match against Lazio, Frankfurt move into the mddl of the table on svn points.
Croatia ’ s Vice World Champion Rebic was involved in almost vry dangerous ffnsv move by the Hessians at hs starting eleven debut while Hannover ’ s defense struggled to rgn him in.
Th striker battered after the World Cp, showed by his tempo and assertiveness why he is so valuable fr Eintracht.
Besides Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, on ln from Lvrpl FC, was called up to Frankfurt ’ s starting eleven for the first tm and the team got off to a dynamic strt.
Th first sign of danger came in the frm of Lucas Trró ’ s header (17th), which was deflected into the netting.
Six mnts later, Sébstn Haller was stopped by 96 ’ s defense in a promising position . Th defenders wr led by the Brazilian Felipe, in for Kevin Wimmer, who suffered a last-minute back injury.
The hm side ’ s lead was all but inevitable and completely jstfd.
After a defended corner kick, Filip Kostic lifted the ball into the bx and Haller headed it in front of th gl, whr Ndicka only had to tap it in.
It was the frst Bundesliga goal for the defender from French second division team AJ xrr who had joined th club during the summer.
nd Frankfurt increased the tally before the break.
This tm, Haller passed to his fellow strkr Rebic, who skillfully dribbled through the lines leaving 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no chnc.
At half-time Hannover Coach Breitenreiter rctd to the weak performance of his eleven and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Wydndt, two nw attackers.
The Lower Saxony side showed mr courage gng forward but could not come up with any dazzling ideas until just before the nd of the match whn they at least managed to score and narrow the gap.
The Hessians were much mr efficient.
After just under an hour Rebic started a solo nd then crossed to De Guzmán, who jst tapped the ball into th empty goal.
Playing against overstretched guests, Frnkfrt could take it easy fr the rst of the match, which also saw Jovic scoring with one minute to go.

Geisingen: Christians in Geisingen celebrate the Holy Cross fstvl
Catholics in Geisingen celebrate the Holy Crss festival on September 14 or on th Sunday after.
The festival service takes place at the twn church, fllwd by a procession to the Church of the Hly Cross with the blessing.
At the Church of the Holy Cross lies Chrsts, who witnessed the Thrty Years' War and is said to have been shot by a Swdsh soldier.
Blood flowed frm the gunshot wound.
This rsltd in a great pilgrimage to th Christus' resting place, which then led to the construction of the Church of the Holy Crss.
The construction is not fnshd yet, nly the snctry is, the missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Fthr dlf Buhl reminds us that th cross is a sign of hope, comfort and life.
Inspite of the importance for the Gsng parish, attendance ws rather poor.
ftr the service, the procession to the Chrch of the Holy Cross took place and the final blessing concluded th ecclesiastical part of the cross festival.
Th Catholic church choir has been inviting people to the sclr part of th festival in the Catholic parish home for many years.
The choir members prvdd visitors with hearty food and a big slctn of cakes and, pprprt for the weather, farm-fresh ice cream.
In the afternoon, the prsh offered guided tours around the city church, Bernd Bendschneider and Petra Schmd-Sgr informed the visitors on behalf of the prsh about the dmg to the facade, rf, the sandstone works and windows and the upcoming construction, which wll last until next year.
After the scffld hs been standing for some time, the damage could be more accurately determined and the individual calls for bids could be prepare more cncrtly.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive thn planned, because the already existing damage hase worsended over the last few yrs, but also more damaged has been uncovered, whch was only possible through the inspection by means of th scffld.
The plinth plastering work is completed and before the winter, the natural stn wrk will begin and th involved parties hope to finish about hlf of this work this year.

In 2016, excavators started rllng to demolish the hs.
The new bldng was to be dsgnd to be as welcoming and brght as possible, so that the residents could feel comfortable in it, says the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new rsdntl home
The lf aid invested approximately 4.6 million r in the new construction.
The state of Bavaria cntrbtd 2.4 mlln Euros, the district of Swabia 450,000 Euros.
According to architect Bdr, the cnstrctn work has remained within the planned framework - both in terms of time and fnnclly.
The Lebenshilfe ’ s managing director Jürgn Heinz thanked Bader ths accomplishment.
Th blnc between a barrier-free and fireproof design has not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners nd handymen built a home with many specifications, to allow residents the freedom to move vn wtht outside help.
The same was expressed by th head of social services in the Schwaben district, Gertrud Kreutmayer: ‘ The home is geared towards the special requirements of ts rsdnts, who need help wth mobility ’.
Comfort and fnctnlty have been combined to gd effect in the process, said Kreutmayer.

All in all, th new residential home on Münsterblickstrasse houses 30 people wth disabilities on almost 1,500 square meters, divided nt three residential groups.

Germany: Schwesig complains about differences btwn East and West
Berlin - Prior to the anniversary of German unification, the vice-president of the SPD, Manuela Schwsg, appealed to the ntn not to resign themselves to the dscrmntn of East Grmns.
There are differences tht hurt ftr almost 30 years of unity
We can nt permit ourselves to be satisfied with these differences, ” said the mnstr president of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern to the “ Tagesspiegel ” on Sndy.
The goals mst remain the same: to create equal living conditions across th country.
It is unacceptable tht East Grmns work longer on average than people in Western Germany, but receive 15 percent lss salary.
This is inexplicable, nrly 30 years after the German Unification, said Schwsg.
North Korea: Is this ct dog going to end the Korean cnflct?

A new week, a new opportunity fr the government
Back to regulatory work - this is the nffcl motto for the working week of th grand cltn starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech in which the Chancellor and her ministers from th CDU, SPD and also lastly from th CS did not invoke th mantra "return to work".
That may hv led sm craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working people in this country to the legitimate qstn of wht the difference really is between work and paperwork, but that's all.
Nw the federal government is ready to devote itself again to the task of governing, they should not be distracted frm this nw with debates on terminology.
Whether nn nd SPD can pull off something together after the provocations and disgraces of recent wks, will possibly be seen on Monday.
The leaders of th governing parties will come tgthr for the coalition committee in the evening.
Chancellor Angela Mrkl now wants to summon this session rglrly, to defuse conflicts early on; lessons cn be learned from all the disputes.
First of all, however, cnflct-ldn topics r on the agenda again with the dsl retrofits and the skilled labor immigration law.
CSU Trnsprt Minister Schr wants the car companies to get off lghtly with an exchange premium - SPD and CDU consider the manufacturers to be under obligation to tchnclly retrofit older diesels.
While over the weekend a rapprochement has emerged in th diesel crisis, the Union and SPD are still fr apart in the planned sklld labor immigration law.
The SPD promotes a long-term perspective fr failed asylum-seekers, who work or who r training.
The Union is strictly against the "track chng" from th asylum system into the labor market.
There wll be disputes amongst the coalition prtnrs again - how could this be otherwise?
Not equal and equal has joined forces to form the grand coalition, but thr prtnrs with sometimes very different images of society and prrts.
Dspt is good.
Wtht dispute, a subscribed society of such diverse, smtms contradictory interests does not progress.
But to be cnstrctv, dspt should not be exaggerated again for party tctcl reasons regarding the question of being or not-being.
It is about pltcs, not theater.
Union and SPD r to argue - but must lwys have th reality of life of the people in view.
What is possible and is of benefit to mny?
Wth this key question, both the diesel and the track change question cn be pragmatically clarified - and confidence thrby regained.
bv all, that is what the people's parties mst now fight for.

Daniela Holzinger wants to investigate this in more dtl.
Srsly, day and night, her legists hd worked on th scl security reform, reported the social minister at the presentation of the reform two weeks ago exuberantly.

Nevertheless, now there r unanswered qstns to acquit Hartinger "of any suspicion."

Colored powder and eggs: Prtsts in Barcelona before th Catalonia ’ s anniversary
The controversial independence referendum took plc on Monday in Ctln.
Bt right before it begun the protests.
The autumn 2017 police operation ws nt forgotten by the separatists.
Barcelona - Shortly before the anniversary of the Catalan ndpndnc referendum on 1 October 2017, in th downtown of Brcln separatists clashed with police.
Among other things Ctln security frcs were attacked by pro-independence activists with clrd powder, as they were trying to prvnt them from approaching the demonstration of National Police and Civil Guards.
Wth the demonstration bt 3,000 police ffcrs from the Policía Ncnl and Guardia Civil police units wanted to honor their colleagues who performed their duties in the polls last year during the illegal referendum.
An attempt to prevent citizens from vtng lead to vlnc.
Th Spanish md reported that the Catalan police formed a chn to keep the separatists and central security forces apart.

Citing th authorities it was said tht six people had been arrested and 24 other were slightly injured.
The independence rfrndm took place fr the first time on Monday.

The frmr regional president Crls Puigdemont has fled to Belgium.
Other pltcns also escaped abroad.
However, several ministers of then regional gvrnmnt and other activists of the separatist movement rmn in custody.
In Dcmbr in the region were held new elections.

Yet th new prsdnt insists on the ‘ Right of self-determination ’ of Catalans.
Ftbll: Oberliga Westfalen: Complete hlplssnss: Goalless match between FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen
Rt-Wß Ahlen still going nowhere.
FC Gütersloh only ddn ’ t gt further than a 0-0 draw.
Th tail lght and the third last of the league demonstrated complete hlplssnss in front of 438 spectators at Heidewald stadium.
Th first half was rather dm in terms of entertainment.
Anyone who wanted to go get a beer or brtwrst could do it without worrying they would mss anything.
Thr was no risk of missing a gl opportunity, because there were virtually none.
The frst shot on gl happened after half an hour.
Responsible fr the frst (harmless) shot on goal was Gütersloh ’ s Nick Flock in minute 28.
The best - and in prncpl only real - opportunity had the team from Ahlen, when FCG glkpr Frederic Westergerling saved Cihan Yilmaz ’ shot on goal from the edge of th pnlty area in minute 32.
The hosts were vn more harmless.
Their most effective action was an early sbstttn.
Striker Lars Schrödr had to be replaced due to injury . Sinan Aygün rplcd him.
ftr the substitution, both teams dcdd to do something against the growing boredom.
In minute 48, Sebastian Mützel shot just over the goal from 18 meters nd after one hour the Gütersloh player also appeared offensive for the very frst tm.
ftr a ball rcptr by Matthäus Wieckowicz, this was quickly dealt with.
Nick Flck (minute 62) "crowned" the quick counterattack over Sinan Aygün wth a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Brnd Schipmann.
In addition, they wnt one better wth a header from Wieckowicz (minute 66) after a crnr from former Ahlen player Tim Manstein.
RW interim cch Angelo Dt responded, substituting Martin Fuhsy for Marko Onucka (minute 60) and a little ltr Sebastian Mützel for Enes Güney (minute 70).
Tht lead to nothing.
The team from Ahlen did not achieve more thn ptcl superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have th last chance, but tht did not get them nywhr.
Angelo Dt tried to emphasize the positive afterwards: "I like that we kpt a clean sheet ." But unfortunately, both sds scored zero.
We were not as dangerous against goal in this match as gnst Holzwickede, even though our opponents did not wnt to ply hr, states RW Ahlen ’ s interim coach.
Offensively, "everything just happened somehow" against a team tht "jst wanted to defend.
At any rt, I did nt feel that we could concede a goal," said Daut.
To his chagrin, hwvr, the viewer did nt fl like his team could score a goal, either.
The performance was too poor for tht.
Thnksgvng Market in Reckenfeld: Good thing there are ngh Kreimers
That is gd news for Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann, nd Elke Frtzlr from the Reckenfeld food bank, for whom these donations are intended.
The volunteers clarify: "These donations wll remain in Rcknfld."
At the opening the sky was a brilliant blue, bt the sqr was a little empty, which was to change vr the day.
Because: "It is such a friendly tmsphr, that is why we are hr today," sd one visitor.
Organizer of the festival Franz Josef Holthaus wlcmd th gsts in a Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a bit of humor.
At short notice, Ferdi and Mrcl Kreimer stood in for the Brockmanns, wh were to be weighed gnst food.
Frd Kreimer ’ s daughter Verena had fallen ill.
But there are enough Krmrs anyway.
And th "substitute" insisted on musically entertaining the vr increasing number of visitors.
This was so wll received that people sng along to some folk songs late at night.
Just great, said a dlghtd Marcel Kreimer.
This year, mayor Ptr Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the opening date in hs schedule.
He is happy to see so many nggd people manning their stnds, most of them hailing from clbs and associations.
Strctly speaking, there shld be no need for things like fd banks, he said when thanking the men ’ s choir for their efforts.
Andreas Hajek prsd everybody ’ s engagement, in the stands, nd also included th additional festivals that took place in September and the ‘ clean-up ’ action.
Our garden city is getting a clrfl coat of pnt - things are really happening.
Next, the wreath was taken down from the maypole by Georg Knorr and Grd Klück with the help of the fire department and taken nt wntr storage.
Many stnds worked to provide sustenance.
Everything frm sweet to savory was available.
Stfn Hagemeyer, who has been living in Reckenfeld fr a year, was creative about his scroll saw.
He offered veneer designs and br mats with typical Reckenfeld mtfs, among other things.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a special treat: "Reckenfeld honey", brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Chrstn Wedershoven and Hln Rth-Bschschlütr.
Th latter has another specialty on hand.
Gingerbread in a glass, wth honey from my own production of crs.
Little Elsa kept coming back for seconds, tht is how good the ck was.
It is this friendly atmosphere that makes visitors stay lt into the evening hours even in th absence of stage events, which are not prt of th fall festival.
Graffiti wth a local political mssg: Unsuccessful advertising for a skate park
In Lengerich, unknown people have advocated fr the construction of a skate park in a hrdly beneficial way.
In several places, there are graffiti, says Jürgen Kohne of the cty dmnstrtn on the request of th WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint fr property dmg has been filed with the police.
The three words "Skatepark fr Lengerich!" are displayed in lrg letters on signs, among others at the Gempt-Halle and th Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the hall, rprts that writing was fnd on the advertising sign on th staircase to the Gempt Bistro on September 19 after the career chc fair.
Since the short message was apparently "only" md with a marker, it could sly be removed.
A few days later, it was thr gn, but this time it was spryd on, says Rottmann.
He assumes tht th respective advertising sign has to be replaced.
Ths cs is special by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich are mentioned on the board.
If the skate park is blt, its realization will also be made possible by spnsrs.
There are already pledges, xplns Jörg Hsslmnn from the urban department of schools, sports and culture, without nmng names.
It is possible, however, tht one or more of the sponsors r identical to those companies tht are on the graffitied board.
For years, local politics and administration have been dlng with the tpc of a skate park.
After the old had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the srch for an alternative lctn began.
The cncl finally chose the fire department parking lot.
However, this rqst was not implemented - apparently, t many factors were gnst a construction at this point.
At the end of Jn, it was all trnd around again.
Members of the main and financial cmmtt now voted unanimously for the r of the Gutenberg school.
Regarding the state of affairs, Jürgen Khn says tht the dmnstrtn is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
Then, city council hs the last word.
He assumes a decision will be reached ths year, so that park cn be built in 2019.
Bottlenecks in air traffic control are getting even wrs
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the chaos ffctng European air trffc in the smmr, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
This year it was nly wnd, 2019 we will have strong wind nd the storm will hit after tht, head of the German air traffic union, Matthias Ms, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
He said that the well known stff shortages plgng European air traffic controllers are an important reason fr th numerous delays and flight cancellations and that there is no quick fix to this problem.
Airlines and airports can make quick improvements for the cmng year, but trnng new air traffic controllers takes fr to five years, the unionist said.
He added tht there are hardly any fully trained r traffic controllers available on the European market.
He pointed out tht the Krlsrh center monitoring Grmny ’ s upper air space alone is short of some one hundred staff.
Maas gn criticized the fact tht different air transport trade unions were not invited to the summit.
Representatives from federal nd stt governments, air traffic controllers, the airlines, and the airports gather on Friday to tackle the css of the delays.
If you wnt to talk about additional work nd overtime, that will not work wtht us, said the hd of the German air traffic nn, many members of which work for the federally owned German air traffic control company DFS.
Ms again held the EU Commission ’ s gdlns responsible for the air traffic control predicament.
He asserted that traffic forecasts fr the regulatory period up to 2019 had bn far too low.
The resulting cost targets and prsnnl savings at the national air trffc control services now have a severe impact on dly operations, he stressed.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to promote regulations in Brussels that wld nt "keep on dprvng air trffc controllers of oxygen".
He cautioned that, as things stnd, the EU targets would be coordinated by 2024 and frthr tightening is to be xpctd.
According to Maas, th EU is exposed to constant lobbying prssr from the airlines.
Ryanair boss, Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now reaped xctly what they hv sown in rcnt years, said Maas.
He hopes that th high costs ncrrd by the airlines as a result of delays will lead thm to think again.
Th German r traffic union would work to improve the situation only if the DFS were to offer a "coherent agreement for future-oriented trnng and dctn," said Maas.
He further ntd that the previously announced intake of 120 r traffic control students per year over the next five yrs is just enough to compensate for age-related prsnnl reductions.
It does not yet ddrss the necessary staff expansion.

Better salaries nd appreciation of colleagues
The police had wntd to pay tribute to their cllgs who had opposed the independence referendum in Ctln banned almost exactly a year ago by the Spanish central government.
They demanded better salaries at th same time.
Members of the Spanish police and th Guardia Civil thought it ws unfair that Catalan and Basque police ffcrs were earning much more than they were.
The demonstrators found it prvctv that the Spanish police dmnstrtd in Barcelona of all places.
Why did they come here to prtst? The 55-year old Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez asked the nws agency FP.
Simply to provoke and to clbrt the fact that thy worked us over a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who said hs name is Daniel, rejected the ccstn.
Of course we want to spprt our comrades wh were only doing their job a year ago: defending the law, he sd.
But the dmnstrtn is here to enforce our rights and we 'r doing it in Brcln, bcs it is a major European city and there is more echo here.

Football: Juventus trainer applauds the top game: Ronaldo ’ s bst gm
Th Portuguese star striker ‘ this evening played the best gm in addition to Valencia ’ s half hour ’, commended Juventus coach Mssmln llgr ftr the 3:1 (1:1) victory of the record champion against SSC Napoli.
For the coach, th expensively purchased star without scoring himself was the decisive man of the match in the important gm against th pursuers.
Ronaldo had a lt of fun and did it well, said llgr.
Even if we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very gd with our first goal and we just got better frm thn onwards.
Thanks to Ronaldo ’ s three assists, Juve struck bck in the game after being down early through the goal by Dries Mertens (10th Minute) nd in the thick of things th prsr was put ff for the time being.
The goal-getter brought in from Madrid first tackled the former Bundesliga professional Mr Mandzukic, who provided a double scr (26./49 .) for th lead.
nd Ronaldo provided the build-up with a head ball from a corner shot, for the goal by the defence leader Lnrd Bncc (76), who just had to make a short psh in, in frnt of the goal line.
He gvs a lot, said the trainer.
But naturally llgr will also see goals frm the attacker, who is the record goal scorer in both the Champions League and in the Portuguese national tm.
We hv to get better at serving hm, the coach said.
Currently Mandzukic is th best Juve scorer with fr goals - Ronaldo has three.
The sprrty of Juventus seems even mr overwhelming, with the prchs of Ronaldo, for more than 100 million Euros.
Seven wins in seven games is the flwlss series in Series A . With 21 points the masters vr the past seven years already have a sx-pnt lead vr Napoli.
The scnd team in the table, coached by the former Bayer cch Carlo Ancelotti, was not without chncs against Turin.
The top mtch was however decided at the ltst after the dismissal of the already warned Mario R (58 .).
Th Portuguese after a too strong pile in against Paulo Dybl had to leave the field with a yellow-red.
We played wll against a good Napoli, the Trn coach commented.
Emre Can shld also feel addressed.
Th German national has asserted himself at Juve.
The prfssnl, who came frm Liverpool, participated in all seven league matches.
The midfielder ls played in the Champions League game against Valencia, which is what Allegri meant by the ‘ hlf hour ’: Ronaldo ws sent off at the 2:0 Turin win and is barred fr th home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.
Kanye West chngs his name

However, the pseudonym is not nws.
The tenth album has pprd under this name.
In an interview wth radio station KRRL the artist explains tht ‘ Ye ’ has a religious sgnfcnc for him.

The SG had nly two options in the first round, but Maik Krs used the first from an acute angle to secure the rly lead (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have ppd the score, bt after great prprtn work by Krause he missed the ball.
The hosts had only a double opportunity as Moritz Hön fld and Jan Blome also found his master in the Sendenhorst keeper Js Schuhmacher.
After halftime, the guests were even more dominant and had a nmbr of good pprtnts.
Bt Uphus (minute 49), Julian Turl (minute 61) nd Heinz Linnemann (minute 69) all fld.
A hand penalty - Louis Kortenjann had rscd on the goal line with th hand and got th red card - was also not of s for the guests (minute 75).
Only nc Nils Berheide pkd the ball across the line was the game over (81st minute).
We hd previously crtczd ourselves hrd, that was different today than in the last few weeks, was Florian Kraus ’ conclusion.

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular ftbll in Albachten: GW lbrslh falls against Concordia 3-4
I do not know wht to thnk of that, he struggled for words.
We dd not get any access to thm . With ‘ them ’, he allegedly meant the wing players Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, bt probably also all the other green and whites, who made themselves noticeable with thr collective offensive rg.
He could stll laugh: "A filthy win," he said, winking cheekily and then went off . His players, on th other hnd, were relieved to have gotten away with thr points.
Mind you, after a dl between two teams, one of which, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, lbrslh, is fighting for styng in th league.
With understandably mixed feelings, GWA coach Svn Lewandowski lkd back at the 90 minutes.
That was by fr r best performance of the season, he says.
It was phenomenal how we come back from th 0-2 draw and held up against one of the lg's tp teams over the entire match.
Hnc, th more bitter it seems, that they had to go home empty-handed.
Tp scrr Lars Zymner sht his team in the lead with his 12th . Goal this season (minute 24).
He ndd exactly two touches in this game for this gl.
The 2-0, he st for Fabian Fröhning (mnt 39).
We knew it, but you jst can't completely take out a player lk that.
It was amazing what he dd, Lewandowski ungrudingly recognized the opponent ’ s qlty.
Just before switching sides, his own team managed to score the equalizer: McGll ’ s free kick from the left sd sailed between Hövlmnn and Cncrd goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long goal corner (45th minute).
After switching sides, it was McGill again who scrd the equalizer (59th mnt).
And thn it went back and forth.
It was a crsp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten (minute 64), just five mnts later Patrick Horstmann qlzd again (mnt 69).
Despite their numerical dvntg, lbrslh was unable to counter the last Concordia goal (minute 80).
Nw, we must focus on Wednesday.
The gm against Schapdetten, that ’ s one we have to win now, said Lwndwsk.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Krögr (87th minute Diallo), P. Hrstmnn, Thale, McGll - Hövlmnn, Bonse (87th minute Bareksai).

Strcl revue: Gender communication from the heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nchrchtn
Tina Tbnr ’ s satirical revue Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck ws "suitable for adults as wll as men".
Comedian Teubner honed in on gender communication with humor nd mpthy for the (stereotypical) woman nd the (stereotypical) man - nd anything else that out there - but also with music.
They plyd mini guitar and also mastered their violins.
Ben Süvrkrüp was manning the piano.
On the one hand, he is the male sprrng partner, who sometimes even gets a word in before the end of the sentence, and on the other, a true pnst: Süverkrüp accompanied Teubner congenially nd in harmony, so mch so that some may hv wshd a solo.
Thn there was this, wth Beethoven and Chopin, but different, so as to ft the theme of the evening.
Tbnr had introduced a paradox: She mused that a man is happy when he hs a partner but does not hold the door pn for her.
But that a clsd dr without a partner, on the other hand, offers no benefit.
The piano solo demonstrated this very notion: Hw would Mozart ’ s career as a composer turned out, if his older sstr "the Nannerl" hd sddnly opened the door?
Thus Süverkrüp slds into improvisations, from Bach ’ s "O Head full of blood and wounds" into th "Death Rattle" Wstrn theme, and from Mozart ’ s G mnr Symphony nt a playful little dance.
There was grt applause and shouts of "brv" from the packed hall.

From cln fruit to ecology
The 125th anniversary of the Dstrct Association fr Gardening and Landscape Conservation was clbrtd with a gala at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On September 29 1893 a fruit show in th Kulmbach community hall set the last mplss for the founding of the Kreisverband für Grtnb nd Landespflege Kulmbach (District ssctn fr Gardening and Landscape Conservation Kulmbach), and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday night, the association celebrated th big anniversary in the Kulmbach Stadthalle (civic centre).
Frnkly the association had a different name at that tm: In the year 1893 the myr Wilhelm Flessa ammounced th name as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (Dstrct Fruit Growing Association Kulmbach City and Country).
The purpose of th fruit-growing association differed from that of today ’ s wrk - in fact, it was purely about fruit grwng nd nobody thought about flowers and gardening at that time.
At tht time, in the r of the Enlightenment, the fruit tree was a favorite child of the lt, explained the lcl history curator Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees lined the hghwys, s-clld industrial gardens were created at schools.
Today fruit cultivation is still the task of the 55 grdnng clubs in th district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7 000 mmbrs.
But by far tht is not the nd of the scope.
Gardening close to nature, biological crop protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a role as ds communicating knowledge bt healthy diets and youth wrk.
The members of th Hutschdorf youth grp "Maulwürfe" (moles) shwd entertainingly on stage how versatile the tasks of a gardening club are.
Youth work is critically mprtnt, especially in th digital age, said Günter Reif, chairman of the district council, and the lord mayor Henry Schramm also mphssd how important experiences in nature are for lf.
Collecting chstnts was for us as children a huge thing, I doubt tht with Smrtphn & Co. it is possible to collect a similar quantity of joy.
Schrmm promised to plnt two trees for the anniversary with district administrator Klaus Peter Söllner.
Where the trees wll be planted will be decided by the district association, ddd district administrator Söllner and mphssd the special importance of th gardening associations for the villages.
The district association stands for clgy, the beauty of the garden and grn spaces in the village.
The fact tht this is a real concern of the many gardening associations in the district, was also stated without dbt by the county mngr nd consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He presented the numerous visitors an illustrated lecture about th long history of th district association and reported among other things, how necessary self-sufficiency ws after the war.
In th old days everything came frm the garden, for the winter conserves were made.
At the end of the 50s, the kitchen garden ws transformed nt an ornamental and live-in garden.
Nature endures, it xstd before us and we must dpt ourselves to it, pleaded the spclst in fruit and nut trees.
There is an ncntv therefore for the gardening associations not to give up, so that our country remains btfl and worth lvng.
Also involved is the wlcmng of new citizens to our associations, explained the Prsdnt of the Bavarian Association, Wlfrm Vaitl.
We must stop the blatant decline in nscts, we owe it to our children nd grandchildren, Güntr Reif concluded the successful ceremony, whch was festively framed by the tower brass musicians of the Thurnau music association.

Protests against presidential candidate Blsnr
Brazilian presidential candidate Jair Blsnr, who was injured in a knife ttck, has been rlsd from the hospital.
According to a report in the dly newspaper "O Glb", the fr-rght ex-military wanted to fly to his hometown Río de Janeiro.
After his release, it is still unclear whether the 63-yr-ld will attend any vnts in the lst week before the presidential elections.
Th politician had been attacked on the strt in early September during an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, in several Brzln cities, thousands of people took to th streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele nã" (English: "Not him"), especially wmn's ssctns protested against the ex-military.
Th associations ls took to social media to protest against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynist statements.
Several thousand dmnstrtrs wr expected in the economic hub São Paulo.
In th capital of Brsl, protests mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers ’ Party (PT), Fernando Hddd.
He tk the pstn of former prsdnt Inácio Lula da Silva, who had been sentenced to twlv years in prison due to corruption and therefore cannot stand for the presidency.
The prsdntl election in Brazil will be on ctbr 7.
As the former mayor of the megacity of São Paulo, Haddad has so far bn bhnd the extreme right candidate Bolsonaro according to plls.
The “ Trump of Brzl ” has bn in politics for a long time, but only recently has prsntd himself as an anti-system candidate.
If none of the candidates reach absolute mjrty in the frst round, thr will be a runoff election on October 28th.
xprts assume that Bolsonaro will not be victorious - no mttr who he is up against.
Bolsonaro is known for bng against gay and black people and for glrfyng the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He shocks the ppl of Brazil with verbal derailments over nd over again.
Once he said that the supporters of Lula's left-wing Labor Party shld be shot dd.

Following a long illness: Danish rck legend died
The Danish rock cn Kim Larsen is dead.
Th singer died on Sunday at the age of 72 following a long illness, shared hs producer Jörn Jeppesen on Larsen ’ s wbst.
Larsen was surrounded on his deathbed by hs wife nd six children.
Since the bgnnng of the year the musician had been under trtmnt for prostate cancer.
Larsen became fms with the bnd Gasolin', which in the 1970s was enormously successful in Scandinavia.
Their songs were influenced by music greats such as Jimi Hndrx, Bob Dylan and the Btls.
In 1978, after the dissolution of th band, Larsen was sccssfl as a solo artist.
He sold bt three million records in Denmark.
His album "Mdt om nttn" from 1983 is still the best-selling album in Denmark.
The Danish Prm Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen on Sndy as a "street by" who was "gnst everything, but in everyone ’ s hearts."
The head of government also recalled tht in the year 2010 the monarchy opponent Larsen performed on th occasion of the 70th birthday of the Dnsh Queen Margrethe II.
A night of rck in the sh factory: Loud as a jackhammer
Here we stnd, taking the bone saw and igniting a cncrt evening with the strength of a tiger . Th band names Hr We Stand, Tiger Bnsw and The Ignition alone suggest such a description of th rocking live music event on Saturday evening in the hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schhfbrk, the community center housed in an old shoe factory: Pure hard rock brought to you by thr bands who are also friends.
After the soundcheck and shortly bfr th start of the concert, th musicians take time for a group photo.
Thr is no hint of stage fright in th process.
Afterwards, th lead singers and their bands from hln and the surrounding area - all of them associated with the Mosquito booking agency from Oelde - vsbly enthrall the pprxmtly 120 visitors of the Mint Mosquito rck night with their loud performances.
Kicking things off, the Tiger Bonesaw quartet rnd frontman and guitarist Dennis Hdrk manages to win the crowd with their ltst, unknown pieces, which the band penned themselves for their sn to be released CD.
In front of the stage, ppl dance to the powerful yet hrmns band performance.
Despite loud clls for an encore, Tiger Bonesaw thn hand vr the reigns to the three-member Here We Stand.
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Gl Meierhenrich on bass, and drummer Kai Hölschr demonstrate th variety within hard rock with their alternative sound, whch is sometimes reminiscent of 1970s classic rock.
Following the high energy rck of the Tigers, Here We Stnd adds a synthesizer on tp of the guitar sound.
Among other titles, the yrnng, almost ballad-like Take Me Hm captivates the audience by switching btwn melodic passages and the guitar-heavy rock reefs typical of th multi-layered songs.
Meanwhile, the quartet The Ignition from Tönnishäuschen have earned a spcl reputation since the bnd formed in 2005.
The bnd presented their full-energy hard rock on Saturday.
It is bvs and unmistakable tht The Ignition have a grt deal of stage experience from thr performances in front of very large audiences - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 2017 China tour.
Playing ff his band, Singer and guitarist Tim Jngmnn has hs very own take on the evening ’ s only cover - Word Up by Cameo frm the 80s.
Mnwhl, it feels like the volume is dialed up vn higher than bfr as guitarist Norbert Brinkmann delivers a solo while running through the cheering crowd.
Of crs, when it comes to hard rock cncrts, a crtn decibel level has to be expected: According to the sound crw, that level was around 98 dcbls for the three band concert with Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw, and The Ignition during the Mint Mosquito nght of rock.
That is approximately the same level as a jackhammer, which is stll significantly lower than th peak volumes at Wacken Open Air festival rfrncd on the band wbst of The Ignition.
However, the Ahlen audience has no nd drng this night of rock for 120 decibel sound as loud as a jet engine, as is cmmn at the heavy metal get together in the nrth of Germany.
After just under four hours, the three hard rock bands hv long since wn the audience over with their confident, expert prfrmnc and own songs.
In the end, ll thr bands can honestly, if figuratively, say: "Here we stnd, having taken th bone saw and ignited a concert evening with the strength of a tiger."
Above all, thy enjoyed th plentiful applause from the audience.

Trump drs Km: "And then we fell in love"
It is no secret that the US Prsdnt is wll disposed towards Nrth Korea ’ s ruler Kim, despite the nuclear crisis.
Now Trump hs made a real declaration of lv to his colleague.
Ths is also linked to Kim ’ s ‘ wonderful lttrs ’.
At the tender age of 72 yrs, th married US president has a new flame.
Th tragic thng is: It is a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, in total public, Dnld Trump made an unusual dclrtn of love to the North Krn leader Kim Jong Un.
Supporters in the US federal stt of West Virginia have heard tender words from Trump for th descendant from the ruling dynasty of Pyngyng half his age, although th struggle for North Korea ’ s nclr disarmament is proving to be a particularly tough job.
I was tough and so was he, it went backwards and frwrds btwn us, reported Trump.
Thn we fell in love.
OK?
No, rlly.
nd not only the conversations with Kim had brght his heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful lttrs, they wr great letters.
Thr personal connection also bore fruit pltclly: Trump pointed to Kim ’ s announced to halt all nuclear and missile tests, vn though critics say it is mr cheap talk.
The US president seemed to be flly aware, that not everyone was fnd of the affection for the notorious martial threats of the "Rckt Man" - so Trump ’ s ncknm for Kim.
He ccptd the expected criticism during hs appearance at a lrg sports hall in the city of Wheeling: ‘ Donald Trump says, thy have fallen in love ’.
How trrbl, how terrible is this?
Tht is so unpresidential.
He crd lttl fr that, said Trump, pointing his fngr at the crowd: "I always told you, it is so easy to be presidential."
But 10,000 people outside would not be srgng into this pckd arena, we would only have 200 people stndng outside.

Lscht urges Turkey to act according to the rule of lw
Cologne - According to the Mnstr President of NRW Armin Laschet (CDU), during hs talks with Turkish President Rcp Tayyip Erdogan, called for the rule of law in Trky.
Th relationships of both countries r currently ‘ vrshdwd ’, Laschet said on Saturday, following a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
These concerns are related to ll the arrest waves, freedom of media and rlgn.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan tht "if in th future relations are going to become normal and if economic relations are going to deepen, then the rule of lw is a very mprtnt condition."
According to Laschet, he also referred to the cases of Grmns bng imprisoned in Turkey.

And we are their cntct persons - and not the Trksh president.
Lck of trust in the US: North Korea demands dsrmmnt
While US President, Trump does not tire of hghlghtng the success of negotiations over North Korea ’ s denuclearization, th st Asian regime is describing rltns more demurely.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a concession from Wshngtn.
North Korea ’ s Frgn Mnstr Ri Yng Ho, speaking at the UN General Debate, hs accused the US government of stalling negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula through continued sanctions.
The recent stndstll has seen th US implementing coercive msrs, which are lethal to trust-building, said Ri in New York.
Disarmament under these circumstance wld be unthinkable for Nrth Korea.
Without any trust in the US, there is no trust in our national security and under such crcmstncs there is no way that we cn disarm rslvs first, th North Korean head diplomat said.
The idea that Nrth Korea could be ‘ brought to its knees ’ due to th sanctions, is ‘ a pipe dream of ppl who dn ’ t know us ’.
To build trust his country has stopped ts atom and missile tsts and has destroyed a nclr test system, Ri said.
However, the S hs shown no "corresponding reactions" to that, the minister criticised.
Last year alone, because of North Korea ’ s nuclear and missile program, th UN Security Council pssd snctns on the internationally isolated country three times.
In recent days th US President Donald Trump nd his Secretary of State Mk Pompeo have been pushing for strict adherence to the sanctions at the United Nations.
Concurrently, th US gvrnmnt is working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first met with Nrth Korea ’ s ruler, Kim Jng Un.
After the first summit in Singapore the US President is aiming for a scnd smmt meeting with Kim.
In October, Pompeo wll be traveling to Pyngyng again for talks about th termination of the North Korean nuclear weapons program.

The fll of Hrth: Overtaken by reality: Bayern calls for Ajax
Th title of nbtbl is gone: The defeat in Brln will not allow the FC Bayern to give up.
The nxt tw classics against Ajax and Gladbach will now determine the interim conclusion fr Niko Kovac ’ s tenure.
Under no circumstances should the first small drop in power with th nw coach Niko Kovaca should increase for Mnch to the autumn minimum.
A week ago, vryn still thght we were unbeatable.
Now we are overtaken by reality, said Thomas Müller ftr the 0-2 dft of Hertha BSC nd asks for a return leg in the Champions Lg duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us, is aware that we r really ngry and that is why we will crnk up on Tuesday.
Fr th first time within more than a year of playing away there were scored no gls, as at th same time tw mandatory preseason games in series without a victory, the league leaders in the Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund.
Th overall situation is not nearly as dramatic as th final phase of the fld Carlo Ancelotti at the end of September 2017, but the champions shall be wr.
Th FC Augsburg with the 1:1 ratio having its long running man-on-man tactics nd th Berlin through its playful pinpricks over the outside have delivered wthn tw days two similar blueprints, as the last overpowering appearing of Bayern failed.
Those who know Bayern are aware that we will nt put up with that and that we wll do everything to become sccssfl again, Kovac said.
Apart from this, he quietly bypassed his native city with his losers nd put his first defeat as Munich coach dwn to the ndqt handling of opportunities.
A wn over Amsterdam and Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday would make the first preliminary conclusion of hs term bng positive before the international break - thrws the tone will probably get worse.
So before the second premier class appearance in this season after the 2-0 over Bnfc Lisbon, Kovac ndrtk no extraordinary msrs.
As it was planned, after th day off on Sunday strtd quick preparation for the second prlmnry round mtch against Ajax, who beat AEK Athens confidently 3-0 as well.
Now thy ’ ve scored a victory over us in tw games, but we will ls reach our goals again, announced captain of th national team Manuel Neuer.
Already after the lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt, at th same position the most notably in pln text spoke Jsh Kimmich.
Th right defender take on the role of admonisher.
I do nt blv that ths is all bad luck, we need to work it t again, because we do not go for most of the opportunities and make mistakes, said the 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic stdm.
On the seventh match dy of th previous season Bayern was even five points behind Dortmund, which has nw taken over with one point ahead.
nd so Kimmich appreciated only with a shrug of its shoulders at least positively, that now the public debate about supposedly invincible Bvr has ndd.
Yes, that ’ s good, sd the national plyr.
It is a good thng for the league.
DFB boss comes under fire: Özl-Cs: Sharp ttck of Erdogan on Grindel
The Turkish president Erdogan condemns the xclsn of Mesut Özl and Ilkay Gündogan in Germany amidst serious accusations.
The DFB president Grindel admits mistakes but phlds the ssctn ’ s line.
Now will be crtd a new post.
Berlin - Recep Tayyip rdgn and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages fr interpretation in the lengthy Mesut Özl dispute.
After the Turkish President criticized th speech of the former world champion in Germany at the opening of large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, the hd of DFB phld the association ’ s ln.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindl, wh had been prsnlly attacked by Özil, reported on the consequences of the ss on the Mainz ZDF “ Sprt studio ”.
As we have a lot of players wth a migration bckgrnd in the U teams, in future we must draw very specific conclusions, so something like this this ds not happen again, said the 57-year-old and plans to get a national player wtht a migration bckgrnd as an additional integration ffcl.
Grndl also explained gn that Erdogan does not stand for the values of football and the DFB.
Th latter was very critical of the racism gnst Özil and Ilkay Gündogan.
r Mesut Özil, brn and raised in Germany, and our Ilkay.
They excluded them from this association because they allowed me to be photographed with them in nglnd," sd Erdogan in Domstadt on Strdy.
Frnkly speaking, as their president, I could not accept the fact tht our two young men, wh had been risen to the German national tm, were excluded.
Grindel pointed at Gündogan's statement that in contrast to Özl, after the World Cup affair, which had bn taken photos of the two with Erdogan, he felt tht he was "reasonably trtd by th DFB".
He also sd he wanted to stnd up for players in future.
Tht thing they say: If I wn - I ’ m German, if I lose - I ’ m a migrant - that will not wrk.
I am very srry that he had sch an impression, said Grindel.
I ’ ve always sd that we had to dfnd Mesut more.
Yet he ds not see grounds for Özil to return to th national team.
As a consequence, in addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Ssc of Cameroon ancestry, nw should be ppntd an additional integration representative.
If somebody without a mgrtn background is an obvious nflncr in society and football and sys: The issue is an important n, we need to do something about it ’, this wld also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration needs to wrk ’, Grindel said.
Despite th criticism of his person after the World Cup and the Özl affair, he wants to rn for the post of DFB President again next year.
I do my work nd take cr I do it as well as possible, Grindel said.

On Mndy farmers are llwd to start the annual hedge bank maintainance
On Mndy Schlswg-Hlstn farmers can start with the annual hedge bank maintainance.
Fr around 200 years, the "green rmprts" which are nq in Germany, have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor state.
The tree and undergrowth hedges, up to five meters wide, are ‘ forest replacements ’ and fr many animals nd plnts are the last areas of retreat.
Hedge banks connect as corridors scttrd habitats, through which the exchange of organisms can still function, as the executive director of th Nature And Bdvrsty Conservation Union (NABU) in Schlswg-Hlstn, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Hedge bnks are living fences
In the yr 1766 the hedge banks were created at the command of the Danish King Christian VI who rld over Schlswg-Hlstn.
The ‘ living fences ’ were not just fld boundaries and cattle fencing, they also prvdd farmers with firewood and bms for their half-timbered houses.
From that tm comes the name "Knick": By "bndng over" (Umknicken) the branches, the dns, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, around 45 000 kilometers of hedgerows stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, giving the image of a wdd, dvrsly strctrd landscape.
According to the NB ’ s details thy are used by approximately 7,000 animal species as an alternative habitat.
n kilometre of hedge bnk may contain up to 1 800 different species and up to 30 prs of birds may breed there.
The hdg banks can only fulfill their clgclly important role if they are maintained accordingly in the winter.
Otherwise, it is stntd to a sparse tree line, which causes not only losses in bdvrsty but ls in the windbreaking effect, said Ludwichowski.
Th hedge bnk maintenance, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, can only take place outside the breeding period or from ctbr until March.

Were you on location when the tsunami tk place?
No, I was in Jakarta on Jv slnd at the time.
At the time of the rthqks, my wife called me, she ws in Palu.
When I heard bt the tsunami, I mmdtly returned to Sulawesi.
I rrvd there on Sunday morning, because I still had to drive fr more than 20 hours by car after the flght as th airport at Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on th island now?
The ntnl government has opened th airport again, so aid supply can be flown in.
When I arrived, I saw the houses on the cst, which wr completely destroyed.
Our ‘ World Vision ’ office is also destroyed, but we have st something up provisionally, where other people hv also been ccmmdtd.
Where are th people of Sulawesi living now?
Many ran to the surrounding hills, where they held out through fear of another tsunami nd earthquake, nd where thr is no access to water and food.
Mny stopped in front of thr houses with aftershocks still being experienced.
As many food shps and gas sttns are completely shut, some people are stealing provisions and gasoline.
The public srvcs have completely shut down and th national government is helping.
Even a prison was destroyed, the prisoners are running around free, and srchng fr them is difficult.
There are still lots of bodies lying around, many ppl have not been found and r missing.
How is the cmmnctn and information flw on the island?
At th moment we have mobile reception, which did not work prvsly and we have been receiving information v radio.
Many people are still lkng for their children, nghbrs and other persons, not knowing if they are alive and where they are staying, because people were not at hm drng th earthquake and were on the way to work, for example.
Th tsunami warning system did not work correctly.
Do you have any nfrmtn about this?
We do nt know the reasons fr this, but whn the all-clear was gvn, many people thought ‘ OK, no tsunami ’, and then it came.
In other regions not affected by the tsunami, there was false nfrmtn about a tsunami httng the region and they ran to the srrndng hills.
An island lk Sulawesi tht sits on the Pacific rim of fire, is not prepared for earthquakes?
Yet there r earthquakes every day, but this one was the wrst.
We normally know how to rct to an rthqk and are trained for evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake hs affected a lt of people.

Th last tn mnts felt like two hours to me, said Heidel: ‘ I can understand if the team was only half as nervous as I was on the bnch ’.
The boys wr afraid to squander the lead and thrfr kept retreating.
And threw everything they had into our dfns.
To hld on to the first thr points of the season.
We ll felt a huge weight lifted off r shoulders, sd Schöpf, whs scoring header played no insignificant part: "And I am actually the worst header on the team."
But in th end, victory is ll that counts.
The relief was felt throughout the entire rn, not lst by Tedesco.
We wanted to start strng in the early stgs and make a firework of it, said Schalke ’ s hd coach.
The win was an mprtnt one.
Finally we cn enjoy ourselves for a few hours.
I am very, very happy for the team nd the fns.
We played smrt, calmly and with courage, that is how we must pprch matches over 90 minutes
The biggest shortcoming of the afternoon: The "Ryl Blues" missed their chance to stblsh control over the mtch early.
After all, thy did get thr chances, fr example via the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, wh hit the crossbar twice (59th/72nd) or Amine Harit (62nd).
Tht way it would not have been such a nerve wrecking victory, said Tdsc: "You really could feel the fr a little bit."
So I am gld that we won.
He was not th only one at Schalke.

Prf. Dr. ldn El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at eye level
Professor Doctor Aladin l-Mfln is standing before them.
He has once again ccptd the invitation from Ernst Reiling and Lr Hauschild.
Fr many year, I have made it my mission to bring ntrstng people to Greven, explains the fndr and chrmn of the "Reckenfelder Trff" - the association that cooperates in organizing the evening with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance.
El-Mafaalani casually starts the reading, describing the writing process of the bk, talking about how difficult it was to xpln th topic comprehensibly.
With a lot of gestures, tangible nmbrs and a joke or two, he introduces th audience to one of the most contentious topics: Migration and ntgrtn.
Why are there increasingly conflicts, dspt successful integration?
Th Syrian-born author uses a metaphor to answer the qstn.
Th German society sts at the big table, the migrants of the first gnrtn at the kid ’ s table.
Their children grow up in Germany and wnt to sit at th table.
The third generation of migrants is born in Germany . They always sat at the bg tbl and now wnt to have a say too.
This lds to conflicts.
Thrfr, it is not of importance whether one is pltclly right or lft, but: "Am I for or against an pn society?" he emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, thn th discussion round gets more and more lively.
And thr is a need for discussion.
An Afghan refugee rprts from his perspective, and two tchrs explain how they s successful or unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stnds in front of the stage, not on it, symbolizing th discussion: It is a discussion at eye lvl.
The sclgy professor does not force his pnn onto th audience, emphasizing that he speaks of the average, not of individual destinies.
He is hppy that people are interested in the topic, because “ we can only fnd a solution nc we understand what th problem is, ” says El-Mafaalani.
Even during th sbsqnt signing session, he still has an open ear for the guests ’ questions and the discussion continued in th foyer over Kurdish specialties.

This way, Schlk player Naldo is ls a great athlete on the bench
Not in th starting lineup for the third time in a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke coach Dmnc Tdsc.
Gelsenkirchen - ftr Rnld Aparecido Rodrigues has not been in the Schlk starting line-up for the third time in a row, many people would have understood it if th almost two-meters-tall Brazilian player had got his frstrtn off his chest.
But when the Schalke players gathered after the 1-0 win over FSV Mnz 05 in the center circle as usual and hd coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his players, th 36-year-old ncknmd Naldo stepped in and said; "We have to thnk, coach!"
Tht was very emotional, he is such a great sport, Tedesco sd later bt the reaction of his vice-captain, who holds no grudge despite his st on the bench.
Naldo, who was awarded best Schalke plyr last season, probably knws that he is actually not going to be stuck on th bench - he ds have a good reason for this break.
A reason called “ load cntrl . ”
It was nt easy to tell him
It ws nt easy to tell him that, I tell you, Tdsc said when he told Naldo that he was not in the starting lineup.
He is an mprtnt player . He is an mprtnt person.
But it ’ s always bt the thng, it ’ s about the club, ” said Tdsc as he justifies the step.
Naldo plyd 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 yrs old.
It is mprtnt that everyone can catch thr breath at the moment.
And tht we keep everyone together, said Tdsc explaining the rotation, which has recently hit Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted wisely: by proving hmslf as a model team plyr on the bench.
Cmprd to the rest of the euro zn, the descending md in Austria's industry continued to accelerate further in August.
The purchasing mngrs index (PMI) ws at a 37-month low at 46.7 points.
Across Europe, however, Austria still has the thrd-bst mood in Europe after Ireland and th Netherlands, sttd th Markit Institute on Monday about its survey of 3,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the r zn PMI rose by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, putting the ndx below the growth indicating 50-counter mrk for the 13th month in a row.
nly Ireland's industry cracked this threshold in August wth 50.9 points.

In Grmny, France nd Spain, the mood barometer did fall, but it fell more slowly than in th previous months.
In Spain, th index rchd 44.0 points, its highest level since March.
However, the slightly sd downswing could mean that the worst is vr, said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the industry - at least in the third quarter - remains th number one grwth brake.
A quick rtrn to the grwth zone is not in sight: Export orders to the eurozone have not fallen this mch since November 2011.
That is why companies hv cut back jobs fr the seventh month in a row.

Th mood barometer fell from 49.3 points in the prvs month to 47.6 points.
Experts hd initially expected 47.8 points.
Th PMI figures are based on representative surveys of 3,000 European ndstrl companies.
