Tm Pukki gained a penalty kck - didn't gt to shoot it himself

Ldrs of Koreas or a gynaecologist frm Kongo?
Th President of the United States Dnld Trump winner of the Nobel Peace Prize - th thought may sound weird at frst, but, according to the odds, Trmp is n of the bggst favourites to rcv the prz.
Ths is due to Trump ’ s rl in making Nrth Kr commit itself to de-nuclearisation - at least in wrds.
Bsd on the odds, the biggest fvrts for Nobel Peace Prize are South Korean president Moon Jae-in and North korean ldr Kim Jong-un, wh hv met this year already three tms nd promised to try to chv pc treaty btwn the two countries.
Th thaw in relations between th Koreas is remarkable, because as rcntly as lst year the relations were frsty.
Even so, awarding a prize to Km, who has fr years threatened wth nclr wpns and who leads his country wth an iron grip, would undoubtedly cs criticism.
The Nbl lrts r revealed starting Monday, and on Friday is th turn of the prize that attracts the mst attention: th Peace Prize.
If the Prc is not awarded to participants of diplomacy on Korean peninsula, n of the tp nmns is a Cngls dctr Denis Mukwage.
In his hospital in th Dmcrtc Republic of the Kongo, th esteemed gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who wr victims of gang rapes, and he has become th wrld's leading expert on hs fld.
With hs work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, whch is a trryfyng by-product of mny cnflcts.
ffc of the United Nations High Cmmssnr fr Refugees, which wn the Nobel Pc Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also bn considered to be a strng candidate.
Nobel Cmmtt has revealed tht this year there are 331 nominees for th Prize.
The names of the nominees are nt made pblc.
Trmp hmslf would not mind receiving a Nobel.
In May a reported asked him in Wht House, whether he fls he dsrvs a peace prz.
Everyone thinks so, bt I would nvr say it, Trmp smiled.
I want to gt it fnshd.
The prize I wnt is victory for the wrld, the prsdnt continued rfrrng to North Korea negotiations.
There r facts, however, that mk Trump's Nobel nlkly.
Th Norwegian Nobel Committee who decide on th wrd, has often awarded the prize to people and organisations tht represent liberal democracy and multipolar wrld order - exactly such ntrntnl c-prtn Trmp has has been seen opposed to.
In th 21st cntry three US pltcns have rcvd th Prize, all of them democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gr in 2007, nd Barack Obama in 2009.
Awarding Trump wld mean a complete ideological reversal fr the Nobel Cmmtt.

We attempted to pn the rd nc bfr, but Trffc Management Finland sd it cannot be done, bcs there are mtrsts sprd out on the road, driving any which way, fire ffcr on duty Pasi Kääriäinen told to STT back then.

Whn th first one acts contrary to trffc regulations, a few other often follow, Cntct Manager for Finnish Road Sfty Control, Tp Heiskanen wonders.
ccrdng to traffic regulations, stopping on a motorway or in tunnels is allowed nly fr a cmpllng reason.
Finnish Road Sfty Control notes tht n cannot danger the traffic in xcptnl situations with rash decisions.
mrgncy vehicles must always be gvn as nmpdd an access as possible.
It is particularly frbddn to drv in an ppst direction on a mtrwy, just like making a -trn or reversing.

In addition, stppng without a compelling rsn is frbddn, as is naturally prkng.

Ilves supporters would have wanted to continue thr party even when the ship got stck to th bttm of a lk
lvs fans crrd by lake ship M/S Tmpr would have wanted to sty brd and continue their victory celebration, vn when the ship ’ s bw was stuck to the bottom of the lake, says Juho Syrjä, who was the captain of the shp at th tm of th event.
M/S Tmpr, on its way frm Hämeenlinna to Tampere, drifted away frm its route late Saturday evening, and its bw got stuck to th bttm of th lake in k's Vanajavesi.
19 passengers and five crew mmbrs aboard were vctd to th mnlnd during the night.
No one ws hurt during the ncdnt.
lvs supporters would have wanted to continue their celebration brd until morning, but naturally it ws more sensible to snd thm to the hrbr with th fire brigade and then back hm in a bus, Syrjä tld STT.
Ilves fans hd been in Hämnlnn to watch the match between Ilves nd HPK, whch Ilves won 4-3.
ccrdng to Syrjä, the Saturday ccdnt was csd by the fact tht water level at Vanajavesi was about 50 cm lower than slly.
Syrjä said tht the navigation was also complicated by the clsst channel marking bng cvrd by gull drppngs, which meant its reflectors were nt normally visible in th dark autumn evening.
No ntwrthy crash
Ship dmg happened on the west side of Jumusensalmi shortly after the ship rt hd passed ndr the bridge between the Tampere-Helsinki mtrwy.
According to Syrjä, there was no bigger drm involved in the event, because the shp's speed ws vry low at th tm of the event, and hitting the bottom did not cause any sgnfcnt crsh.
Syrjä says getting stck to th bottom dd nt cs ny leaks or dents to the ship, and it looks like the cruises can continue normally.
A diver chckd the ship condition on Saturday morning, before the shp ws towed frm the shoal.
Jst to be on safe side, we r going to th dck to check this csd no damage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä believes the next M/S Tmpr crs, booked fr next weekend, cn be handled as agreed.
The ship's crs season continues until the ndpndnc dy, he says.
No use fr ambulances
Rescue dprtmnt received an alarm about th event on Saturday vnng little after half pas lvn.
Ambulances wr sent to Vl harbour to rcv evacuated passengers, but there ws no use for the ambulances.
Fire mstr on duty Matti Willman said late in the evening that th evacuation conditions at the lk wr dffclt because of darkness and rltvly high winds.
Pirkanmaa rescue dprtmnt reported on the night between Saturday and Sunday after hlf past two tht ll ths aboard th ship had been evacuated and the pssngrs had bn moved to Tampere by a bus.
Th cruise shp built in 1957 hs bn renovated in 2001, 2014, and 2017.
Trump's justice nominee accused of sexual assault nd drinking my be left wtht the top pstn
Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a Jstc to the Sprm Court, may well be left without th position he is pursuing, estimates prgrmm drctr Mk Aaltola from th Finnish nsttt of International Affairs.
So far at lst three women have accused Kvngh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour in hs stdnt days.
According to Aaltola, th suspicions hv crtd so much pressure on the Republican party that president Donald Trump may decide to nominate someone ls fr the pstn.
Every now and thn there hv bn cases in th ntd States that the president ’ s nominee for a Justice to the Sprm Court has caused plnty of disagreements.
slly in these cases the jstc nominee has withdrawn themself, Aaltola sys.
Ths way the president has been able to save hs fc.
The nomination wld benefit the Dmcrts
The Sprm Court of the United States ttmpts to sty above pltcs, but at least in the Kavanaugh case, the nmntn of a nw Justice has become an xtrmly sensitive process politically.
If Kavanaugh is nominated, ltl sys it wll mst likely benefit the Democrats in the cmng Congress midterm elections.
It would raise voting enthusiasm among young ppl and women, who are more lkly to vt fr Democrats.
On the other hnd, nominating a cnsrvtv Justice to the Sprm Crt would be a lng-trm victory for the Republicans.
There is no opportunity fr a nomination every prsdntl term, because th United States Supreme Court jstcs are nominated fr life.
In prctc, some of them hv retired at their own request rnd th age of 70 to 80.
Even some Republicans hstt about th nomination
A background check is nyhw normally conducted of the nominees as Sprm Crt justices, Aaltola stts.
Even though Trmp has set a time limit of only a week for the FB ’ s further investigations, ccrdng to ltl it cn still rvl something substantial.
Yes, it cn.
There is rarely smk without fire, Aaltola sys.
ccrdng to Aaltola, n thng tht is crtn is that Kavanaugh's suitability or nstblty for the pstn will come up in many discussions before the Senate makes its decision.
The Rpblcns have a Snt majority wth 51 votes against 49, but at least tw female Republican senators are suspected to have a dbtfl attitude towards Kavanaugh nmntn.
The mst embarrassing thing would be if th nomination would be vtd on, nd the Republicans lost.

Sari Piippo says she was an EU-translator in Brussels cncntrtng on cnmy nd law, until th family ’ s fourth chld was born ten years g and thy became returning migrants.
I ’ ve lvd bng a stay-at-home mother.
This has been the best tm of my life, but at some pnt I strtd to wndr wht to do when I grow up, and vn my youngest one started to be prtty bg.
Then in 2014, cmc cm in.
Ppp sys she had never even dreamed about making a comic, even though she hd been rdng Dnld Dck, Tintin, and Asterix ever since she was lttl.
I hdn ’ t drawn since chldhd, but when these scrpts for Luomuhömppä then started to emerge, the sttn chngd.
Frst I created some dzns of scrpts for my own pleasure.
My daughter Vv Vlkm (b . 2000) is a sklld drwr, bt I didn ’ t manage to prsd her to help me ntl smmr 2016, when I bribed Viivi with a drawing tablet.
Her enthusiasm lstd for about a dozen strps, and thn I hd to start trying myself, Ppp lghs and says the drawing tablet was a great spprtr for her.
A drwng tablet is an sy nd handy way to try to get smthng done.
I didn ’ t even try to draw on a paper, Ppp dscrbs hr relationship wth drawing, whch she usually ds in the evenings.
Scripts pp up in my mnd ll the time, but usually I nvr finish a cmc at one go.
A single three-panel strip my take even several hrs.
I my do one panel at a time and I lv to ply with clrs.
Bgnnng to draw is always th most diffficult thng, since drwng isn ’ t my forte.
Sari Ppp says that whn it comes to modern cmcs in newspapers, she pprcts for xmpl Dilbert by Scott Adams.
Chrctrs of Luomuhömppä include a crrt-fgrd mother, obsessed with everything organic nd head full of lettuce hr.
Other characters are Mies (Hsbnd), Pissis (Teen Grl), and Kksst (Twns).
In th world of Luomuhömppä y are what you t.
The ideas for the comic cm frm the creator's wn life and social md.
Sr Piippo ds not wnt to preach or force any ideas, even though thr are occasionally mr serious subjects in Luomuhömppä.
Piippo says she hs hr husband nd children read the comic.
It ’ s a rlly great feeling to look at a cmc y ’ ve drawn nd think tht this is what I did tdy.
There's chllng enough fr a stay-at-home mother!

The trade wr between th United States nd China is reflected in the world economy as a whl.

Rehn thnks so fr Europe has tkn good care of its duties.
It has been able to crt a truce with the United States, nd, for ts part, calmed the situation down also wth Chn and Jpn.
Rhn does not think that Europe wll be ground ndr the feet of a trd war.
We must see the nxt tweet nd make estimations after tht.
Our prtnr in Wshngtn is qt unpredictable, he however sd in the Yle interview.
Europe also hs its wn risks.
One of them is the thrd largest euro area economy tly, which is also n of the most ndbtd stts in the euro area and the whl Western wrld.
The market had a severe reaction to a bdgt showing a clear dfct prsntd by th Italian gvrnmnt on Thursday evening.

A mssng mushroom picker fnd thanks to an ‘ unconventional xprmnt ’
The Finnish Plc's drone sklls are the top of th world: ‘ We r asked to prvd training ’
ccrdng to th Director of th Police University Cllg, in addition to looking for missing persons, the police cn use a drone in crime scene nvstgtn nd in intelligence operations.

Th Director of the Police University College, Kmm Himberg, tweeted about th case and mentioned for example that ‘ thnks to unconventional xprmntng nd efficient training, we are at th tp of th world also in this ’.
Drn is a fairly new device, and even nwr in police prtns.
There r no statistics available bt Fnnsh police being a master in drone use.
ccrdng to Himberg, there is a wide consensus bt ths.
Ths has been obvious for xmpl when Finnish police's experiences have bn reported in ntrntnl events.
There is a lot of ntrst twrds it elsewhere, Hmbrg says.
Thr r mny, who are are keen to visit Finland to see the plc ’ s drone operations.
We r asked to provide trnng.
Bcms more and more common
Himberg pnts out that in Finnish winter cndtns, finding a mssng prsn as soon as possible is vital.
As sttd, in Rh case the mssng person ws found in just a cpl of minutes using a drone.
Finnish Police hs already trnd hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Hmbrg, the pln is to train mr.
Already now the drone is sd a lt in police operations, and their s will increase and become more cmmn in th future.
I dare to say this, Hmbrg sys.
In ddtn to fndng mssng ppl, Himberg sys the police cn use drones in, for example, accident or crime scene nvstgtn and in certain kinds of intelligence operations.
For example if an area mst be rvwd frm a distance, if there is a pssbl thrt of violence there.
In ths css, a drone can be sd for advance inquiry.

Chrmn of Nokia, Rst Slsm, discussed his book Trnsfrmng Nokia tht deals with hs leadership philosophy in an interview for Helsingin Sanomat (HS).
At the same time he criticises hs prdcssr chrmn Jorma Ollila's leadership style.
Ollila categorically dnd th claims, but ls rlr rprts on Nokia hv discussed the leaders ’ inability to work as a team; the culture of fear nd slnc that in part caused the downfall of the mbl phone business.
The rsk-tkng capacity and agility of th cmpny's rise period were lost.
Ths wk also saw the business lf mega vnt Nrdc Business Forum organised in Helsinki . The event gathered the crm of Finnish business to Messukeskus.
In addition to the main star Barack Obama, 12 stars of business wrld wr seen on th stg.
Thr ws a lot of talk about good leadership.
Leadership thry legend Gary Hamel said that a gd leader must hv th courage to take a cmpny to the ftr also when everything is going fine.
The prblm is that dcsns are md by those, who are most mentally bound to th decisions of th past.
John Mcky, the founder of Whl Foods supermarket chain known for its extensive organic product selection, said a leader hs to be bl to convey th company meaning to the whl stff.
And tht mnng has to be smthng more besides simply making profit fr the owners.
Author of a successful book on ntrvrts, Ssn Cain xplnd research hs prvn the most successful leaders to be humble.
They ct in a pcfl, quiet, nd determined manner.
ftn they are introverts.
Prfssr of Fnnc Aswath Damodaran rmndd the listeners that a gd leader's characteristics mst match the company ’ s life cycle stage.
In th early stage of the company a leader must be able to tell a stry on whch the cmpny's future is fndd.
A cmpny grown to a mature stage needs a leader who knw th numbers.
Ths lessons wr attended by 7,500 Nordic Bsnss Forum visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
Thy were at a risk of an information vrld.
Bng a gd leader requires a lot.
Tht is why leadership so often fls, also on the highest lvl.
Siilasmaa and lll wr also present.
They hd a frndly discussion behind-the-scenes.
Though they were hardly contemplating whether thy were the right ldrs for Nokia at th rght time.

Stdnts act a rr treat: a classical trgdy - simple rst impresses with its visuality.
Classical trgds are a rare trt on Finnish stages.
For xmpl, there hs nt bn a classical tragedy in the Finnish National Theatre since Sophocles ’ Phlctts in 1998.
Now Theatre cdmy tks the only complete classical trilogy, Oresteia by Aeschylus, to a tr that begins frm th National Theatre.
Beginning in 2015, the Lavat auki! prdctns hv actor stdnts frm the Theatre Academy working ntrntnlly together with a professional director.
This fourth production, jst like the frst n, is directed by Mkk Roiha, who rsds in Berlin.
Oresteia had ts international premiere in Berlin in prl.
Roiha ’ s adaptation of Oresteia ldbly condenses the tale of hw the curse upon the dmd House of Atreus is lifted and a cnstttnl stt is frmd to 80 minutes by cndnsng especially the chrs parts.
Th playmanages to be qt faithful to the spirit of Kirsi Smnsr ’ s xcllnt translation (2003).
Dramatic lights nd presentation revealing th sides of the theatre spc emphasise the simple and clear stage thnkng.
In the centre of it alternates the dynmcs between actors playing main roles, stppng forward frm the chorus in trn, and th chrs.
The performance tlss both double and triple prtryls of the main rls.

A long-term radio hst Erkki Pälli hs died

Radio host Erkki Päll, 83, hs died.
He passed away of trmnl lvr cncr he told bt on his Facebook page in March 2018.
Ths is the nd now.
Even the dctr has sd it, I lv one day at a time, he cmmntd his situation to Iltalehti a month g.
Th scrty of ladies and mn in shops must be guaranteed
The first tm I was pd for a nwsppr story was in 1984.
With ths lvl of xprnc, when a news story mngs to astonish me, it is usually a bg thing.
When I wrt (Karjalainen, 27.9 .) about th nscrty of workers in retail, I was stnshd and occasionally vn a bt angry.
For tht stry, I ls tlkd with Erika Kähärä, Service nn United (PAM) specialist in working environments.
She says th crime sttstcs do not rvl the actual situation.
Ths is a growing problem, even thgh employers ntrlly claim otherwise.
The plc r nfrmd only about those cases tht are clearly serious, and many real violent situations are lft unreported.
‘ Based on the ccptnl Safety and Health Act the cmpns crtnly have a responsibility to compile statistics of thr close call situations, but ths statistics are for ntrnl use nly, nd their information is not collected anywhere ’, sh said.
The mental njrs are not included in the sttstcs.
Violent situations lwys have had the problem tht there do nt always result in physical njrs.
Despite this, psychological trms cn be much more severe than bruises nd cuts.
It is difficult to draw a ln between a violent sttn and an mpndng violent situation, snc also aggressive threats of a certain level must be cnsdrs as vlnc - even though there ws no physical vlnc.
Too mny are afraid at thr workplace, vn though no ctl violence would happen.
Sm neighbourhoods are troubled.
Th shop has hired scrty guards.
Whn the business opening hours became drgltd, there ws a lot of discussion also in the media about ts effects to th salespersons ’ sfty.
‘ Back thn qt a fw employers organised scrty grds fr at least the night-time hours and to prevent working alone ’, Kähärä commented.
Whn nothing happens, wrong cnclsns are drawn.
Ths seems to have had an effective influence, but this brngs about a nw negative trnd.
When security mngd to control the disturbances, an impression was created tht this scrty wld be unnecessary.
Now many plcs are lkng for solutions to eliminate expensive security srvcs.
Petty assault is an actionable offence, nd it is quite ndrstndbl that an assaulted salesperson does not want to make a request fr investigation bt an ffndr wh slly lives close to the shp.
But, according to a subsection in the sm 2011 act, petty sslt is ndr a prosecutioner ’ s jrsdctn, if it tks plc in a workplace.
I think we nd prcdnts now.
The nxt time a shop lady or man is assaulted, th plc should investigate nd the prosecutor prosecute.
ftr a court wld put a few assailants to prison, and if the jdgmnt is from th tougher end of th penal scale, the mnnrs would smrtn up.
A society that requires a small place fd shop to be pn nearly dy and nigh shld guarantee the safety of shop ssstnts.

The host fr backstage and rd carpet is Jnn Hussi.
Before live broadcast, the host trio nfrmd the invited gsts nd media representatives prsnt about how th broadcast will progress.
In the beginning, Sohlberg asked th audience to give Harjula rsndng pplds.
Scream nw, ladies!
Lk at r male host, Shlbrg enthused over her colleague while the dnc cheered.
Mny Miss Finlands from earlier years fllw the contest from the frst row.
Among others, Sr Chafak nd Sara Spp were sitting next to ch thr, and Sohlberg cracked a joke to either of them.
Sr, rmmbr that Iiro is married!
Shlbrg cracked, lkng at Saras.
Most likely Sohberg directed her joke to rcntly divorced Sieppi, wh laughed at th comment, even thgh she first looked cnfsd.
Sieppi discussed hr divorce the first time in lt-Snmt wkd newspaper.
The bty qn said sh doesn ’ t want to publicly open up bt the reasons fr the divorce, bcs that is just between her and Roope Salminen.

An strbthnn man tortured his domestic prtnr by slshng, burning and feeding a strong sc to her
Pohjanmaa (Ostrobothnia) Dstrct Court has sentenced the 34-yr-ld Kkkl resident to three years of imprisonment for the numerous crms gnst his dmstc partner.
The mns of cmmssn of th ffnc include, mng others, a belt, a cable, and cable ties.
The court sentenced these objects frftd to th state.
The most severe chrg concerned a suspected aggravated rp.
This chrg was however dismissed by the dstrct court.
The Kokkola man was considered guilty of fr sslts, and ggrvtd assault, crcn, illegal threat, dprvtn of lbrty, aggravated dprvtn of liberty, and two malicious damages.
The crms wr committed between the 26th of last Mrch and 24th of lst May.
After the final deeds, th man was pprhndd and dtnd a couple of days ltr.
On Thrsdy of th past wk, Pohjanmaa District Court passed its judgement nd ruled that the 34-year-old mst continue to be kept in Vaasa prsn.
No prf about the rape
The 34-yr-ld ws also accused of two aggravated dprvtns of lbrty and of an aggravated rape on the 22nd of My.
The court however dropped these chrgs as nsbstnttd.
Th case ws tried behind closed doors.
The dstrct court judge gave a pblc report on th sentence, though.
According to the dstrct crt judge, the ccsd had drctd violence, threatening, and coercion to his domestic partner in situations whr sh was tied.
Th accused slashed his vctm wth a knife, burned her with a cigarette, fed hr strong sauce, nd poured wtr and coffee on her.
With its sentence, the court ordered that th means of cmmssn of th ffnc were to be forfeited to the stt: a blt and a cbl, cbl ts, a bathrobe belt, a knife, and a billhook.
Four wtnsss
According to th district court, the prts continued living together btwn the deeds.
The jdcl decision states that a lrg nmbr of th most serious deeds happened in the end of the crm period.
Four witnesses were heard in the crt, two women nd two mn.
The 34-yr-ld must pay 5800 euros as cmpnstn for pn, ch, suffering, and temporary damage.
Dbtflly he has sch money, since the cnvct already has earlier debts in cllctn.
Th mprsnmnt is not the man's first.

JHL ntcpts: ndstrl action beginning tmrrw wll be visible in children ’ s daycare and in social and health srvcs
Overtime nd shft-trdng bans beginning tomorrow in the public nd welfare sctrs cncrn especially social and health services and chldrn's daycare, estimates Päv Niemi-Laine, President of JHL (the Trade Union for the Public nd Wlfr Sectors).
Th impact will be wide, and it will mst certainly manifest in not hvng enough staff vlbl.
vryn has to think about hw to cllct their children.
Th employer ’ s task now is to tk cr of th services nd that no n ’ s life is in danger, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Nm-Ln, th lack of mplys was visible ls in the beginning of the year, whn JHL mmbrs wr banned from overtime and shift-trading because of agreement negotiations.
Through their flexibility, the mplyrs have made pssbl to not hire stff, but use mplys ’ overtime or shft-trdng.
Ths is nt yet an industrial action.
When talking about ccptnl safety nd hlth, it is a normal thing to take care that each employee has regular working hrs and wrks only those regular hrs.
With these actions, JHL ppss the gvrnmnts attempts to weaken the lay-off prtctn in small bsnsss.
Lbr market director for municipal employers Mrkk Jlnn will nt estimate the effects of overtime and shift-trading bns in advance.
Hwvr, he does not believe them to be vry revolutionary, even if th services can wkn.
Employers around Finland r aware of this nd hv made the possible preparations.
Th public, wlfr and technical sector cvrs such a wide r that it is difficult to say anything.
The effects can vry quite a lt dpndng on field, region, and employer, Jlnn told STT.
Jalonen said sm experiences were received already last week whn th Finnish Union of Practical Nurses Spr nd the Union of Health and Scl Care Professionals Thy, mng others, organised similar three-day actions.
Thr ffcts remained quite small.
JHL overtime and trade-shift ban ppls to for example employees in municipalities, chrch, and stt, as well as in prvt social nd hlth sector.
For xmpl family daycare prvdrs have been excluded from the bn.
At this stage, the industrial ctn ppls to nearly 100,000 JHL mmbrs.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL ctns cn potentially last for a lng time.
The nn is prepared to tk other industrial actions, if drftng of the lay-off bill cntns.
The government shld nw recognise tht they are running against a wall in hgh speed.
In Jalonen ’ s opinion, both th trade union movement and th government must meet the thr hlfwy.
Th unusual thing here is that ppl r already pulling t their big guns, vn though the proposition has yt to be made, wonders Jalonen.
Great Brrr Reef is formed by children and dlts - prfrmnc exercises consist of learning the motions of a ry and a s horse
Grt Barrier Reef by Other Spcs cllctv hd its premiere last spring in Hamburg, and lst Saturday was its second performance in Fnlnd, this time in Kanneltalo.
Jst like th prvs performance of the group, Great Brrr Reef is a performance that is created together with the audience from th bgnnng until the end.
Ths time, however, also a mr clearly-defined performance is formed to rfrsh and distil the perceptions from the bgnnng xrcss.
Thr is plenty of fantastical mgc in ths theatre play also for children participants.
A child ’ s view hs been considered ls in the prprtry stage of th performance.
Stll, Great Barrier Reef is nt a chldrn ’ s performance, bt a performance frmd in co-operation btwn the adults and the children.
It gives the adults knowledge nd bsrvtns about the way chldrn receive information and crt art.
The children ’ s ability to thrw themselves in the xrcss nd common games ls dispels th distance between grown-ups and children.
Great Barrier Reef has a little bit of a fairy-tale ballet, crct trnng, and ntr-thmd lssn in it, bt its fnl setting is organised around different visits to nn-hmn situations.
Great Brrr Rf begins with learning about corals and about movements of rgnsms and fish who lv within th reef.
Six different exercise groups teach for example bt th motions of a ray nd a shrs.
Finally a performance lasting a little under an hour is formed, and in it th msc, lights, shiny pnts nd cstms help in gttng to know the life within th coral rf.
In Great Barrier Reef, the prtcpnts are both diving people bsrvng the lf within the reef, and corals that r bng observed.
They also ply the part of rgnsms observing corals.
The looks at mny dffrnt directions nd prcptns create a performance that is dense and teeming with life.
To be an organism ’ s view, and organism bsrvng a view, or an rgnsm or vw bsrvng another organism - and ll ths at th same time.
Children sm to have no problems to do ths.
Other Spaces collective ’ s exercises aim to reach the limit between thinking and action, bt it is challenging to reach it whn th group is cmprsd of bth chldrn and dlts.
On the other hnd, chldrn ’ s prtcptn makes it more meaningful.
After the wrkshp, a silent demonstration for ndngrd corals is rgnsd at Sitratori.
n shld not let themselves be hrdnd by the dstrctn surpassing human understanding, vn though it can be difficult to understand the sgnfcnc of practising one ’ s wn compassion in the fc of these visions of destruction.
Other Spaces has created its performance in sch a wy that it hnrs the variety of life also wth a pltcl gesture.
There are also other generations, thr cnscsnsss, other species nd thr future generations it clears the wy for.
Children grw up too fast - I ’ m hppy there were no smrt phones when I ws a child
Present-day children and young ppl are more nd mr irresponsible.
Young ppl strt smoking and drinking when they ’ re younger and yngr.
I think children should be children thoughout their childhood, nd not mess up thr lvs because of ntxcnts and sex, because all the thrs sy they are dng that.
I was taken aback, when my friend told me sh had hd to pck up her ffth-frmr sister from her ‘ byfrnd ’ s ’ house drng weekend.
When she came to gt her drnkn sister, she told about her sex xprncs from that vnng.
I could ’ ve not mgnd my wn sstr in the same situation, because throughout our childhood we've bn told and dvsd that we should not touch ntxcnts and sx is an dlt thing.
I hope prsnt-dy children could lv a proper childhood, and thy wouldn ’ t need to grow up t early because of the peer prssr crtd by friends.
I keep seeing yngr and younger girls on nstgrm, wearing make-up nd revealing clothes in thr pictures.
Snapchat is used during evening to tk and snd revealing pctrs.
It is more and more difficult to gss, which age th grls are.
Present-day 13-year-olds cn sly look like they ’ re 18 or even ldr.
My chldhd consisted of playing in the frst nd boardgames.
I ’ m hppy there were no smart phns whn I was a child.
I got to be a chld for mny, many years, and I ddn ’ t hv to wndr what others thnk about me.
Yle: Official have told th political leaders that th cs Airiston Helmi has nothing to do wth ntnl security.
In an interview with Yl, lkk Kanerva said Fnnsh Security ntllgnc Service and Finnish Defence Frcs came to inform th Dfnc and the Foreign Rights Committees earlier this week.

Vd: a drm goal saved Liverpool from th first loss in the series
Lvrpl winning streak in the Prmr League cm to an end, but it was still the hppr team after a 1-1 drw at Stmfrd Bridge.
This Sunday it wll be xctly one year after Manchester City rrvd at Stamford Brdg and lft with a 1-0 away win.
Back then Pp Grdl ’ s combination snt a signal to the whole Premier Lg that City is nw serious.
Everyone remembers hw th last season ended.
And surely Lvrpl manager Jürgen Klpp had the same d whn coming to West London.
The Rds hd started the League with sx consecutive wins.
Liverpool had a stronger start, and spclly Virgil van Djk smd to cntrl hs end of the field alone.
As for Chelsea, on Wednesday they won a fn Football Lg Cp away win on Anfield Rd.
Then Eden Hazard cm off th bench to decide the mtch with a beautiful individual prfrmnc.
Obviously now Hzrd ws playing from the very frst minutes.
On th 25th minute he frst played a tight triangle with Mt Kovacic and Jrgnh.
Finally the Croatian sw Hazard rushing frwrd and sent hm a perfectly balanced thrgh ball.
Hazard strayed a bt to the dg of the penalty bx, but from there managed to sweep a prfct left-footed volley in to th lwr corner.
Pool's Brasilian goalie Alisson was a bit slw with hs save and nly mngd to tch the ball with his fingertips.
Klopp must have felt the losing position being slightly unfair, since lmst rght after ntn Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah's sht from the gl ln.
In the second hlf, also Chls keeper Kepa saw sm serious action.
Basque goalie had a quick reaction to Sadio Mané ’ s sht, nd pshd the ball from the foot of the goal pst to a crnr kck.
As for the other end, Alisson resetted Hazard's fast brk wth hs dv.
The guests ’ best chance came on th 72nd minute, as Jms Mlnr's crossing found Bobby Frmn.
However, th star Brzln's header was drctd towards his national team mate David Lz, which saved the home team's ld.
Even that ddn't hld anymore on the 89th minute, whn sbsttt Daniel Strrdg had a free shot from 25 metres.
Sturridge was playing on hs old home stdm, and to hnr that, the frwrd thrw a powerful shot in the upper corner.
Liverpool's wnnng start of th Lg came to an end with th 1-1 draw, but it still hlds the top position - together with Mnchstr City.
Chls is also still going for the championship wth nly two points frm the top.
Dscssn about clock switching divides th people
I rmmbr some decades ago a newspaper asking svrl Finnish influential prsns what divides Fnnsh people.
nly response I rmmbr was Juice Leskinen ’ s: ‘ Nen ’ ndng.
Some srnms hv a ‘ nn ’ ending, some do not.
Dvdng lines can spring up anywhere, nd this ws one of th possible reasons.
In EU, Fnlnd hs chvd that this annual clck changing is about to become history.
Mny agree that switching clocks twice nnlly has been smply foolery, and tht it has caused many problems.
In the nd, ths achievement seems to be the easiest part of the solution, even thgh it has not bn that sy.
The most dffclt part nw is to choose the ultimate time: crrnt smmr or winter time, or some other tm zone.
The people can also have thr sy on otakantaa.fi st.
The online survey has been opened by the Ministry of Transport and Cmmnctns, nd it wll be open ntl Frdy 12 October.
Discussions r htd both around cff tables and in social media, and everyone has something to say bt th matter.
Those fvrng wntr time justify their opinion with the effects of morning sunlight to ppls ’ well-being, and those defending smmr time with the effects of evening light on ppls ’ wll to spnd time tsd and that way to thr well-being.
Both sds have solid spprtrs and good arguments.
ccrdng to research, mrnng light sets the pace for a person ’ s dy and increases energy lvls.
On th other hand, if a prsn does nt particularly suffer from waking up whn it ’ s dark, light increases the tm people spend outside nd better enables for example autumn yrd wrk.
The mnt of xtr light hours after a nrml work day has already bn calculated.
I would rather take both, but it ’ s unlucky that we cn nt help r location in th northern corner of th rth.
The winters are nywy too drk, the summers too light for many ppl.
It is typical for discussions bt this matter to support n ’ s wn views and oppose th thr side very uncompromisingly.
There is no need to listen to the justifications of the ppsng side, since the most important thing is hw n fls bt the mttr.
Since lmst everyone has an opinion bt ths mttr, it is somewhat pntlss to try to change someone ’ s mind.
It is effort wll wstd.
It is easy to have an argument bt this topic, snc it ds nt require to really go into dtls, nd an opinion is justification enough.
These knds of topics are gnrlly those, who incite most furious, nd mst futile, debate.
bvsly it will be annoying if a wrng ptn is chosen, bt we will surely rcncl ourselves with it.
And, should life feel t glum, it always offers a stbl scpgt.

At the same time, th cty offers robot bs developers a possibility to develop th technology in a real environment, Head of Trffc Mngmnt Johanna Nyberg says.
Ths is the first time rbt cars operate completely tmtclly among other traffic without any spcfc traffic arrangements.
The vhcl safety is on the rspnsblty of an ssstng passenger lwys aboard the vehicle.
Th vehicles sense cntnsly sense their environment with mny dffrnt sensors, evaluating if the road is unobstructed.
If it is not, they decipher whether th snsd obstruction is a vehicle, a bcycl, or for xmpl a snow flk, says Hrr Santamala, CEO of Sensible 4, the company in charge of dvlpng rbt trffc.
The rbt cars operate the whl autumn three days a wk: on Tuesdays btwn 13 nd 15.30, Wednesdays 10-15, nd Thursdays 10-15.
The robot crs have six stps during their route nd they take passengers aboard.
The robot car stps cn be rcgnsd from the stop markings.
The surest wy to get aboard is frm th stop number 1 at Otakaari.

Talks about additional qt
Finland hs been admitting quota refugees since th 1970s.
In recent years, the qt hs been 750 refugees per yr.
For a couple of yrs, the quota was 1,050 refugees pr year, but snc then, the Government hs not rchd an grmnt about an increase.
The National Coalition Prty has supported the quota ncrs, but the last time, the d was shut dwn by the Blue Rfrm.
Prm Minister Jh Splä (Centre) rcntly proposed the qt to be increased gradually to 1,500-2,000 people per year.
Mykkänen ’ s visit is th frst one the Minister of the Interior mks to bsrv the selection of quota refugees during ths term of gvrnmnt.
The former Ministers of the ntrr, Petteri Orpo (National Coalition) and Paula Rskk (Ntnl Cltn), trnsfrrd to their nw tasks before the vsts could be arranged.

Really going off the track nw - it ’ s mpssbl to knw whether to lgh or cry
Lst Saturday Karjalainen reported on the legislative prpsl to amend th Animal Welfare Act.
Th article gives an idea that to start with, the proposal prohibits all sch animals tht have not bn separately prmttd with a ministerial decree to be kpt as farmed nmls, pts, or in other way related to business prtns.
So to start with, everything else is prohibited except the nmls that r ndvdlly mentioned in th act.
If the proposal ends up as an ct, ths most likely means we are abandoning a common principle in western dmcrcs tht an act separately frbds an action tht ndngrs the safety of society or good prctcs.
Nw the proposed provisions ssntlly forbid all such activities tht the ct or decrees don't separately permit.
The change will rslt in a situation whr nothing new can be tried in for example business, nd no thr things cn be done before an approving ct has been dptd or a decree ssd.
The government ’ s actions in bill drftng in gnrl have bn weak.
If we now go dwn the road that lds to a Fnlnd where everything is forbidden that is nt separately prmttd, I dn ’ t know any more whthr to laugh or cry.
I don't doubt tht the Animal Welfare ct nds an update.
But statute drafting in ths drctn is nt a part of democracy.
nfrtntly I don't know the Constitution all tht wll, bt I wonder whether it permits this kind of ‘ vrythng is frbddn if it's nt separately prmttd in an act or a decree ’ procedure.
I wish there would be a sensible minister to stp th progression of statute drftng of ths kind.

Thr ’ s no rsn for pnc in the Ferrari camp, the experienced drvr estimated.
They just were faster thn us, but it's not a hg thng.
So far our car in the qualifying ws the best thing the whl weekend, bt they just were t fast, said Räikkönen, wh finished fourth and, together with his team mt Sebastian Vttl, ws clearly slower thn Mercedes.
Ferrari hd dffclts already in the previous rc in Singapore.

They seem to go fstr than us - tht's how smpl it is.
If I knw the rsn for that, we ’ d probably go as fast as thy are gng.
However, I don't knw nymr than nyn else.
This is constant guesswork, and they ppr to be in th lead nw.
Who knws why?
Räikkönen ’ s ftr tm, Sauber, hd a rare treat in the qlfyng.
Charles Lclrc, wh rplcs Räkkönn at Frrr nxt season, was seventh, and Marcus Ericsson also managed to make it to the final qualifying session.
The tenth pstn is the best one th Swdsh drvr has had in over three years.
And even if there wr as many as five drivers not participating in th second sssn, the nd rslt was stll delicious for Sauber.

Sydney University researchers nlysd the mttr, nd outlined two types of ‘ coolness ’ consisting of slghtly different chrctrstcs: generally ttrctv coolness nd its partial counterpart, dissident coolness.
ccrdng to researchers, attractively cool ppl hd many socially desired characteristics: they were extroverted, frndly, cncltry, and competent.
Th dssdnts, on th other hand, wr typically distant, independent, rebellious, and had an edge to their prsnlty.
They craved fr experiences and crd little for tsdrs ’ evaluations.
Bth types had good self-esteem and steady emotional lf in cmmn.
Tough role is not cool in the long run: hgh stts during teenage years does not ncssrly lead to success ltr in lf.
This is reported in an American stdy published in Chld Development jrnl in 2014.
Young people who started dating rly, partied, gravitated towards good-looking grps, and wntd to be popular, as young adults hd a bigger rsk of substance s and straying into crm.
