Kschv: At the 73rd session of the UN Gnrl ssmbly th subject of Russia in a negative light was practically bsnt
The head of the Federation Council cmmtt on foreign affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers tht th 73rd sssn of the UN General Assembly ws successful for Russia nd does nt exclude that it could become a trnng point in th prcptn of the Russian Fdrtn as an integral participant in the solution of global wrld problems.
"The uniqueness of th current 73rd session, in my opinion, is in that the rhetoric, to whch we had lrdy lmst bcm ccstmd in recent yrs in rltn to Russia, was now much more subdued," sd th senator in an interview pblshd on Sunday by Rossiiskaya Gazeta.
He xplnd tht in previous years the Rssn Federation ws sometimes "referred to as one of the thr main thrts to humanity, on par with Ebola fvr or clmt change or terrorism, Russia was among these, in any case, in th narrative of a grp of western countries, whch on this account spoke out qt nnmsly".
At the 73rd sssn, mphssd Kschv, "th subject of Russia in a negative light was prctclly absent".
"If n carefully analyses th speech of th prsdnt of USA, the president of Frnc, the spch of the frgn minister of Grmny, I'm not now tkng Ukraine, Grg, or the British, in ny case, there was certainly no choir," the pltcn pointed out, ntng that Rss "is no lngr a kind of wall on which to practise httng a tennis ball".
The head of the Federation Cncl cmmtt does not exclude tht this indicates a kind of tendency which, in hs opinion, "will distinguish the current sssn [of the UN Gnrl Assembly], lthgh ths tndncy my only fully manifest itself in a yr, in two, three".
"I do not exclude that the current session in some sns my be pivotal," llwd Kosachev, explaining tht "thr are too mny xmpls of how with the nclsn of Russia it is possible to move frwrd in international ffrs".
As an example he gv th situation in Syria, around Iran nd Nrth Korea.
"At the mmnt, nfrtntly, it is not Ukraine, bt I do nt doubt tht in time the Rssn view on the krnn crss will also be sought," the parliamentarian added.
He sppss that ths is connected wth the appearance of a "sensible, reasonable perception of Russia as not jst a possible but ntgrl prtcpnt in th solution of global problems of r time."
"I hp I am not mistaken, but I hv a flng that we will pass the pnt somewhere beyond which movement will nt be backwards, it will be mvmnt frwrds," he ddd.
n other "interesting and important flng" in ths context Kosachev said was the "demand fr the Russian view of hw the mdrn world should develop".
"I was prsnt at a great many meetings of th hd of the Russian delegation [at the Gnrl Assembly sssn] foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my wn mtngs, and wth great pleasure I saw that while one-two years or fv years ago on the whole nbdy was ntrstd in the Russian pnn, the Rssn vw of what is happening in the world, nw th sttn is different," said th chair of the Federation Council committee.
In hs opinion, this is d to how "th s-clld nw liberal order, represented by the West, does not have answers to the questions of how to solve ntrntnl problems due to the obvious lack of ideas in th global spc, the lack of ds on how to slv th problems of the Mddl East, prblms of terrorism, problems of nnprlfrtn of nclr weapons, problems of mgrtn".
"And now the demand for the Rssn view is bcmng more nd mr bvs," Kosachev said with certainty, stressing that in this sense he considers "the current session sccssfl fr the work of the Rssn dlgtn, sccssfl for Russia".

Th Evolution of th “ Alternative ”
The Alternative for Grmny party ws founded in Sptmbr 2012 t of the “ Electoral ltrntv 2013 ” grp, which had taken in frmr members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group ntlly arose in opposition to gvrnmnt policy, but early on it handled only economic sss, ncldng prblms with the euro and interactions wthn the EU.
The group spk out against Grmny “ subsidizing ” weak EU cnms, and didn ’ t xcld the pssblty of reimbursing Germany and of a full exit from th European nn.
As th mmgrtn crisis dpnd, the AfD ’ s platform expanded.
In 2013 the group bcm a full-fledged political party, which occupied th rscptc niche and began to hrshly criticize the government for the failure of ts mmgrtn policy.
In the lst parliamentary lctns in 2017, the fD managed to enter th Bundestag for the frst time, getting 94 sts (out of 709).

In the match btwn Lokomotiv nd khmt, Turbin's rrrs rained down fast and furious
Former all-union rfr Vldmr Levitin commented on the performance of referee Evgeny Trbn in the mtch of th 9th rnd of th Russian championship between Lokomotiv and Akhmat and ssssd the controversial incidents of the game.
"Hw would you ssss Evgeny Turbin's rfrng in the match between Lokomotiv and khmt?"
"I blv tht the referee confirmed that he is not stbl for refereeing matches in the Rssn Prmr League.
It surprises me tht wth the mess in th fifth round gm between Spartak and Dinamo, neither Turbin hmslf, nr the heads of Dinamo drew any srs conclusions about his lck of abilities.
Th result hd a quick impact on the nnth round: errors in his performance and missed calls on bd tckls rained down fast nd furious.
For xmpl, in the 50th minute, Locomotiv's Eder pshd over khmt dfndr Rdlf in his own penalty area.
Just eight mtrs frm the goal line, but Turbin dd not call a pnlty".
"How wld you assess the ncdnt with th participation of Idowu, wh in the 82nd minute appeared to handle th ball?"
"I believe the dfndr deliberately handled th ball in his wn penalty area.
Turbin was close to th incident, had a gd vw of it, nd his ssstnt was to the right.
This ncdnt should have been sn by th fourth official Sergey Karasev.
However, none of the three rfrs dd not s it, and no penalty ws awarded.
Therefore, th score was crrptd, nd any sporting justice was ripped up.
It ws a case in which refereeing by th rls ws ousted nd the sporting spirit of the game buried".
"In the 52nd mnt, Turbin did not dr to send off dfndr Oleg Ivanov, who cmmtd a foul in a dl with Krychowiak, and whn the referee showed him a yellow card, he dfntly ppldd hm.
Wht do y think of this incident?
Was it ncssry to brndsh the second yellow crd?"
"In this ncdnt Turbin brandished th first yellow card in somewhat spurious crcmstncs.
A second wld hv been logic".
"lg Ivanov tlkd ftr th match about refereeing double standards in that some tms are awarded a penalty for such violations, as in th incident with dw, and others are not.
How would y assess th player's words?"
"It depends on how you interpret dbl stndrds.
It was a pnlty.
But it wsn't gvn.
So th referee did not gv a second penalty in the ppstn goal.
That was the principle ppld hr.
nd the scnd incident with double standards is tht the referee lks at who is playing.
On Saturday Lcmtv and Akhmat plyd, and thr have bn serious complaints bt Turbin's performance, bcs the team was put at a disadvantage".

The comedy Nght Schl, whch debuted last Friday at American movie theaters, earned $28 million on ts frst weekend in distribution.
This sccss allowed th unimaginative flick starring Kevin Hrt and Tiffany Haddish to top the US box office fr 28-30 Sptmbr.
Rlsd so fr in only 20 countries, the film brought in $5.5 million, including $2 mlln frm British vwrs.
In ts fght for first place, wht ’ s rmrkbl is that ths creation of Mlclm Lee pretty clearly got ahead of another nwcmr in western distribution, th cartoon Smallfoot, a crs story of a charming yeti meeting a representative of humankind, whs existence the starring chrctr hd never believed in.
This prjct of directors Karey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig collected $23 million on ts kckff weekend, basically justifying the xpcttns of experts wh had predicted $20-25 mlln fr the weekend.
Regarding Smllft ’ s total box-office rcpts, at th mmnt they mnt to $38.6 mlln (while it has debuted already in 50 countries): ts most active mrkt was Mexico, filling the coffers wth $3.6 million.
Th top three at the time ws completed with the children ’ s tale “ The House wth a Clock in Its Wlls, ” frm horror master l Roth . This proves conclusively tht the director can produce qlty movies fr the 12+ dnc too.
For ts second week in dstrbtn, the screen dpttn of Jhn Bllrs ’ bk wth th charming Jack Black and Cate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing total global receipts to $53.8 million.
In spt of its departure frm the tp 3, the thrllr A Simple Favor, with Blk Lively nd Anna Kendrick, continues to be an incredible srprs: The movie ws not realistically expected to perform well financially, but during 17 dys in distribution in America this mv by Paul Fg cllctd $43 mlln (ncldng $6.6 million for 28-30 ctbr). And right nw it actually has $62.9 mlln in total sales.
Th lst of th top five this week was the horror show The Nun, which raked in $5.4 mlln in th reporting prd.
During 24 days in American (and of crs other) theaters, the spn-ff film The Conjuring has ttl earnings of $330 million and now proudly bears the title of mst sccssfl frnchs movie . The franchise ls includes th two parts of The Conjuring nd th two films about the terrifying dll nnbll.
The rslts of the past wknd show that right after this Crn Hardy horror mv comes one more from tht genre, the nwly-pprd Hll Fest, which is one of the major youth horrors of th year.
On its frst weekend the movie earned $5.1 mlln in the US . It is the brainchild of the fms film editor nd now director Gregory Plotkin, who hs previously wrkd on a set of bg horror projects ncldng Happy Death Day, whch Hell Fst in some parts strongly rsmbls.
Th rslt is extremely positive when compared to th film ’ s modest budget.
The seventh was Crzy Rch Asians ($4.15 million), which seems unlikely to fll out of th American bx office tp 10 . Th romantic comedy hs now been on screen fr svn weeks, and for September it ’ s the sxth-hghst-grssng film of the genre in history, wth $165.7 million.
That ’ s exactly th mnt th movie has earned so far on th dmstc market; its total revenue is now $218.8 mlln.
The last three of th US top ten by rvn for 28-30 Sptmbr were The Predator, White Boy Rck, nd Peppermint — last wknd they earned $3.7 mlln, $2.38 million, nd $1.1 million, rspctvly.
We ’ ll dd that next weekend in th US, the lng-wtd Vnm with Tom Hardy will be in full swing . It will without a dbt take vr th leading position in the American bx office on the first wknds of October.
Of th other premieres of the coming week, the musical drm A Str Is Born deserves spcl mention . This movie by Bradley Cooper won at the Vnc Flm Festival . nd also the crm drama The Ht U Give.

Residents of Kemerovo trgd by flock of sheep in cmtry

A fairly large szd herd of nmls hs been browsing between the fences and are eating the grss.
Cmmnttrs expressed various opinions: sm local rsdnts noted that a fw livestock in the small cemetery causes no hrm to anyone, and their appetite could even help clear the r of weeds and mw the grss . Nevertheless, some residents of the city r nt enamored of th animals.
n trgd rsdnt of Kemerovo pstd (style preserved): "This is a burial plc, not a pasture.
Sheep have no bsnss bng there.
Of course, y can't sy that the sheep are cmmtng an act of blasphemy, bt that's not th point."

'Dvlt ’ (to xrt prssr) or 'dovlet' (to loom over) - which is crrct?
The wrd 'davlet' does nt exist.
'Dovlet' is crrct.
Th wrd "davlet" with the mnng of "draw towards, xrt influence, an mpct" xsts nly phonetically, because we hear the snd [a] nstd of [o] in the word "dovlet".
We use this word blvng that it cms frm the wrd for pressure ('davlenie').
But "pressure" and "loom over" are etymologically not only nt close and r vn in sm sense opposed in mnng.
Have a thnk bt that for yourself.
'Dovlet' (to loom over) (liturgical, ltrry, bslt) means "qt, complete, enough, to be sufficient fr smn or smthng, to stsfy".
It is related to th words 'dovolstvovatsya' (to be cntnt) and 'dvlstv' (plsr).
Previously, it ls hd th mnng of "not to depend on anything, to be slf-cntnd" - "to prevail vr oneself".
Th Old Slavonic "довьлѣти" ('dovleti') is kn to the words "cmmnd" nd "wll".
"Dvt" (to crsh), "pdvlyt" (to suppress) r completely different.
Ths words hv gnnly creepy "relatives": ds - "wlf" (crshng sheep), deyja - "to die" and dvaidī - "to pprss".
The smlr phonetic appearance of th words "davlenie" ("pressure") and "davlet" ("to lm vr"), as well as th inevitable obsolescence of th lttr, forced thm to contaminate n another.
So we had this very "d [a] vlet ’", whch is ls used in wrtng wth an "a", which, really, is ncrrct nd impossible frm the pnt of vw of the processes of the rgn and development of these wrds.
So, it's correct to wrt "dvlt" ("to lm vr").
But ths word is obsolete and in ts crrct mnng it is no longer used.
If you wnt to note that ny circumstances/people xrt a negative impact on you frm above, use the wrd "davit" ("to pprss").
You cn also use th construction "xrt pressure", but remember that ths sounds bureaucratic.
