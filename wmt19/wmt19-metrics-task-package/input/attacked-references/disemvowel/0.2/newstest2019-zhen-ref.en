People ’ s Daily nln, Beijing, November 5 (Wng Xiaoyan) - In the current tide of "mss entrepreneurship and innovation", more and mr technology companies hv begun to py ttntn to patent R & D and related protection wrk, nd deeply xplr the ptntl value of patents to ccpy the market dmntn.
Similarly, many tchnlgy cmpns have encountered numerous infringements crss in ptnt technology licensing and patent technology use.
At th end of 2017, Tn Wei, He Zhanghong and Lai Bn from Guangdong Province, on th grounds of patent infringement, appealed th developer of "Didi Chuxing" PP, Bjng Xiaoju Technology C., Ltd. (hrnftr referred to as Xiaoju Technology), the operator, Dd Chuxing Tchnlgy Co., Ltd. (hereinafter rfrrd to as Dd Chuxing), the seller, Guangdong Pcfc ntrnt Information Services Lmtd (hereinafter rfrrd to as Guangdong Pacific) to th Guangzhou Intellectual Prprty Court.
Th thr plaintiffs requested th court to order tht th three defendants immediately stopped th actions of manufacturing, selling, offering fr sale, and using the plaintiff ’ s patent.
On October 30, 2018, China Jdgmnt Online published the "First-instance Cvl Rlng Paper of Infringement of nvntn Patent Rights between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong nd Beijing Xiaoju Tchnlgy Co., Ltd.", whch disclosed some details of case in whch the Didi Chuxing PP was sued fr patent nfrngmnt.
Th three plaintiffs believe that thy are the patentees nd nvntrs of th "crplng service system nd method based on mbl terminals", nd the whole prtn process of the "ride-sharing" application in the "Didi Chxng" APP corresponds to the technical solution of the patent protection involved in th case, which formed a patent nfrngmnt.
However, during the court ’ s rlng, Xj Technology blvd that Gngdng Pacific ws not an lgbl defendant . It only provided free dwnlds of th involved APP "Didi Chuxing" on the Internet, and did not implement th ptnt mthd involved . Thr was no direct or indirect infringement bhvr, and it should not be ncldd as a defendant in this case.
Secondly, the nfrngmnt of this cs was nt in Guangdong.
According to th lw, th nfrngmnt of the patent involved shld be the place where the patent mthd involved in the case was completely implemented . Therefore, the jurisdiction of the court was chllngd nd the cs ws requested to be transferred to the court of th defendant's domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Prprty Court.
Th Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pcfc provided the alleged infringement Dd Chxng PP prdct on its online pltfrm . It is nt inappropriate for the plaintiff to list Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
And th dfndnt Guangdong Pacific ’ s domicile is located in Guangzhou, under the jurisdiction of the Gngzh ntllctl Property Crt.
Th defendant Xiaoju Technology dvctd that the case be trnsfrrd to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial wth ndqt evidence . The Court dismissed the dfndnt Xj Technology Co., Ltd. ’ s objection to the jurisdiction of the cs, nd ordered it assume the ccptnc fee fr the case.
At present, th other trials of th case hv nt been announced, nd th reporter will pay close attention to the follow-up details of the patent nfrngmnt case of Didi Chuxing.

"Chn ’ s science and technology have developed rapidly in th past few decades, nd Australia and Chn cn achieve fruitful results by going frwrd hand in hand in th scientific field. "
Lrry Marshall, CEO of the Cmmnwlth Scientific and Industrial Rsrch rgnztn sd in an exclusive interview with a reporter from the Chn News Service in Beijing, the cooperation between strl nd China in the fld of science and technology hs shown great vitality from the cprtn in dlng with climate chng to the "Eye of Heaven" project.
As the lrgst national rsrch nstttn in the Commonwealth of Australia, CSIRO has achieved mny world famous nnvtv research results in th flds of ocean, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cprtn with scientific research nstttns such as the Chinese cdmy of Scncs.
"Ths is a lasting friendship that involves the trust of partners nd the trdtn of lng-trm cooperation . ", Mrshll said.
In May of this year, China ’ s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Sphrcl radio Telescope ― Chn ’ s Eye of Hvn, installed th world ’ s frst 19-bm L-bnd receiver.
This internationally mst advanced 19-bm feed src receiver is jointly dvlpd by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall sd tht th successful development of the rcvr is based on CSR ’ s many years of technical ccmltn . When enabled, the FAST survey speed will ncrs by 5 to 6 times, meanwhile mr scientific observation targets wll be expanded.
"Ths is the cntrbtn of CSIRO to FAST. "
In ddtn to the above cooperations, CSIRO is also working clsly wth Chns scientific research institutions in the construction of Sqr Kilometer Array rd telescope, rsrch and development of new fl technologies, energy cnsrvtn and emission reduction.
"In th pst, scientific researches often fcsd on problems after hundreds of yrs, and now more scientific research power is needed to solve th problems in frnt of thm. "
Marshall believed that Australia nd Chn are complementary in the fld of scntfc development, and both cntrs face a srs of challenges in their development progress.
Fr example, extreme weather occurs frequently in the wrld . Drought and floods have ld to a reduction in food prdctn and food shrtgs have seriously ffctd hmn development.
At th same time, population xplsn, aging, chronic disease and thr problems r ls the serious challenges we faced.
"The cooperation btwn Australia and China in recent years has focused on slvng ths crrnt problems. "
Mrshll said that th key job of Center fr Southern Hemisphere cns Research, jointly stblshd by CSIRO nd National Laboratory for Marine Science and Tchnlgy (Qingdao), are observing El Nn phenomenon and La Nina phenomenon, studying the relationships between these two phenomenons and extreme wthr, and stblshng early warning facilities for extreme weather . Th new species of cereals dvlpd by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences can vrcm xtrm weather nd cn also alleviate food shortages caused by xtrm wthr.
"In the crrnt nvrnmnt, tchnlgcl innovation is difficult to accomplish by oneself, it requires extremely high csts, and there r many problems to be slvd, so cprtn is prtclrly important today. "
Marshall expressed tht th closer the cprtn is, the more lkly it is to make breakthroughs . This is also th significance of Australia and China in strengthening cooperation under the framework of th "n Blt One Rd".
"Strengthening bilateral cprtn is mainly for cprtn in science nd technology for us. "
Marshall took the xmpl that CSR has recently developed a gld purification method without using cyanide . Because the traditional cynd gold purification method is vry harmful to th environment, mny cntrs hp to find a way to purify gold with little nvrnmntl pollution.
"We r very willing to ntrdc this technology to Chn . This is n of the achievements of our participation in th "n Belt One Road" cprtn. "

Ri Yong Ho, the foreign minister Nrth Kr, told the United Nations on Strdy tht continued snctns were deepening the distrust of the ntd States on North Kr and it was impossible for North Korea to unilaterally abandon its nclr weapons under sch crcmstncs.
Ri Yong Ho sd on th United Nations General Assembly tht North Korea hd taken "very kind actions" during the last year, ncldng csstn of missile and nuclear tsts, dismantling of nclr tst sites and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear wpns and technologies
"However, we haven ’ t seen ny corresponding response frm the ntd Stts," he said.
"If the ntd States doesn ’ t trust on us, we hv no confidence in our ntnl security . It is impossible fr us to nltrlly bndn th nuclear weapons under sch circumstances. "
Although Ri Yong Ho rptd the complaints of Nrth Korea bt th opposition of United States to "phsd" denuclearization, his speech ws of great significance because it did nt completely refuse the unilateral denuclearization as North Korea hd bfr.
Ri Yong Ho mentioned th jnt sttmnt between Jng-n Kim and Trump on June 12, and at tht tm Jeong-eun Kim grd to work twrds th "denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to protect the scrty of North Korea.
North Kr hs always been skng to formally end the 1950-53 Krn War, but the United States said that North Korea must frstly bndn nuclear weapons.
The ntd States also refused to loose the rqrmnts for the ntrntnl snctns on North Korea.
"The ntd Stts insists on ‘ dnclrztn first ’ and ncrss th pressure of snctns to chv its goals in a high-pressure manner, and even refuses to ss the ‘ declaration of the end of th wr ’," Ri Yong Ho said.
"The thought tht sanctions can make us knl and beg forgiveness is the dydrm of the ppl wh don't know us.
Hwvr, th problem is that such continued sanctions are deepening r distrust. "
Ri Yong Ho dd nt mention the second Trump-Kim smmt plan mentioned by the US President earlier this wk at the United Ntns.
On the contrary, he emphasized the thr mtngs between Jeong-eun Kim and Mn J-n, th South Korean Prsdnt over the past five months and sd, "If th other side of dnclrztn is Sth Korea, but not North Korea, then th denuclearization of th Korean Peninsula will not become so deadlocked. "
China nnncd tht it wll rdc import tariffs on 1,585 tax items from November 1, 2018.
Since ths year, China has tkn the initiative to reduce import trffs.
On My 1 this year, the drug ws flly tax-deducted, and ll import trffs for ll 28 tx items of gnrl taxable drugs, including anticancer drugs, and alkaloid drugs with anticancer effects, and Chinese ptnt medicines with actual imports, were djstd to zero.
At the sm time, it has also greatly reduced the production nd import lnks value-added tx burden of anti-cancer drgs.
On Jly 1, tx reductions were imposed on 218 tx items of cars nd parts.
ftr the tax reduction, the fnshd automobile tax rate of China ’ s tmbl has been lower thn the vrg level of developing cntrs, which is in line with th actual sttn of China ’ s tmbl industry.
This tax reduction will drive the restructuring of th industry and th optimal llctn of rsrcs, accelerate th survival of the fttst to help improve th quality of products and services . It is expected to promote the adjustment of tmbl prices to a certain xtnt, so tht cnsmrs can get mr benefits.
On July 1, tx reductions were mpsd on 1449 tax tms of dly consumer goods.
Th tx reduction on daily consumer goods is closely bnd up with people ’ s need of bttr lives.
This tm ’ s tax reduction not only nvlvs lts of tms but ls has strong dynamics, wth an average tax reduction of 56%.
The reduction of taxes on daily consumer gds directly bnfts th consumers and promotes th competitiveness of domestic industries.
Nvmbr 1, tax reductions will be imposed on 1585 industrial product tax tms of lctrmchncl devices, prts and rw materials.
pprprtly reducing th import tariffs of some domestically ndstrl products wth urgent nds can attract more foreign capital, help increase domestic effective spply, ssst industrial upgrading, and contribute to ntrprss allocate rsrcs on a global scale, reduce production costs, and ls bnft for rdcng the pressure on the domestic environment.
Relevant prsn in charge of Customs Tariff Cmmssns Office of the State Council introduced that th bv four tms nttv tax reduction and the thrd step tax reduction implemented on this year ’ s Jly 1 in accordance with the results of th expansion of the information technology agreement ngttn will rslt in the overall trff lvl fell from lst year ’ s 9.8% to 7.5%.
The adjusted overall tariff level is slightly higher thn tht of the EU, lower thn most developing countries, at a mdrtly lw level, and basically mtchs China ’ s developing cntry status and development stg.
ccrdng to the person in charge, as one of the mprtnt ndctrs of the degree of openness in China ’ s trade in goods sector, th overall lvl of trffs should be cmptbl wth the stage of China ’ s economic development nd reflect th chrctrstcs of the times.
China ’ s trade in goods scale rnks frst in th world, nd it has already had the economic foundation to further xpnd its pnnss . Hwvr, there is still a gap between the quality nd efficiency of trade development cmprd wth developed cnms . Thrfr, the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately lowered.
Tariff is a kind of protect mns for compliance . The level of trff should be compatible wth ndstrl cmpttvnss to encourage healthy competition . While overprotection gs against the industry dvlpmnt nd quality improvement.
Tariff rate djstmnt must balance production needs wth cnsmr demands.
Focus on reducing the commodity tax rate that has a large domestic demand nd cntrbts to the transformation and pgrdng of the industry, and strvng to ncrs the import of chrctrstc dvntg products with relatively concentrated needs of the ppl, continuously improving the sense of gn of enterprises and the public, nd meeting the upgrading nds of th industrial strctr nd consumption structure.
The tax reduction should balance the financial rvn and the affordability of ndstrl dvlpmnt.
In th chc of specific tax-reduction commodities and rng of tx rdctns, we must plan and coordinate the dmstc and international markets, th upstream and dwnstrm spcts, production and consumption relationship, and maintain the stdy development of China ’ s economy.
The principal strssd that this yr is the 40th anniversary of reform and opening up . China ’ s nttv to reduce th vrll level of import tariffs is a mjr measure based on China ’ s own needs to achieve high-quality development . It is conducive to th overall plnnng and utilization of ntrntnl and frgn rsrcs to promote the qlty of domestic supply systms nd meet the upgrading consumption nds of people.
This action nd msr shows tfhat Chn will constantly prs an opening up strategy of mutual bnft and win-win result, firmly support economic globalization, steadfastly phld th principle of free trade rule nd the mltltrl trading systm centered on the WT, and continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the wrld to also allow China ’ s development to bttr benefit the wrld.
Serbia announced to enter th tp defense readiness condition . Srbn President and Russian President wll meet to dscss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
Yugoslav news agency reported by quoting sources frm the ffc of Serbian President that Vcc, the Serbian President, gv orders that the Srbn armed forces entered the top dfns rdnss condition in consideration of the fct that Kosovo spcl troops had occupied the rdwy to the ccmltn lk of Gazivoda hydropower station under th control of Belgrade in northern Kosovo.
On September 29, Vulin, the Dfns Minister of Srb, announced that the Serbian army ntrd the overall defense rdnss cndtn.
Vulin mphszd that Serbia would continue to monitor th current situation in Kosovo as long as Vucic's rdrs wr still effective . Regardless of th drctn in which the situation dvlps, the Serbian army wll respond accordingly.
It was rprtd by th Tass news agency of Russia that Vucic said in an interview on Sptmbr 29 tht he had ntfd the ntd Stts, Russia, Europe nd other sides about th current situation, and wld vst Moscow on October 2 to meet with Putin, the President of Russia, to seek Ptn's support on the Kosovo ss.
When he was asked whether Srb needed to get the mltry support from Rss like Syria, Vcc gv a ngtv answer: "I don't want a sgnfcnt military cnflct in our territory. "
Vucic ls sd that the Serbian rmy ntrd the vrll dfns readiness condition just for the sake of dtrrnc to prevent the conflict . However, it was a clear wrnng: Serbia would nvr tolerate any violent action in Kosovo.
Th Serbian rmy pgrdd the defense readiness condition in connection with the two ctns in Kosovo.
According to the sttmnt of Serbia, th Albanian people were carrying out the mass rrsts of Srbn people, wh had been living there for gnrtns, in rcnt dys, but these arrested Serbian people ddn't break any laws.
Vucic said tht since Marko Juric, the hd of the Serbian government's ffc for Kosovo and Metohija, was beaten nd dtnd by the lbnn army in Kosovo, th Albanian people constantly escalated the issues in th region and crrd out the nhmn arrests and dprttns of the Serbian people.
Furthermore, over 100 people, including the mmbrs of ROSU special army of th Department of the Interior of th slf-dclrd Rpblc of Kosovo, armed plc, nd snipers, occupied the battle field nr the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station, entered the ecological sport cntr near the dam in northern Kosovo, nd blocked ll rds nearby . Ths areas were originally ndr the cntrl of Serbia.
Vucic indicated tht Kosovo was encouraged by the western countries to make ths mltry adventure . Snc the Kosovo army hd taken actions wtht notifying Serbia in advance, it violated the rules in Paragraph 1 in Chapter 9 of "Brussels Agreement", and it also brchd th UN Security Council Rsltn 1244 nd the mltry tchnlgy agreement between Serbia and Ksv.
Vucic had spoken to Stoltenberg, th NATO Secretary-General, to criticize th western cntrs for their fls words on the Ksv issue.
Th source of current conflict ws still the historical grievances lasting for hundreds of years between Serbian ppl and lbnn people in Ksv.
Fr the ownership of Ksv, Srbn people and Albanian people had different opinions.
Serbia considered Ksv as th brthplc of its ntn nd th crdl of culture, because Serbia had built ts most powerful cntry here in the 12th cntry . However, the Albanian people settled hr in large numbers only after the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbian army retreated to the north.
Th Albanian ppl insisted that the llyrn people of the primitive trb located at Kosovo in the 4th-5th century wr their ancestors . Therefore, Ksv had been the Albanian ppl's territory since ancient tms.
The sbjctv political dvsns contributed to the sharp conflicts between different nations, religions and cultures, resulting in th frc cnfrnttn between Serbian people nd Albanian ppl in Kosovo.
Th Albanian people in Kosovo frst dclrd the independence of Albania in 1912.
After the First World Wr, a large nmbr of lbnn people, wh were lvng in the Balkan Pnnsl, moved to Turkey . The proportion of Serbian people was relatively rsng . The actions of "tkng back their own lands" in the sight of the Serbian people were considered as the predations of th "Greater Serbian Nationalism" by Albanian ppl . The cntrdctn btwn th two ntns ntnsfd.
Kosovo became th "pwdr keg" of Balkan.
Th Albanian separatists in Kosovo lbrtn army nd the Serbian army and plc nggd in armed conflicts in 1999, which ld to the NATO troops bombed the Federal Rpblc of Yugoslavia consisting of Srb and Montenegro . The Ksv War broke out.
Kosovo unilaterally declared ts independence frm Srb on February 17, 2008.
Thereafter, the news cm out that Serbia and Kosovo would normalize rltns, nd sign a glbl nd legally binding grmnt . Hwvr, d to the historical grvncs btwn the two nations and the geopolitical constraints, they failed to sign the grmnt, which was in the control of different forces, including th United Stts, Europe and Russia.
Just a mnth ago, Vucic made it clr for the first time that he insisted to separate Serbian people from lbnn ppl in Ksv . It exposed th conflict between th tw nations again.

Thousands of Beijing residents cldn't help to change tactics to show thr pictures on social pltfrms and constantly mk status updates to show their happinesses . They said that "the most beautiful skyline wth a blue sky nd white clouds ws th bst bsnss card of Beijing".
Bjng had met th "bluest sky" since gst.
It could be found anywhere in Beijing at any time tht many residents were holding thr smrt phones or DSLR cmrs to take pctrs.
On social platforms, such as the microblog and WCht Moments, ppl could see th different beauty of th mprl Palace, Tian An Men, th Brd's Nest, Hutong, and various bldngs against the blue sky in the net frnds' cmrs.
Some net friends sd that such "landscape pictures" were the best city images of Beijing; and sm net friends joked that if the blue sky rmn th same fr a lng time, the patients wth crvcl spondylosis would surely be cured; some net friends even hpd that "the bl sky wld last thrgh the winter, sprng nd summer, providing Beijing with a blue sky across fr ssns".
Why did th residents in Beijing prtclrly lk to show the blue sky?
That's bcs thy had been suffering from th fog and haze in this city in the pst . They lkd forward to the blue sky eagerly . After strtng the "Blue Sky Protection Cmpgn" in Beijing to cntnsly improve the air quality, there were lss fog and hz, but more bl skies . The residents wr jyfl to see this . And thy flt so happy with it.
The wthr ws fine in Beijing on National Day.

The photography cmpttn with th theme of th "bluest sky" voluntarily organized by the rsdnts on social pltfrms was still under way.

Th real-time concentration of PM2.5 ws even less than 10 in Sptmbr.
The major fctr contributing to the "blst sky" ws th overall fvrbl meteorological conditions in recent days . And more mprtntly, Beijing had persistently carried out th air pollution control . It hd vigorously prmtd th Cln Air Action Plan in the past five years, and the environmental benefits wr rlsd cntnsly resulting in the reduction of total pollutant emission in the region . These laid the foundation for continuous mprvmnt of air qlty.
Beijing released ffclly and mplmntd the "2013-2017 Cln Air ctn Plan in Beijing" in 2013.
ccrdng to this plan, the authority would continue to gd the alleviation of functions unrelated to its status as ntnl cptl, and prmtd the works of clean nrgy substitutions and pollutants dschrg reductions . 4923 coal fired boilers wr lmntd in total.

Crrntly, the infant mrtlty rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71‰, whch is significantly lower than th ntnl average lvl and has reached the advanced level of dvlpd countries.
The "Prognosis Quality mprvmnt Project of NC Hospitalized Prmtr nfnts in China" has significantly improved th survival quality of premature nfnts through four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yun, the director of NICU of Children's Hospital of Fdn University tld the rprtr that it was of great significance for th improvement of premature infants' overall srvvl qlty and population quality to pay attention to th reduction of premature infants' srvvl quality, rdc th complication rates, mprv th nrdvlpmntl prognosis, and mprv th overall outcome of baby patients while improving the survival rate of premature infants . It ws an mprtnt prblm of cncrn to the pediatric and neonatal departments at hm and abroad, and it ws also a crtcl issue in this project.
Th "Prgnss Quality mprvmnt Prjct of NC Hsptlzd Premature Infants in China" has included tens of thousands of css of premature infants of 33 weeks and less gestation in China and hs contributed to 1/3 reduction of the mortality rt of prmtr infants of minimum gsttn nd smll birth weight through four years of unremitting efforts . At the sm time, the svr complication rt of premature infants has been significantly reduced and the survival qlty of premature infants has bn greatly improved.
This project has established a set of cmplt, systematic and ffctv collaborative quality mprvmnt methods, which are suitable fr our domestic conditions and will collaboratively improve the prognosis of premature nfnts and improve the lvl of neonatal care by sttng up the ntnl cllbrtn ntwrk of ntnl quality improvement, introducing th concepts of collaborative quality improvement, nd combing 25 cooperative hospitals in Chn.
Children's Hospital of Fudan University is cnnctng the frcs of neonatal dprtmnts crss the cntry, and developing th gdlns for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on th xprnc ccmltd in the prjct in order to provide reference and guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections.
It is rprtd that in the "Prognosis Qlty Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China", th pediatric hsptls hs introduced th EPIQ mthds into 25 large NICU in 19 provinces in order to solve the dstrbng prblm of neonatal infections in Chn NICU.
After more than 10 yrs of cnstnt improvement, th survival rate of premature infants without cmplctns in Canada has ncrsd by about 1/3 . Cnd is now one of th cntrs wth the best prognosis in premature infants in the world.
The PQ methods have bn wdly applied to all NICUs in Canada, and have bn adopted by 6 thr countries.
ccrdng to th pediatric hospital, the rsrch results shw that ftr implementing the EPIQ intervention for two years, th infection rt of premature infants will drp by 35%, and the sg rate of antibiotics will drop by 20%.
In the future, Children's Hsptl of Fudan nvrsty will continue to promote nd mplmnt these methods in the whl country, mng at comprehensively reducing the ccrrnc rates of ll complications in premature infants nd mprvng the quality of treatment for newborns in China.
At present, it is an indisputable fct tht there r differences and inequalities in th lvl of treatment in various regions in China.
According to Prfssr C Yun's ntrdctn, the pediatric hospital will ply a leading role as an important construction unit of Chldrn's Ntnl Medical Cntr . Ths project covers Xnjng, Guizhou, Gns, Shaanxi and many other western provinces, with th gl of gradually promoting the hmgnztn and standardization of neonatal treatment throughout the country.
It is reported that Children's Hsptl of Fdn University is connecting the frcs of nntl dprtmnts across the country, and developing the guidelines fr the diagnosis and trtmnt of neonatal infections bsd on the experience ccmltd in the project in order to prvd reference and guidance fr the standard diagnosis nd treatment of neonatal infections.
It hs bn revealed that the coordination cntr's Chinese Neonatal Network located at Children's Hsptl of Fudan University will unite 63 hsptls across China to carry t th nxt stg of national qlty improvement in 2019, with the goal of prmtng the homogenization of neonatal treatment in China.

Xin Shiping: Bld the "mnmnt of heroes" in the heart - wrttn on the ffth Memorial Dy.
On September 30, on the v of the 69th birthday of the People's Republic of China, we ushered in th ffth Memorial Day . Xi Jnpng and thr Prty and state ldrs came to the Tian'anmen Sqr to attend th crmny for presenting flower bskts to the people's heroes.
At ths moment, pls pay tribute to the hrs wherever you are.
The Memorial Day is not only fr reviving, bt also fr awakening.
Lk back th rch hstry, every martyr ’ s name represents a fresh life.
Thy ls have fiery youth, sincere lv and caring families.
Hwvr, for the belief that "the dctrn we believe in is the truth of the universe", and for th prps to "spare the sffrng of the nxt gnrtn", they are willing to scrfc vrythng.
"I wld cry for China in ch dy of my life".
Thrgh tm and space, the heroes set up sprtl signposts to guide the way frwrd.
"Whr do you come from and whr do y go? "; "What kind of man y want to be? "; It's nt hard to have th nswrs if you understand the hrs.
In mmry of heroes, th mst important thng is to build a "monument of heroes" in th heart.
ccrdng to th incomplete statistics, since the rvltnry wrtm, around 20 mlln martyrs have died heroically for ntnl independence, liberation of the people and prosperity of th country.
Due to various rsns, many mrtyrs don ’ t even leave their nms.
Countless hrs and mrtyrs enrich dls with bld, prctc faith with life . To remember their names nd inherit their spirit, is to protect the nation's root nd soul.
This "mnmnt of hrs" can nt be stained or damaged.
For some tm, the historical nihilism, abused ntrtnmnt nd other undercurrents emerge.
All sorts of actions that distort nd disparage heroes and martyrs, challenge just cnscnc, derange value judgments, and cs the pblc ndgntn nd vigilance of the whl society.
Heroes and martyrs cn not be desecrated, and heroes cn nt be forgotten.
We can nt let actions that touch the bottom line drft . We must dr to shw our sword and phld the dignity of heroes with rule of lw nd justice.
On May 1, the lw for the protection of heroes nd martyrs came nt frc.
From th perspective of judicial practice, the verdict of some css is to the satisfaction of th msss, which not only effectively mntns the glorious image of heroes in accordance with th law, but ls releases the pstv nrgy for respecting heroes and mrtyrs.
A nation wth pursuits cn not live wtht heroes, nd a cntry with ideals cannot live without pioneers.
It has become a common social consensus to recall th mrtyrs and cll fr heroes.
Crrntly, there are mllns of mmrl fclts of various kinds in China, and more thn 100 million people visit the martyrs' cmtry every year.
The hearts of the people are the strngst ftstns.
Let advocating heroes, defending heroes, learning from hrs and caring heroes prevail, and let the spirit of heroes merge into the ntnl bld . The "mnmnt of hrs" will stnd frmly btwn sky and earth and deep in the hrts of th people.

The ffcls and diplomats of th European Cmmssn still hoped that mrkt forces would persuade Italy to adjust its budget plan bfr Italy ffclly submitted it to th European Commission in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, th euro fell to its lwst level in nearly two weeks on Frdy, whl the Italian bond yields ht thr highest level in three wks.
If the deficit goal remained nchngd bfr the deadline in ctbr, the European Cmmssn mght veto th Italian drft budget, which has never been done to any country by the European Commission.

Nrly 1,000 ntnl scenic spots have cut ticket prcs nd the dcrsng amplitude of more than half of them is over 20%
[Abstract] As of Sptmbr 28, various rgns have introduced nd mplmntd, or issued a document to publish to th public for measures of free or reduced-price opening for 981 scenic spots (74 spots fr free nd 907 spots for price rdctn). Th prcs have bn reduced in the scnc spots in Yunnan Stn Forest, the Dali Thr Pagodas, the Jd Dragon Snw Mountain, the Lijiang River in Gln, Guangxi, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, Terracotta Army in Shnx, Mount Sanqingshan in Jngx and Kns in Xnjng.
In order to implement the deployment of the dcsn of the Central cnmc Wrkng Cnfrnc and the Government Work Report, th National Development and Reform Commission issued th Guiding Opinions on Improving th Formation Mechanism of Ticket Prices in State-owned Scenic Spts and Reducing Ticket Prices in Key State-owned Scenic Spots (hereinafter rfrrd to as the Guiding Opinions) on Jn 28, rqrng to improve the frmtn mchnsm of ticket prcs in state-owned scenic spots in terms of reasonable definition of th composition of ticket pricing costs, nnvtv prc management mthds nd strct implementation pricing prcdrs, to ensure to achieve remarkable results for reducing the relatively high tckt prices in key state-owned scnc spts by the end of Sptmbr.
Various regions hv actively carried out wrk ccrdng to the deployment requirements and reduced a btch of key state-owned scnc spot ticket prices.
As of September 28, various rgns hv introduced and implemented, or issued a document to pblsh to th public for msrs of fr or reduced-price opening for 981 scenic spts (74 spts fr fr nd 907 spots for price reduction). Among them, there are 159 5A scenic spts and 534 4A scenic spots, wth a ttl of 693 nd accounting for 70.6%.
Among 907 scnc spots whch have rdcd prcs, the nmbr of the attractions wth the decreasing mpltd of more than 20% is 491, accounting fr 54.3% and the nmbr of the ttrctns with the decreasing amplitude of mr than 30% is 214, accounting for 23.6%.
Yunnan, Shandong, Guangxi, Shaanxi and thr prvncs have a rltvly large nmbr of price rdctn scenic spts, of which the nmbr of prc rdctn scenic spots in Yunnan is more than 100, wth an overall decreasing amplitude of more than 30%.
Th governments of Anhui, Chongqing nd thr six provinces (districts or cities) hv all reduced prices for 5A scenic spts.
The prices have been rdcd in the scnc spots wth high social ttntn in Yunnan Stone Forest, th Dali Three Pgds, the Jd Dragon Snow Mountain, the Lijiang Rvr in Guilin, Gngx, Fujian Wuyi Mntn, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, Terracotta Army in Shaanxi, Mount Sanqingshan in Jiangxi nd Kanas in Xnjng.
The ticket prices of ky state-owned scenic spts are gradual returning to the reasonable range, which is conducive to promoting th tourism industry to accelerate th transformation and pgrdng frm ticket economy to industrial economy, from mnrty tourism to mass tourism and frm scnc spot tourism to all-for-one trsm, as well as conducive to forming a virtuous crcl of optimization of the supply structure of tourism industry and stdy expansion of th dmnd for tourism consumption, and promoting th sustainable and hlthy dvlpmnt of scnc spots nd tourism industry.
The National Development and Reform Commission also emphasizes that various regions should strngthn th rgltn of price order in scenic spots, guide scenic spots to mprv thr srvcs, and ensure to rdc prcs without reducing quality.
Mrvr, fr the prblms tht th decreasing amplitude of ticket prices in some scenic spots is too smll and so-called reduction but no practical reduction recently rprtd by the md, the National Dvlpmnt and Reform Cmmssn has made a special nspctn to rqr various regions to srsly solve the problems, timely respond to the social concerns, and effectively implement prc reductions.

National wide flm-fr cotton on-site observation nd dscssn exchange activities experts wlk into tst fields, listen to the situation presentation from CAE Yu Shuxun academician tm representative.
Chn News Service, Xnjng, Xyr, September 30 (Gng Dandan, Wang Xiaojun) - Located in th Xayar Cnty of Xnjng, the cotton planted in film-free cotton planting tst bs has a breathtaking growth . Compared wth the film cttn next to it, it is not inferior in any respect . A cluster of snow-white cttn cmpts "blmng" nd is full of branches.
From September 27 to 28, the nationwide film-free cttn n-st observation and discussion exchange activities were hld in Xyr County, Xnjng.
The reporter lrnd at the observation meeting tht the film-free cotton tchnlgy system with "Chinese Cttn 619" and its spprtng cltvtn msrs as the main body has initially achieved the goal of film-free planting in cttn fields, reducing the pollution of the Xinjiang cttn field film residue to the clgcl environment and rw cotton . nd flm-fr cttn integrated technology ’ s research and demonstration have achieved sgnfcnt progresses.
Academician Yu Shxn, cdmcn of the Chinese cdmy of ngnrng, fms cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the national modern grcltrl industrial technology system ’ s cttn system, introduced th grwth of film-free cotton for Zhou Gm, secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang A & F nvrsty.
"The comprehensive technology of the film-free cttn dvlpd by us can completely realize the cotton planting without th flm, and can cmpltly solve the prblm of residual film pollution nd realize green cttn planting. "
Yu Shxn described, an cdmcn of the Chns Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is China ’ s most mprtnt cotton-producing rgn . According to the Ntnl Bureau of Sttstcs, the cotton planting area in Xinjiang in 2017 ws 35 mlln mu, accounting for 61% of the ntnl cttn r.
Since the introduction of mulching film in Chn in 1982, the flmd area of various types of crps in Xinjiang has rchd mr than 50 mlln mu, and th annual use of mlchng flm is about 30 million tons.
Among them, cotton mulching film coverage rate reached 100%, nd cotton fld mlchng flm accounted for bt 60% of Xnjng film use.
Use flm-fr cttn for prdctn measurement, and the cotton output can be flly realized from 320 kg to 350 kg pr mu.
With the increasing mnt of mlchng film input in Xinjiang, the rsdl film recovery rt is low, the residual film volume in th soil is gradually increased, and the soil structure damages and other problems caused by rsdl flm seriously ffcts th sustainable dvlpmnt of agriculture.
The residual film nt only causes serious pollution to th sl, but ls has a great influence on the quality of cttn fiber.
Crrntly, more than n-thrd of the cotton flds in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized hrvstng.
In 2017, Xinjiang mchnzd harvesting r is bt 14 million mu.
In the prcss of cotton mchnzd hrvstng, a large amount of brkn film on earth surface nd the cotton plant are picked up . The broken film doped in the raw cotton is difficult to remove drng the processing of rw cttn, and cn nt be completely rmvd in the subsequent textile processing prcss, seriously affecting the qlty of textile products.
On September 28, the nationwide film-free cttn on-site observation and discussion exchange ctvts wr hld in Xayar County, Xnjng.
In rdr to slv the cotton mulching film plltn, simplify th cttn planting tchnlgy and improve th cotton field efficiency, Yu Shuxun led his team to use 8 years to mplmnt th "Chinese Cotton 619" film-free cttn technology plntng, ddng "advantages" to Xinjiang ’ s agricultural green development.
Yu Shuxun ntrdcd, wth th new idea of innovative breeding, they cultivate a nw line of extra early ripening, saline-alkaline tlrnc, low temperature resistant, and high yld upland cttn "Chinese Cttn 619".
"‘ Chinese Cotton 619 ’ has chvd a srs of spprtng msrs such as film-free seeding machinery, improved seeding depth, shallow buried in drip irrigation zone, stbl sdng density scrnng, and reasonable chemical regulation under the cndtn of film-free cltvtn in southern Xnjng. "
At present, Aksu, Korla, Alear and thr places hv stblshd a demonstration base for film-free cotton, wth a yield of 4,800 kg pr hctr.
Film-free cotton plntng hs achieved high yield, cost savings, nvrnmntl protection and mprvd overall benefits.
Zhang Donghai, an agronomist at th Third Dvsn of th grcltrl Science Research Institute of Xinjiang Production nd Construction Corps, said that thrgh nrly sx yrs of research and demonstration of film-free cotton cltvtn techniques, the production of film-free cttnsd cotton can flly chv 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, and may even be higher.
"The promotion of flm-fr cotton cultivation tchnlgy has great prspcts. "
Zhang Donghai believes tht at present, the film-free cotton cltvtn technology can cmpltly solve the problem of soil residual film plltn, but thr is stll a certain gp between the current cnmc bnfts and the cultivation of mulching film.
"The support of cotton purchasing prc wll be conducive to future prmtn. "
Yu Shuxun said that in the nxt step, he and his tm wll continue to cndct n-dpth research and large-scale promotion and application of th film-free cotton, mkng the industry of film-free cotton larger nd stronger, nd cmpltly solving the problem of soil pollution caused by th film.

ccrdng to the sbsdry arrangement of the trade agreement published on Monday, th new .S. -Mexico-Canada trade agreement wll retain the President Trump's ability to implement th thrt to impose a 25% tariff on imported cars, while ssntlly exempting passenger cars, pickup trcks nd auto parts imported from Canada nd Mexico frm paying tariffs.

Dspt lack of details, the bvs progress mentioned above is enough to prompt the Mexican and mrcn governments to abruptly stop publishing the text of the tw-prty trade grmnt nd give Canada mr time to jn the agreement.
Andres Manuel Lpz Obrador, the Mexican president-elect, told the reporters in Mexico that the .S. government had made new counter-proposals to th Cndn government nd said he would continue to rg ths thr cntrs to participate in NAFTA.

ccrdng to foreign md rprts, it was hrd for people to find nythng unusual in two lttl lions plyng in a cnsrvtn center located in the suburb in Pretoria, the capital of South Africa, but they were bsltly unique.
University of Pretoria nnncd: "They are the first lions in the hstry, whch are born by artificial nsmntn--the frst pair of lns in th world. "
The scientists of the nvrsty were cmmttng themselves to studying the rprdctv system of female frcn lions.
Ganswindt, th director of Mammal Institute of University of Pretoria, said that ths two little lns born on gst 25 were a female ln nd a male ln . They were prtty healthy and quite normal.
After the intensive tests in 18 mnths, his team finally md ths breakthrough.
Gnswndt said in a md interview: "We collected th sprms from a healthy male lion. "
Next, the rsrchrs wtd fr the hormones in the fml lion to reach a prpr level so as to conduct th artificial insemination in it.
Gnswndt said: "Frtntly, the rslt turned out to be successful. "
He said tht the researchers "tried mny times, but to thr surprise, it ddn't take much ffrt".
He said tht the above-mentioned research breakthrough could be verified repeatedly, and the scientists hpd to s this technology to save th endangered bg cts.
Th International nn for Conservation of Nature indicated tht the lion had already become extinct in 26 frcn countries, and the total nmbr of srvvl wld lions had declined sharply by 43% in the past 20 yrs with only bt 20,000 wild lns left.
The frcn ln was lstd as vulnerable by this organization.
Ganswindt said: "This nml will be in dngr of xtnctn if we do nthng for them. "
He said that wth this kind of new technology, it's not ncssry for th lions to be fd . The sprms could be njctd into the bds of female lions, just like the approach adopting on th elephants in cptvty in Nrth America and Europe.

In the North Korea-US Joint Statement of Singapore, the two sds promised to bld a new North Korea-US rltn, which complied wth the tw ppls' wishes of looking forward to pc and prsprty.
On one sd, the ntd States increased the ntnsty of snctns, but on the other side, it asked fr th dialogue . Undoubtedly, ts actions were self-contradictory.

EU my Rch Crude Oil Purchase Agreement with Iran
The US government nnncd tht it will rstrt a new round of sanctions against Iran in November and even rg other countries to rdc mprts of Iran oil.
Hwvr, the mrcn allies did not seem to tk the advice.
According to th US "Nw York Tms", on 29th, drng the ntrvw, Zarif, Foreign Minister of Iran, revealed that although the ntd Stts threatened to sanction any country tht does bsnss wth Iran, Thrn is approaching to reach an agreement on the sale of crude oil wth EU.
The core prps of this agreement is to try to stblsh a nw pymnt mechanism, which is to replace the dllr transaction in the frm of barter or domestic crrncy.
The prps of this pprch is to bypss the United States and prevent the United Stts frm impeding financial transfers.
Mnwhl, although the EU is working on facilitating the grmnt, sm French nd Brtsh officials are also worried that if the grmnt is concluded, it wll be the most vrt cnfrnttn between the EU and the United States against the US withdrawal frm th Iran nuclear deal.
Th US md sd that in the one hr ntrvw, Zarif ’ s words sounded more optimistic than in recent months.
Because the grmnt cn "strp" the traditional American allies nd ffctvly break the US ’ s attempts to cut rn ’ s income.
"Ths can guarantee that we can sell l nd obtain bnfts", Zarif believed . According to th agreement rchd in 2015, ch country has th legal rights to make trade contacts with Iran.
The hd of Union for Foreign ffrs Policy, Federica Mogherini, ls said recently tht "no svrgn state or organization cn accept other people to decide who they can trade wth. "
Hwvr, she also predicted tht before the US government carried t the next step of sanctions in November, US leaders could adopt a srs of financial instruments md at banks, businessmen nd countries tht hv commercial intercourses with Thrn.
In May of ths year, the US government nltrlly announced its withdrawal frm the rn nclr deal on the grounds that th agreement had dfcncs, saying that the agreement could not prmnntly prhbt Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US thn thrtnd to ban cmpns that buy Iran oil and other commodities frm doing business in the United Stts.
Ths threat forced sm companies to leave Thrn and made the Iranian currency drppd sharply.
Companies such as Airbus S..S . nd French oil giant Total have cnclld bllns of dollars in investment in rn.
Brtsh nd French ffcls said, the US gvrnmnt may "take the lead".
Unsurprisingly, according to a recent rprt by the Turkish media, th US snctns did not sm to have a mjr impact on Iran ’ s oil xprts.
Recently, rn Oil Minister Zanganeh disclosed tht no cntry other than South Korea has stopped buying rn oil.
Bth Zarif nd Iran Prsdnt Rhn believed that the prps of a series of US ctns is to "seduce" Iran ’ s breach of the agreement.
Zarif also regarded the US srl blast as not worthy of consideration . When asked if the US wld overthrow th current rnn gvrnmnt wth ncrsng fnncl pressure, Zarif even laughed . "It is a regime change strtgy, and this is the true prps of th US. "

The reporter learned from the National Health Commission that the prevalence of mlntrtn in r chldrn and adolescents hd reduced but the prvlnc of overweight-obesity hd significantly increased comparing to dcds ago.
The expert pntd t that the most important concept to maintain a healthy wght ws th "prvntv treatment of disease". The scntfc fitness and rational diet should be vigorously promoted.
ccrdng to the "Core Information on Health dctn of Chns dlscnts and ntrprttn (2018 vrsn)" released by the National Health Commission recently, the key to maintain a healthy weight was th rtnl diet and scientific mvmnt.
Th overweight, bsty and blind weight rdctn were harmful to health.
Th health hazard behind the "chbby children" couldn't be gnrd.
Ding Gangqiang, the head of National Institute fr Nutrition and Hlth of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight-obesity cld harm the adolescents' nrml grwth and development, hv a negative mpct on their mntlty, behavior, cognition and ntllgnc, nd even cause hypertension, hyperglycemia and hyprlpdm in chldrn.
And the adolescents' overweight-obesity mght continue into adulthood, whch would increase th dlscnts' risk of having chrnc diseases, such as hypertension and dbts in thr adulthood.
Ding Gngqng said that the overweight rate was 9.6% nd the obesity rate was 6.4% among Chinese children nd adolescents of 6-17 years old according to th Nutrition nd Health Stts Inspection of Chns Residents in 2010-2012 . The sm of these tw rts was 16%.

Zhang Li, the dpty drctr of Scnc Fitness nd Health Prmtn Rsrch Center of General Administration of Sport of China, indicated tht the primary causes of adolescent obesity at present were excessive caloric ntk nd inadequate physical activity.
For this kind of simple bsty, we should ly emphasis on scntfc movement and reasonable dt control.
Zhang Li pointed t that the most important concept to maintain a healthy weight ws th "preventive treatment of dss", nd an integral part of it was to cndct the all-round science popularization education of schools, parents nd students, popularize the dngrs of vrwght nd obesity, and increase th dlscnts' self-protection awareness.
The adolescents should take the periodic physical examination to mntr the growth nd development index, such as height nd wght, so tht th problems of vrwght and obesity could be discovered early nd determined scientifically to tk intervention measures in time.
For those adolescents who are already overweight and obese, Dng Gangqiang dvsd that strvtn therapy or sm-strvtn therapy should be avoided to control and ls wght in addition to the active and scientific rrngmnt of diet and movement snc the adolescents are in a special physlgcl stage . They shld not take drugs blndly to lose wght.

Chn Nws Service, Yichang, October 1 (rprtd by Guo Xiaoying and L Mn)--The newly revised "Thr Gorges-Gezhouba Hydro Project Navigation Scheduling Rgltn" (hereinafter referred to as "Scheduling Regulation") was ffclly enforced strtng from October 1 . After two years of nvgtn test, the Three Gorges ship lift ws officially schdld together with th nvgtn lock in a nfd way.
On th first day of nfrcng the new regulations, th navigation in Thr Gorges-Gezhouba waters was in good rdr.
Thr Gorges Navigation Authority released th first pln of scrty check at 21:00 on September 30, nd crrd out the scrty check on 160 ships, with 124 ships passing the security check.
The nvgtn authority arranged the frst lckng pln after th enforcement of new regulations at 14:00 on October, 1.
After the enforcement of nw regulations, th plan of security chck wld be rlsd once vry dy at 9:00 and 21:00, and the plan of passing dam would be rlsd once vry day at 14:00 and 20:00, so that the shps could flexibly arrange the plan of pssng dam.
The "Classification Control" scheduling principle of shp passing dam was ddd in the "Scheduling Regulation". Th priority of ship passing dm wld be determined according to the functional lclztn of nvgtn lock and ship lift rspctvly . The short-term pssngr ship passing dam would be adjusted to be in th same prrty as th demonstration ship nd integrity ship.
This is also the official scheduling of shp lift nd navigation lock after th two-year navigation test of shp lft.
It was also the first time for big length-width demonstration shp and new energy driven ship of Chuanjiang Rvr nd Three Grgs Reservoir Region to be rnkd in th prrty.
At the same tm, th "nvgtn schdlng mngmnt waters" were djstd from the 180-kilometer waters cls to dam to th 541.8-klmtr waters frm Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to Shishou Yangtze River Brdg in the "Schdlng Regulation". And the "core waters", "wtr close to dam", "control wtrs" and "scheduling waters" were divided.
This ctn would help the ship choose the proper waters to wait fr crssng the lock, vdng excessive ships waiting for crossing the lck in th dam region.
The "Scheduling Regulation" also put forward th measures of ntgrty constraint for th rule-breaking shps according to th current characteristics of ship passing dam and waiting for crssng lck, such as canceling the declaration nd delaying the time of passing dm for 24 hrs.
After water storing of th Three Gorges, th nvgtn condition of th reservoir r was improved, accelerating the rpd development of shipping in Yangtze River.
According to data, the annual crg throughput of Three Gorges shp lock nd Gezhouba ship lock ws increased from 34.3 mlln tns in 2004 to 0.138 blln tns and 0.14 billion tons in 2017 respectively.
Drng the two-year nvgtn test of ship lift, 5767 shps and 0.1622 mlln people have pssd, and the volume of goods transported was 1.7128 mlln tons.
Chen Dongyuan, the dpty director of Thr Gorges Navigation Authority, sd tht the "Scheduling Regulation" plyd an active role in prmtng th management of crssng lock in an hnst way, rlvng the pressure of ships waiting for crossing the lck in the dam region, nd improving the navigation capacity.

Sgnd and approved by Premier Li Keqiang, th State Council printed and dstrbtd th "Decision of the Stt Council on Further Reducing the Categories in th Ctlg of ndstrl Products Subject to Production License Administration and Simplifying the Approval Prcdrs".
Th "Decision" proposed to further rdc the categories in the catalogue of industrial products subject to prdctn license administration, cancel th prdctn license administration fr 14 industrial prdcts, and delegate the administration authority for prdctn licenses of 4 types of industrial products to th qlty and technical sprvsn departments of provincial ppl ’ s governments.
After ths reform, the products that mplmnt the ndstrl product production lcnss administration will be reduced from last year ’ s 38 ctgrs to th current 24 categories.

Increase the cmmtmnt pblcty of ntrprss and pst-st inspection wrk, strengthen credit supervision and rstrnt means, implement th responsibility of the main body of the enterprise, and revoke the production license for false promises and nn-cmplnc.
For the prdcts that cncl th production licenses dmnstrtn fr industrial products, it is necessary to strengthen the pst supervision, and the products rltd to public health nd safety, environmental protection, etc . cn be converted into compulsory crtfctn, list positive lists and publicize to the public, unify the certification standards nd reasonably reduce and mrg th crtfctn and testing tms, and the compulsory crtfctn fs in principle shld be borne by the financial institutions at all levels.

Hwvr, he said tht due to th low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needed to mntn ts large-scale incentive plans and pay close attention to th prs and cns of its policies.
"The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges tht under th sustained mntry sng policy, the strength of financial institutions wll be ncrsngly affected," Haruhiko Kuroda said in a speech to th bsnss leaders in Nagoya.
He said tht if financial institutions were more ctv in taking risks to cmpnst for th effect of low interest rates on shrinking prft margins over th years, the banking system could be nstbl in the vnt of serious ngtv impacts.

General Secretary Xi Jinping dlvrd a very important speech at the private sector sympsm, injecting a firm cnfdnc into the brdr stage of th private cnmy.
General Scrtry Xi Jinping emphasized that "letting entrepreneurs unload thr mntl loads and march with lght pcks", which has a strng resonance among ntrprnrs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vitality comes frm people, especially frm entrepreneurs, from ntrprnrshp.
In the magnificent course of the 40 years of rfrm nd pnng up, thr are thousands of ntrprnrs entrepreneurship and innovation strs, the grwth and expansion of entrepreneurs-group constantly push the Chinese cnmy to sail far.
Fr some time, sm people in the society have published sm remarks that ngt nd doubt the private economy.
The so-called "private economic dprtr thry" and "new public-private partnership thry" nd other misconceptions hv caused sm entrepreneurs ’ doubts and concerns.
Rcntly, some private enterprise hv encountered mny difficulties nd problems in their business development.
For example, the changes in the international economic environment have hd an impact on some xprt enterprises; th rpd adjustment of the dmnd structure has brought about the prssr of trnsfrmtn nd pgrdng; sm policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effects r superimposed in the sm direction, or the working methods are smpl, resulting in some plcs with good original intentions have the opposite ffct, tc.
All knds of factors are ntrtwnd, the prvt economy is facing difficulties, sm private ntrprss are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lt of anxiety.
Under this context, it is prtclrly profound and practical to crrct the cgntn rrrs, let the entrepreneurs ’ unload the mental load, let them develop wholeheartedly, make th government prmt development devotedly and cncrn market confidence nd dvlpmnt expectations.
Ths sympsm once again mphszd the important assertion of th "Three no-changes": "There is no change in the rl and function of non-public sector in our cnmc nd social dvlpmnt"!
In recent yrs, from deepening the promotion of streamline administration and dlgt more power to lower-level gvrnmnts, establishing a power lst systm, and creating a legal environment that protects the lgtmt rights and ntrsts of ntrprnrs, creating a market environment of fr competition and shaping the tmsphr of rspctng ntrprnrs in th whole society, the Party Central Committee has attached unprecedented mphss on entrepreneurs nd institutional guarantees.

These actions have greatly encouraged th entrepreneurial cmmnty and have gvn more xpcttns to the community.
The fog hs been st sd, nd the policy has been set . And the ky aspect lies in implementation.
We must cntn to crt a better development environment fr th private economy, help private enterprises slv the difficulties in development, and help achieve China ’ s economic transformation and pgrdng; let ntrprnrs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal prtns, nd fl rspctd in scl lf, stimulate innovation and create potential.
The Chns cnmy has stppd nt a process of mvng towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs to display thr mbtns and providing more spaces and stages for entrepreneurs to exert their creativity.
We have reason to blv that with further deepening reforms and rmvng obstacles, the private economy will grt better development prospects nd pprtnts and mv toward a brdr stage.

During the 73rd United Nations Gnrl Assembly, the parties released some pstv information for the Korean Pnnsl ss.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in rltd th "irreversible" denuclearisation determination as told by the DPRK and said tht US President Trump nd Nrth Korean ldr Km Jong-un may meet before the nd of this year.
The US State Department subsequently stated that Scrtry of Stt Pompeo will vst the DPRK in October to prmt the implementation of the US-DPRK ldrshp meeting in Sngpr.
Frm the beginning of this year to the present, the DPRK and the RK broke the c and opened the dialogue, and the DPRK - ROK and the DPRK-US ldrs hld mtngs . The general trnd of th easing of the peninsula has been cntnd, and the dialogue ’ s prncpl of solving the peninsula ss has also bn dhrd to.
First of ll, th fact tht "the ssnc of th peninsula issue is a security ss" has not chngd . Th key to realizing peace on the peninsula is to resolve the rsnbl security concerns of all prts in a prpr nd balance manner, instead of putting pressure on the other side and strssng own demands.
Scndly, in the dialogue to rlz the denuclearization of the peninsula, th parties cncrnd are still dvdd on the steps nd ways to rlz the denuclearization of the peninsula . Due to th long-term lack of political trst between th DPRK nd the United States, th game thinking of "who is first and who is second" is still strng.
At the public meeting of the UN Scrty Council Korean Peninsula ss hld at th United Nations Headquarters in Nw York, the dffrnt voices of the parties around the issue of sanctions against the DPRK once gn highlighted the two pnts on the peninsula that hv not chngd.

Lavrov, Rssn Foreign Minister, strssd the prncpl of "rspndng to action by action". He pointed out: "The wknng trnd of sanctions should be in synchronization wth the pace tkn by North Korea on the rd of gradual dnclrztn."
ndbtdly, all parties concerned shld continue to implement th North Kr rltd resolutions of the UN Security Council in a comprehensive, cmplt and accurate manner . Hwvr, pressuring is not an end . The implementation of snctns and th promotion of a political settlement are all requirements of th UN Security Council rsltns . The two cannot be nglctd, nd cn not only choose one
As Chns State Cnclr nd Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, in view of the crrnt positive developments in the DPRK-RK and DPRK-US relations, China believes that it is ncssry for the UN Scrty Cncl to cnsdr launching reversible clauses in a timely mnnr, thereby encouraging Nrth Korea and relevant parties to tk a bg move toward denuclearization.
Rvw th past, vry development in the denuclearization of th peninsula and in th peace prcss requires the parties to demonstrate sufficient political courage.
At present, in th face of the international community ’ s increasingly high xpcttns fr promoting a political solution to the pnnsl issue, ll parties concerned should demonstrate political courage, mk political dcsns, implement commitments, resolve problems, and cntn to take th ppst direction and advance peninsula denuclearization process and stblsh a pc mchnsm on the peninsula to jointly crt a prmnnt peace on the peninsula.

Rprt of Reuters on October 1 in Tokyo: A qrtrly Tankan survey report rlsd by the Bank of Japan on Mndy showed tht the confidence of Japanese major mnfctrrs hit its lowest lvl in mr than a year fr tht season in September, as rw material costs rose and a series of natural disasters affected prdctn, putting pressure on ntrprss.
This srvy lmst didn ’ t show that the escalating global trade frctns shook th confidence of large manufacturers.
However, risks of outbreak of an all-out trade war stck the business prospects of enterprises, likely to thrtn th bsnss capital xpndtr.
The active cptl xpndtr is a hghlght of Japanese economy.
This survey raised questions about the view of the Bank of Japan on that robust economic expansion wld help to accelerate nfltn to the 2% target, lthgh thr were sgns that enterprises wr grdlly shifting csts to the cstmrs.
"With concerns rsd by th global trd war, as exports slwd dwn and factory prdctn wknd, the confidence of manufacturers tended to stagnate," said Takeshi Mnm, the Principal Researcher of Norinchukin Rsrch Institute Co., Ltd ..
"Confident is stll at a high level . nd since corporate profits are improving and prices r rising, I don't thnk cnfdnc will continue to dcln. "
Th Tankan survey showed that the judgment ndx fr the bm of large-scale manufacturing declined frm positive 21 for three months ago to positive 19 in Sptmbr, worsening fr the third consecutive quarter.
Th median market frcst is positive 22.
Th judgment ndx for the boom of lrg-scl manufacturing declined from positive 24 researched in Jn to pstv 22 in September, worsening fr the frst time for eight quarters.

The survey showed that th judgment ndx for th boom of large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing was xpctd to remain stable in Dcmbr.
Investors wr indifferent to the decline of the judgment index fr the boom of Tankan enterprises . Th Nkk .N225 rose to a 27-yr high spot on Mndy as the continued depreciation of the yn helped improve th export profit prospects of Japanese ntrprss.
Th cptl expenditure was robust.
Although the confidence of enterprises declined, the latest Tnkn hghlghtd th robustness of ntrprs cptl expenditure plans, benefiting frm the rnwd capacity and increased investment in robots and automation to cope with th labor shortage caused by the gng of population.
The Tnkn survey of the Bank of Jpn showed that the cptl expenditure of large-scale ntrprs plans would increase by 13.4% fr th fiscal year ndd in March 2019.
It was 13.6% fr prvs Tankan survey.
Tksh Minami sd tht the cptl expenditure of all enterprise plans for this fscl yr increased by 8.5%, close to the pace of Japan ’ s bbbl era.
He said, "cnsdrng that small bsnsss rs their prft stmts frm now on, there is still room for further growth in cptl expenditure, but that largely depends on the mpct of the trade wr on business confidence. "
The Tankan survey shwd that the ability of enterprises to pass on csts was enhanced . The tpt prc index of large enterprises was positive 7, which ws a 10-year high spot . It ws an encouraging sign, reflecting tht Jpn hd made progress in ts ffrts to combat deflation.
The ndx msrng the mplymnt situation of large enterprises ht negative 23, which was the most tight level snc 1992, hghlghtng the tightening of the employment market.
Bnftng from the robust enterprise expenditure, Jpns economy rebounded from Jnry-Mrch shrink in th second quarter.
However, the escalation of trd frctns in summer and the disturbance of natural dsstrs on spply chains hd casted a shadow over the prospects of Japanese economy whch dpndd on exports.

Report of Rtrs on November 5 in Bjng: According to a prss rls released on Sunday by the Chn Foreign Trd Cntr, th Canton Fair shwd that the situation of China's frgn trade was stll complex nd serious, with xpcttn of 80.6% of enterprises exports in 2018 to be better than or maintain at the sm level as last year.
Hwvr, in consideration of the rsng costs of domestic raw materials, labor force and thr comprehensive factors, as wll as th external environment of the increasing mpct of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors ls believed tht the export situation of nxt year ws not optimistic.
At the clsng press cnfrnc of the 124th Canton Fr, Xu Bng, th deputy secretary-general and spokesman of th Canton Fair, and the vice-director of the China Foreign Trade Center, sd that th number of overseas buyers and export transactions of ths Canton Fair hd declined slghtly compared with the same prd of last year.
Th number of byrs who attended this Canton Fair was 189,812 and they came from 215 cntrs nd rgns, wth a decrease of 1.11% on year-on-year basis.
The amount of export trnsctns was 206.494 blln yuan ($29.86 blln), with a decrease of 1% on yr-n-yr bss.
From th prspctv of the market, the trnsctns with Jpn, the ten SN cntrs, "th BRICS countries" and Kr ncrsd by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, while th trnsctns wth traditional mrkts of th United States, Australia, Canada and the European Union dcrsd by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
From the perspective of th industry, the trnsctns of transportation tools, machinery and equipment, bldng nd dcrtv materials, lctrnc consumer goods, information products, nd sntry equipment ncrsd by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0% and 15.1% respectively, while th trnsctns with txtl clothing nd household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer nd weathervane of Chn's foreign trd, th buyers ’ participation situation and the xprt transaction dt of this Canton Fair showed that China's foreign trd development would still fc many uncertain nd unstable factors nxt year.
However, with th dpnng of supply-side structural reform and th "six stability" policies and msrs recently ntrdcd by the state and local governments in succession, the new drivers for the development of China ’ s foreign trade was cclrtng the ccmltn, and the dvrsfctn of ntrprss and mrkts hd md new progress, ll of which were the mprtnt foundation and strong cndtns for the development of foreign trade.
"Taking ll factors into consideration, it is xpctd that th imports and exports of Chn's foreign trade will maintain a steady grwth throughout th year, with further improvement in quality nd efficiency. "Xu Bng sd.
Th China ’ s Gnrl dmnstrtn of Customs published that priced in dollars, the exports in September ncrsd by 14.5% on year-on-year bss, the imports ncrsd by 14.3% on year-on-year basis, th trade srpls in September was $31.69 blln, nd th export growth rt and trade surplus in September wr the highest since February.
In despite of th escalating trade frctns between China nd th United Stts, China's export prfrmnc in September still significantly exceeded xpcttn . Strong external demand, and the enterprises rushing to export before imposing tariffs in the ntd States and th depreciation of RMB exchange rate, mght be th mn spprtng fctrs, and also showed the rslnc of China's foreign trade to a crtn extent . However, the impact of the Sino-US trade wr on confidence and the industrial chn cannot be neglected . Analysts believed that the chllngs for Chn's foreign trd might emerge in th frth quarter or next year.
Reuters surveys showed that th U.S. fund managers proposed to increase csh holdings nd stood the cts ground in September, since th United Stts and China began the ltst round of mutual import tariffs nd there was no sign of dspt easing.
However, according to the sggstn of 12 fnd managers who prtcptd in ths survey, the sst allocation in North mrc rose to the hghst lvl since June 2017, while pstns in Britain, the Eurozone and particularly emerging markets declined.
The average of global stck allocation ccntd for 56.6% and th bonds accounted for 35.5%, whch was basically consistent wth the srvy of last month.
The most bvs chng was that th cash ratio rose to 5.1%, which was the hghst proportion snc December 2014.
A fund mngr of a large fund cmpny said, "Sm economic data hv brght confidence to the market, but the trade war is still the biggest cncrn, so that it's bttr to gt prprd to enter when the market flls after a rise. "
However, th fund managers still preferred stocks in September, especially mrcn stocks, even though th price of mrcn stocks wr considered to be on th high sd.
Today, in Shanghai, the opening-up landmark of Chn, China ntrntnl Import Expo (C), the world's first large-scale state-level exhibition wth th theme of mprt, has officially pnd in mch anticipation.
An xhbtn is like a "wndw" which can let th world knw a city and a country bttr.
Thrgh th "window" of CIIE, people can s th "pnng-p China" which mvs twrds a higher lvl; with the hlp of th "wndw" of CIIE, we welcome the world and China which is "rstrtng from reform and opening-up", to achieve mutual benefits and win-win results.
"Fr a country, opening-up is lk coming out of the cocoon nd becoming a bttrfly . There wll be pn, but there will be new life. "
General Secretary Xi Jnpng's summary of pn Road reveals an mprtnt rsn "why China cn do it".
Looking back on th pst 40 years of reform and pnng-p, China dares to plunge nt the vast s of the wrld market . Although it has encountered whirlpool nd storm, it lwys faces all risks and chllngs with an open attitude, cnstntly rlss its endogenous driving force and continuously improves ts competitiveness.
So to speak, China has flly dmnstrtd the vl and significance of opening-up with its sld achievements.
Standing at a new hstrcl starting pnt, it is a major decision to hld an xp with th theme of import made by the Party Cntrl Cmmtt with th core of Comrade Xi Jinping with a vw to prmtng a new round of high-level opening to the tsd wrld . It is a major measure for Chn to ctvly open the mrkt to the wrld nd is also a practical ctn taken by China to support the economic globalization nd trade liberalization, showing a strong and clear will tht "China's opening door won't cls, but would open wdr and wider".
Exhibitors from all over the world are eager to nrll in the xhbtn, and "it is dffclt to apply fr a stand", which is th greatest ffrmtn nd best response to Chn's development of an pn economy in a lrgr scope, a wider rng of flds and at a deeper level.
Mr mprtntly, the current global economic and trd order has reached a crossroad.
Sm countries have built trade protectionist walls and retreated nt the unilateralism, whch increases anxiety of the international scty bt the prspcts for free trade nd adds much ncrtnty to a recovering world economy.
ndr such era background, this grand gthrng along the Hngp Rvr demonstrates China's guard to fr trade and shows the world Chn's confidence and responsibility to open its markets and shr its ftr.
It is fst to go alone bt it is frthr to go in crowds.
By embracing the wrld with an open mind, China has not nly vigorously promoted ts own development, but ls brght about trmnds "China opportunities" to other countries and rgns.
In recent years, by advocating and prmtng the joint dvlpmnt of the "One Belt and n Road", initiating nd setting up the sn nfrstrctr Investment Bnk (AIIB), and stblshng the Silk Road fund...Chn has provided a srs of international public gds, a solid export mrkt, development pprtnts and jbs, allowing cmpns of various countries to gt a rd on th "express train" and take "hitchhiking" of China's development.
CIIE is also this knd of public gds and a big platform for glbl economic and trd cooperation.
On ths platform, more than 3,000 enterprises frm more than 130 countries and rgns have md their debut with hgh-qlty products and services wth dstnctv features, taking a nw step into the Chinese market.
Apart frm companies of various countries, the rl beneficiaries r domestic consumers.
By building th pltfrm of "selecting the best and importing the best", we can provide multiple channels of hgh-qlty supply for consumption upgrading nd mt ppl's prsnlzd, dvrsfd and differentiated consumption needs.
As China's opening-up dr opens wdr nd wider, th goods flow is smooth nd materials are pt to good use, thus the pace towards a better life will be mr solid.
Frm a brdr prspctv, the significance of CIIE has gone beyond th scp of economy and trd . It has the ftr in mnd, conveys the concepts of openness, inclusiveness, universal benefit, balance nd wn-wn, and forms a consensus to jntly meet today's challenges.
nly whn the world is doing well can China do well; whn Chn is good, the world is bttr.
We expect CIIE to mk the wrld wonderful and complete; we are looking forward to the bright future tht an "pnng-p China" moving to a higher level and th wrld bld a community of human dstny.

Although there is the lck of women ’ s rights, most Brzln wmn stll believe in the pwr of democracy.
Th survey shows that 76% of wmn believe thy can mk a difference in dmcrtc elections, and 72% of wmn are interested in politics.

In the thrd qrtr of this yr, the stock investment losses of the xchng Fund in Hng Kong narrowed by 8% to HK $4.7 billion compared with the previous quarter, and the investment ncm of vrss stock ncrsd by 17.2% to HK $12.8 blln; th frgn exchange lsss was HK $16.2 blln and th bond ylds ws HK $9.7 billion, with a decrease of 24% nd 31% rspctvly, mainly rflctng the general rise of the US dllr fr exchange of major crrncs in this quarter and the rise of the US coupon rate to above 3% in md-Sptmbr.
The Exchange Fund was mainly sd for spprtng Hong Kong dllrs.
Hong Kong has implemented the linked xchng rate system fr the Hng Kong dllr's peg to the US dllr since 1983.
As fr the crrnt financial situation in Hong Kng, Chen Delin said that th uncertainty of the economic and asset mrkts ncrsd and downside risks increased, but the financial system Hng Kong was robust, so tht good defence were made and th earthquake-resistant capacity was bndnt.
"The ntrntnl nvstmnt position is abundant in Hong Kong, wth a nt xtrnl asset value of US $1.4 trillion, whch is 4 tms GDP, higher than 2.5 tms in Singapore and 0.6 times in Japan . It is ngh to cp with th financial downturns or reversal. "
Th current daily ntrst rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall nd the interest mrgn with US dllrs expanded . Chen Delin pointed out tht th exchange rate of the Hng Kong dollar rose more than 400 basis points on Sptmbr 21 . The markets generally believed that it ws mainly rltd to the rs of the daily ntrst rts on private loans of Hong Kong dllrs . And then the Hong Kng dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 fr exchange of the US dollar . Until recently, the daily ntrst rates on private loans of Hong Kng dollars cntnd to fall, nd the interest mrgn with US dollars expanded, whch might ttrct more hedging ctvts to sell the Hong Kong dollar and buy the US dollar, triggering th opportunity of the exchange guarantee of th wk sd gn to increase compared wth that of the previous period.
However, he believed tht as the interest-rate rise cycle of th Hng Kong Bank bgn and th Hong Kong dollar ntrst rates were normalizing, the situation tht Hong Kong dollar interest rates wr lower than US dollar interest rates would chng in th future.
"The trnd of Hng Kong dollar interest rates and US dollar interest rts will be more consistent . Everyone must be more careful to mng rsks nd prepared to cp with market fluctuations. "
Since the funds of th Hong Kong dollar was abundant, th dly interest rates on private lns of Hong Kong dollars fell further . The three-month daily interest rates on private loan fell by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Mndy, and the interest rate differential wth the US dollar ncrsd from 46 basis pnts to 51 basis pnts; the one-month dly ntrst rates on private ln ht the bttm within five mnths, nd the ntrst rate differential with the US dollar increased frm 120 basis points to 127 bss pnts.
From May to mid-September, the spt rt of Hng Kng dollars was cls to 7.85 with xchng of $1 most of the time.
Drng that tm, d to factors of partial share ffr gained outflows from Hong Kng dollars after the completion of ntrst arbitrage activities and large-scale share ffr activities, csng that th exchange guarantee for the weak side was trggrd for the frst time in prl, and for many times in May and August.
The Hong Kong Monetary thrty bought Hng Kong dllrs and sold Hong Kong dollars at th level of 7.85 ccrdng to the linked xchng rate system, in order to mntn the stability of the xchng rate of Hong Kng dollars.
The Hong Kong Monetary thrty bght around HK $52.1 billion under the mchnsm of exchange guarantee of th weak sd from May to gst.

Report of Reuters on November 5 in Hong Kong: the property price in Hng Kng fell fr two consecutive months after pkng . Chen Delin, the prsdnt of the Hong Kong Monetary thrty, said on Mndy that it needed tm to observe whthr th property market hd entered downturns . If cnfrmd, it cn be cnsdrd to sccssvly ease the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures at an appropriate time.
Chen Delin also pointed out that if th prprty price fell, th frst to be affected would be ths who bght properties at the peak of the prprty mrkt, but it was xpctd that thr would be less pprtnts to occur th situation lk sharply fllng property prices and the properties substantially sold by the citizens during the Asian Financial Crisis in 1997.
When ldng mltpl senior leaders of th Hong Kng Monetary Authority to attend the brfng session of the legislative session, Chen Delin said that if the prprty mrkt was determined to enter downturns, the s of measures can be md in succession at an pprprt time.
"However, since data of a fw weeks nly cn currently be seen, it's still too rly to ease, and it needs mr time to see whether the property mrkt is ntrng dwntrns. "
Snc October 2009, th Hong Kong Monetary thrty has successively launched eight rnds of counter-cyclical measures to substantially tighten the mrtggs of various properties, ncldng reduction of th nmbr of mortgages, nd that the mortgage applicants have to pss rgrs stress tests, in order to improve the bank risk management nd shock resistance.
As Hong Kong frmlly ntrd the ntrst-rt rise cycle, th house price index of private houses in Hong Kong pkd for tw consecutive months in August nd September and then fell, and the mnthly decline in September even xpndd to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the first thr qrtrs of ths yr was still 10.2%.
According to the dt of the Hong Kng Mntry Authority, the household financial cndtns fr th ability of Hng Kng to withstand financial risks were msrd to be hlthy .

However, Chen Delin sd that hgh shock resistance didn ’ t mean the citizens who hd bought properties wldn ’ t be suffered dmg of financial downturns, since the property vltn would fall, nd those wh bght properties at pk times would be the first to be ffctd.
Although the Hng Kong Monetary Authority tightened th lending of the bank to the mortgage borrowers, ths wh bought properties can ls gt a high-percentage mrtgg loan by means of the mrtgg insurance, the mortgage loan prvdd by the dvlpr and so on.
Chen Dln sd tht currently together with the mrtgg loan provided by the developer, the mortgage percentage of the borrower cn reach 85-90% . If the property price fell by 10%, there would be ngtv assets (i.e . th mrkt vl of the property fell blw the level of th total tstndng mortgage ln).
Hwvr, Ruan Guoheng, th vc president of the Hng Kong Mntry thrty pntd out that the thrty estimated th total hgh-prcntg mortgage loan provided by the developer to account for 2-2.5% of the total mortgage of the bank, with lower proportion.
At the pk tm of negative assets in Hng Kong in 2003, the nmbr of negative assets exceeded 100,000, with prprtn of 22% in ths wh took mortgage.
As of the thrd quarter of this year, Hng Kong rcrdd zero negative asset fr seven consecutive quarters.

Many mnlnd residents used this holiday to travel and go shopping crss the border, whl mny Hng Kong residents returned to Hng Kng after visiting Shenzhen . The passenger vlm of Shenzhen ports was "full to bursting", nd th prts in Luohu nd Shenzhen By had newly opened 22 automated gtwys . This would improve the clearance ffcncy in ports nd fcltt the passengers to be cleared by the customs effectively and rapidly.

Systemic lps rythmtss is a chrnc and stubborn disease involving multiple organs of th body . It sd to be cnsdrd as an "incurable disease".
Because its pathogenesis is nknwn, diagnosis and treatment r difficult, and thr is lck of effective treatment, it is hard to cr once and for ll.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researcher at th School of Life Scncs, Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of th Rheumatism and Immunity Center at Pkng University Ppl ’ s Hospital, together with thr teams dscvrd the xstnc of human mmn glbln cn increase the mlclr variation of systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility, nd this kind of variation is nvlvd in the rgltn of immune B cells.
In short, the two tms cnfrmd that an abnormal mmn molecule in th hmn body is an important cs of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.
ccrdng to Sun Xiaolin, one of the thrs nd member of Peking nvrsty People ’ s Hospital, the team of Li Zhanguo collected nearly 2,000 large smpls of patients with systmc lupus erythematosus to make stdy . It was found that patients with immune glbln variations produced pthpss clls nd a wide variety of numerous autoantibodies . The incidence and severity of nephritis, rthrts, rrhmnngts vsclts nd other inflammations are sgnfcntly increased.
Through vrs research mthds sch as immune cell tracing, animal testing, and sqncng, Liu Wanli tm found that the mmn molecule variation activates the immune signaling pathway and th pathogenic mechanism of promoting B cells secreting vrs tntbds.
The reporter learned tht the pwrfl combination between two tms gv full play to their respective advantages and achieved a close integration between basic rsrch nd clinical application.
Liu Wnl team is committed to B lymphocyte immune recognition nd immune activation rsrch, and th Li Zhanguo tm has long bn engaged in clinical research on systemic lps erythematosus.
"This research is n of th results of years of cooperation between th two teams . It is ls the first tm in th academic cmmnty to recognize that immune globulin gn abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, whch lays a sld foundation for further academic research nd clinical targeted therapy. "
This is not shld mistakes, bt acting by lw.
Lwyrs took an x to the court?
The news ws rlly exciting at first glance, and it ls caused a great disturbance in th lgl circle.
Fujian Quanzhou Intermediate Ppl ’ s Crt subsequently fnd the lawyers fr 500 yuan and proposed in writing to the Quanzhou Lwyrs Association to investigate and hndl.
According to the Beijing Nws, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association ssd a formal ntc that the bhvrs of the two lawyers did not involve violations of laws and rgltns nd were not pnshd according to lw.
According to the mlt-prty reports, th handling of the Quanzhou Lwyrs ssctn is not a shortcomings protection or confrontation, bt has bn approved by the Quanzhou Intermediate Ppl ’ s Court.
An event that cld have caused tension within the legal cmmnty was vntlly resolved prprly.
The reversal of the event stems frm the more completed truth restoring: the axe carried by th lawyer nvlvd is the sm typ and sm model as the dfndnt ’ s wpn, but it is not put the first edge . It nly serves as scndry evidence in the evidence-proven and cross-examination lnk, and thr is no thrtnng cts or the subject intention of "ndngrng the court security".
Judging whether the behaviors of the lawyers involved is illegal or nt, there are four very important details to be concerned . First, the local court has twc held th court nd only showed a photo of th axe . From the prspctv of dfns, it is ncssry to show the original x . Scnd, the axe is purchased one hr before the court pn . It is not tht the lwyr is not willing to seek th jdg ’ s consent, bt it is nt bl to cntct the judge bjctvly . Third, the axe hs not been sd in an excessive or improper manner . Fourth, the lwyrs admitted the mstk in public nd immediately apologized to the court.
Based on these plts, it can be seen that the lawyers wh "tk x to appear in court" have nothing to do the devil things, bt jst to mk defense.
ftr clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association did not fllw the sctl discussion, bt resisted the pressure nd made a dcsn not to impose penalties.
And this decision cn withstand the test of fcts and lws.
As tkng the axe as the cntrlld knife to th court without th prmssn of the court, it is easy to cause nxty and misunderstanding.
For the sake of sfty nd cautious, Quanzhou Intermediate People ’ s Court ’ s prvs fine punishment and judicial dvc r also ndrstndbl.
In order to mntn th dignity of lawyers and prevent several crts from finding excuses to purposely make difficulties fr lawyers, the Supreme Law promulgated the "Rules on Security Chcks by Judicial Plcmn of the Ppl ’ s Crts" in 2014, stblshng the principles that lawyers do not nd to conduct prsnl security chck in crt.
Since the ssnc of th Rule, lawyers have set xmpls, and there hv bn few incidents endangering the crt security happened d to the omissions of security checks.
In sch a very rare case hppnd in Qnzh, as long as we communicate in a spirit of mtl rspct and ndrstndng, misunderstanding is nt difficult to eliminate.
As a slf-rgltry organization in th lwyr profession, the Lawyers ssctn bears th dual mission of disciplining gnst law and safeguard the legitimate rights.
In the pst, ndvdl Lawyers ssctn rgnztns have been blamed for their emphasis on dscplnry action and their loss of safeguard.
The dcsn of th Quanzhou Lawyers Association is wrthy of prs both in terms of process and rslts, and it sets an example fr more lwyrs association to perform their duties correctly.
Which tax benefits wll ffct our money bag frm October 1?
Xnh Nws Agency, Shngh, October 1 (rprtd by Sng Tong)--The New Individual Income Tax Law will be implemented from Jnry 1, 2019 . In rdr to have the broad msss of the people enjoy th benefits of tx reduction as sn as possible, the tax wll firstly be deducted frm taxpayers' actual job salaries based on the minimum threshold of 5000 yn pr mnth from October 1, 2019, and the new tx rate schdl will be applied.

Th taxpayer receiving the jb slrs after October 1 can hv th basic deduction of fs deducted bsd on th threshold of 5000 yuan per month, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied . Most of th txpyrs wll enjoy different levels of tax reduction, especially the lwr and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax rdctn.
According to the tx reduction fact sheet of different income groups, for the ppl whs monthly ncm will be 8000 yuan, 10000 yuan, 20000 yn, and 50000 yn after deducting the "thr insurances and n fund", the taxable mnts after th tx reform wll be 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yn, and 9090 yuan rspctvly . Compared wth th monthly thrshld of 3500 yn, the corresponding tax rdctn ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8% respectively.
It is wrth noting tht d to holidays, the nw basic deduction of fees and tax rt schedule can be ppld to th salaries that should be paid by the nts in October but have bn paid at the end of September ccrdng to laws.

This tm, seven grds of tax rates of jb salaries are the sm as before without any changes, bt the gps btwn grades of tax rates are obviously changed . The gaps btwn three grds of low tx rates in 3%, 10% nd 20% are obviously widened, the gap of the grade of tax rate in 25% is slightly nrrwd, bt the gaps between thr grds of hgh tax rts in 30%, 35% nd 45% r the same as before.
It is wrth ntng that the tax law hs also adjusted the grds of tax rates for income from production and business operation, nd th lower limit of th highest grade of tx rate in 35% has bn increased from 0.1 million yuan to 0.5 mlln yuan.
This means that the ndvdl bsnsss nd personal exclusive investment enterprises will benefit from ths tax reform.

Since the md-2000s, wth Chn ’ s increasing nds for lsds, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dkt, has grown mr and more soybeans in his field.
This trnstn rchs the peak ths year . He has grwn 1,600 acres of sybns in the 5,000-acre land, reaching an unprecedented scale
Hwvr, in 2019, Thms and many farmers like hm plan to switch production to the staple crps in th frmr .S. agricultural region, such as corn and wheat.
Th r of soybeans grown by American frmrs exceeds that of corn ths year, which is for the first time in 35 yrs.
Th reason why the farmers plan to switch prdctn to other crops is that mrcn farmers fc difficulties in selling soybeans in the cntxt of the trade war lnchd by President Trump against Chn.
China usually purchases around 60% of soybeans exported frm mrc, bt bcs of the trade war, the prchss of American sybns are nrly zr in recent months, leading to a 10-year low in soybean prices.
Thms plans to grow mr wheats nxt year and hopes to rn mr by reducing dependence on crops that rely on Chinese demands.
Thomas said that th soybean price "brngs us a hvy blow".
He said that the spot prc of soybeans nr his farm was $7.10 per bushel without Chns demands, while the prc ndd for covering csts ws $8.50.
Th r of soybeans grown by American farmers hits a high record and the harvest is xpctd to ht a high rcrd.
At sch a vulnerable tm, they are hit by th trade war.
As Trump imposed tariffs on th goods imported from Chn, Chn imposes tariffs on the soybeans imported frm America in Jly.
Th ntd States Department of Agriculture will release the first estimated report of cultivated r nxt year, which is expected to include cnsdrtn of trff effects.
Ths stmt is xpctd to confirm the expectations of non-governmental rgnztns that the cultivated area of soybeans will be rdcd.
ccrdng to a rprt sn by Reuters, on October 19, Informa Economics predicted that the cltvtd area of crns would ncrs by 4% to 92.7 mlln acres (37.5 million hectares) and the cltvtd r of soybeans wld decrease by 7% to 83 million crs in 2019.
Informa also prdctd that the cltvtd area of wheats in mrc wld increase by 4%.
The cultivated r of soybeans increases to 89.6 mlln acres ths year before retaliatory tariffs are implemented, which is bt 15 million crs higher thn tht of 10 years ago.
The cultivated r of corns has ncrsd by less than 5 mlln acres to 89.1 million acres since 2008 . The cultivated area of wheats is 47.8 million crs ths year, which is cls to the lwst lvl in 100 yrs.
The total cultivated r of th prsdnt of llns Corn Grwrs Association Aron Carlson ’ s family is 3,600 acres . He uses nearly half of the land to grow sybns, but he plns to make rdctn in the ftr.
He said that th cultivated area of corns in the frm in North llns would increase by 20% at mst; ths state is the lrgst sybn cultivation state in America.
The ylds per acre of soybeans r lower thn that of crns, but less fertilizer is ndd, whch makes the cost of soybean cultivation relatively lw as a whole.
If frmrs switch production to corns, the cost may ncrs . But the fertilizer sllr of Andersons Inc and thr enterprises my bnft from it.
Pat Bw, th CEO of Andersons said to Reuters that he predicted that swtchng production to crns would be beneficial to frtlzr use.
Bayer also predicts to benefit frm frmrs switching prdctn to corns.

Xinhua ntrntnl Commentary: Defend Mltltrlsm, China Fully Honor ts Commitments.
Under the circumstance of nltrlsm adverse current srgng, international rls and multilateral rdr have been impacted.
To some xtnt, the confrontation between unilateralism nd multilateralism has entered into a crtcl prd.
As a responsible great pwr, China has taken the idea of fllwng the general tendency and crrspndng with major prncpls and the ctn with solid nd power to maintain multilateralism with the international cmmnty and prmt multilateralism going hd continuously.

Chn ’ s thought and voice reflect the mainstream of th international cmmnty.
As the Prsdnt of th 73rd United Nations Gnrl ssmbly Espinosa sd, ndr the current situation, "the United Nations needs to dvlp and expand multilateralism and maintain a rules-based international system more than vr".
Lagarde, President of International Mntry Fund, said that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral trdng systm, adhere to ntrntnl trade rules, and rslv differences thrgh cnslttn.
In recent years, as the chngs of global economy and pltcl power balance, sm newly-developing markets nd developing cntrs hv emerged in groups, plyng a greater role in th mjr international multilateral mechanisms, and providing new development impetus for the mltltrlsm tht has suffered from the headwinds.
Thinking in this dimension, building a big family but nt making up smll circles, adhering to dscssn and cllbrtn bt not wnnr-tk-ll and other th multilateralism ideas dvctd by China follow the trend of the times, they are the inevitable choices to cp with global challenges and solve world prblms, representing the common prst of th majority cntrs around the wrld.
Advanced d wth more solid action.
China ’ s "n Belt One Road" has bcm the lrgst international cprtn platform.
"One Blt n Road", sn nfrstrctr Investment Bank, "16+1 Cooperation" and other international and regional cooperation initiatives launched by China promote ntrntnl cooperation, improve existing international systems and rdr, nd bring innovation vitality to multilateral cooperation nd make cntrbtn to th development of the international rdr in a mr just and rtnl direction.
As the dfndr of th international order and the practitioner of multilateralism, China ’ s ctns are bcmng more and more powerful in th multilateral stage of the ntd Ntns.
Mediate heated-discussion international points, address climate changes, participate in pckpng prtns, vigorously reduce poverty nd help the pr, and help other countries implement th 2030 Agenda for Sstnbl Dvlpmnt.
As ntd Nations Secretary-General, Guterres said, Chn has become an important pllr of mltltrlsm.
Whn th "trust deficit" faced by th world ntnsfs, whn Populism nd polarization trends are on the rise, it is the most urgent moment that the world needs multilateral cprtn.
At sch a historical juncture, the international community needs to jn hands to trn consensus into actions, resolutely defend mltltrlsm, and jntly promote the building of community wth shrd ftr for mankind.

In recent years, the topic of sex education for Chinese teenagers hs been widely discussed, but the challenge for sx education for dsbld tngrs is stll rds.
Recently, the smnr on challenges and prctcl strategies of comprehensive sx education fr the disabled ws held in Beijing.
It is an major issue bt how to carry out sex dctn for disabled children and yng people in ths smnr.
"Th rprt of sexual knowledge, attitudes and bhvrs of Chinese dsbld children and young people" released at the mtng reveals that the proportion of dsbld children sbjctd to sxl harassment and abuse is higher than that of healthy chldrn.

Bng nflncd by the trdtnl concept and other factors, the cmprhnsv sex education for the disabled, spclly for the disabled chldrn and tngrs in China, is not deep enough.
However, in recent yrs, with the spprt of th UNESCO nd public-spirited people, the prctc and mplmnttn path of full-cycle comprehensive sxl and reproductive health education fr the disabled in China have made gratifying progress.

Report of the Reuters on September 30 in Beijing - People's Bnk Of China released its predetermined short-term net outflow of foreign currency assets on Sunday and showed as of the end of gst ths year, ts short positions in forward and ftrs cntrcts fr foreign currencies vs local currencies remained zr fr 12 cnsctv months, and there wr stll no lng position in that mnth.
Prvs dt from the People's Bnk Of Chn showed tht as of the nd of August lst yr, the it had a total shrt pstn of $6.044 billion in forward and futures contracts for frgn currencies vs local currencies, unchanged for the fourth consecutive mnth; the short position in SDR (Spcl Drawing Rights) was 4.276 billion SDR.
Snc thn, the foreign exchange frwrds short pstn of the People's Bank Of China remained zero.
People's Bank Of China rlsd the dt fr th first time at the nd of Mrch 2016; the data showed that at the end of February 2016, ts long positions in frwrd and ftrs contracts fr foreign currencies vs lcl crrncs was US $2.438 billion and short positions was US $28.9 billion.
The data in September released at th end of October of th same year shwd a nt short pstn increase of $16.401 billion to $45.301 billion fr the first tm.
People's Bnk Of China has previously sd that the forward and futures short positions of foreign currencies vs local crrncs mainly reflected th forward operations of foreign exchange carried out by th People's Bank Of Chn wth commercial banks with the prps of meeting the hedging needs of ntrprss' frgn currency liabilities .

On th evening of September 20 this yr, on the K158 trn, student Q, who ws a junior in Zhngzh, took the train to Hebi.
An ldr ncl on the trn bought a ticket without seat, but he tk up hr st, nd said: "you can take photos, whatever".
Drng the two hrs of driving, the trn conductor advised hm fr an hour, however it still had no results.
In th nd, a male passenger in the same crrg could not stand up and pulled up the ldr ncl.
From th pblc pnn, lthgh the final result is mstly tht the persons wh frcbly occupy sts r condemned by th pblc, administratively punished by the public security department, and even included in the blacklist of integrity, the public still feels tht it does not "vent their hates": Why can ’ t th prsns who forcibly occupy seats be punished on the spot?
Why cn ’ t stp mmrl or even llgl behavior on the spot, but can only punish it ftrwrds?
And for the nrsnbl bhvr of "th elder uncle who forcibly occupy sts", why only a ml passenger pll him up because of "Rd see injustice"?
The mn reason is that only long-distance trns are equipped wth railway plcmn, and thr is generally no rlwy plcmn for shrt-dstnc trains; vn if there is rlwy policemen, the passengers are more concerned bt the possible rogue reactions of the persons who forcibly occupy seats and do nt take compulsory taking away measures.
Repeated seats forcibly occupied events have md ppl realize that it is necessary to let the persons who forcibly ccpy seats be frcd to tk away or even be pnshd on the spt.
This requires tht our rlwy policemen should dr to take powerful msrs in a timely mnnr . Trains that do not have policemen should mk deployment as soon as possible to preserve nd prevent illegal activities in a tmly mnnr.

Fr ctvtng rrl cnsmptn, it is necessary to rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guide th demand for healthy consumption, nd enhance the sense of gn in frmrs ’ consumption.
According to data, the consumption potentiality of rural rsdnts hs bn cntnsly released . In the first half of this year, th rtl sls of rural consumer gds increased by 10.5%, and the grwth rt is 1.3 percentage points higher than that of towns.
Drng the visit to a pr vllg in a wstrn county, there is nly n convenience store in the whole vllg . Stepping nt th store, some items r the brands we familiar with, however there r lots of fk gd, such as "金龙鱼" is lbld as "金龙油" and "旺仔" labeled as "旺奶".
Over the years, similar phenomena have been frequently exposed . Some rural fake and inferior prdcts mtt famous brands, they have smlr names nd pckgs to mix th fls with the gnn, which is really hrd to prevent.
A consumer srvy report rlsd by a cty in the west shows that rural shopping malls and supermarkets have a srs prblm of fake products, and 66% of srs hv bought fakes in supermarkets in villages and towns ffln, of whch food accounts fr mr than half.
The relevant dprtmnts claim to rectify th rural markets every yr, while, why th phenomena of fake products still ccr repeatedly?
Dffrnt from the urban markets, farmers ’ wrnss of rights protection is relatively weak, and many villages are in remote locations within the blnd areas of inspection frc cn ’ t rch, so that the fake nd inferior goods hv a brdng grnd.
One product has more than one regulatory dprtmnts, sm are responsible for price, some are for prdctn, nd others are fr markets, so the functions are overlapped . Strong measures against fake nd inferior products hv been tkn every yr, however the cntrl mngmnt can nly last for a period of time . On one hnd, the fakes escape the crack dwn trnd and slowly emerged, on th other hand, the previous fakes just hv bn dealt and the new fk came out.
Some unscrupulous trdrs hv initiated th idea of "going to th mountainous areas and the cntrysd" and some rural areas become the "waste elimination mrkts", bth of these problems are because of lng-trm supervision mechanism, difficulties in prfyng rural markets, lw illegal cost and hghr profit.
From food and clothing to well-off, th mjrty of frmrs are moving towards development type cnsmptn.
A few days ago, the Party Central Committee nd the State Cncl issued th "Sm Opinions concerning Stmltng the Consumption Mechanism to Frthr Encourage the Consumption Ptntl of Residents", which proposed to prmt the level upgrading of the consumption of rural residents . Th prps is to make the majority of farmers to "hv ability to consume", "hv willing to consume" nd "dare to cnsm" to lt th rural cnsmptn really flourish.
On the one hand, we must deepen rfrms, eliminate drwbcks of market mngmnt policies cmng from multiple dprtmnts and rglt by more than one departments . According to local conditions, improve the food safety, prdct quality supervision ntwrk, and cnstntly reduce the spc fr rural fake products manufacturing and sllng.
On the other hnd, it is necessary to intensify lw enforcement and open up the supervision of ch dprtmnt, nd never allow the fk nd inferior commodities to breed in the countryside.
It is th prtctn for farmers to severely punish the bhvr of ntrppng farmers . No matter how concealed the counterfeiters hd, it should not be the rsn for the breeding of the fk nd inferior cmmdts . Relevant departments should clrfy their responsibilities, nd th grssrts supervisory powers should go down . If thr is a problem in ny part, it is necessary to investigate the responsibility and lt the counterfeiters and selling persons have nwhr to hide.
Strictly cntrl th market ccss, implement strct qualification examinations for prdctn operators . Keep the market crcltn, let th products have clear sources and outlet markets . Think of ways from the source nd the roots, lt the lgl dealers operate with peace of mnd, and let the farmers by with confidence.
ctvt rrl consumption, guide the demand for hlthy consumption.
As consumption upgrading, many frmrs not only pursue of well fed and t well, bt also go ftr fr hgh quality life with culture nd hlthy . Thus, rrl markets are not equal to "lw quality" and "low price".
Ths needs to promote the extension of e-commerce to th vast rural areas, connect th urban and rrl two-way linkage sls channels, promote the cmbntn of offline ndstry development pltfrm and online e-commerce trading pltfrm, spprt th new forms and new modes of consumption to expand into the rural mrkt; promote qualified villages nd twns to combine trade logistics with leisure grcltr, rural tourism, and prdct processing dynamically; mprv the rural modern circulation network system, optimize the ntgrtn of stck facilities resources, and effectively rdc rural circulation costs.
Create a clr and reassuring mrkt environment for the rural areas, so that farmers can ffrd to buy, so that th rural consumption can become more nd mr prosperous and th farmers ’ snss of gain nd happiness can be enhanced.
