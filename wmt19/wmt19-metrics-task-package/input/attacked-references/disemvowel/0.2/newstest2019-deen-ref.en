The prsdnt of DFB Grindel sees no bss for th returning of Özil
Berlin - The president of DFB Reinhard Grndl sees no basis for th rtrnng of Mesut Özl to the national tm.
There is an open question so you gt into a conversation, you talk to hm bt why you have pprntly felt tht wy, how is sttd in his sttmnt, said Grndl in football Podcast "Phrasenmäher" of the nwsppr "Bild-Zeitung".
In spite of th debate going on for months bt the photos of Özil with th Trksh Prsdnt Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets th return of the 92-match national plyr Özil.
I would be happy if Mst Özl continued to play for Grmny.
At some point of time I ls assumed that it wll hppn, said Grndl.
The 29-year-old hd declared tht he quits DFB team in July and explained it with the fact that Grindel dd not prtct hm against racist hostility drng th World Cup.
The DFB hd repeated hs criticism of Özl and that he is nt ready for a discussion with ntnl coach and tm manager Oliver Bierhoff.
He did nt want to create ny pressure, but he knows that in football ‘ if you leave a team or chng clb, you talk to yr trnr nd I think it is sad tht this discussion did nt happen before ’.

Audi: "Dieselgate" rgnrtn tks longer than planned
There is still a diesel tskfrc, said Peter Mrtns, chief development officer from th ‘ tmblwch ’ trade jrnl.
In Dcmbr 2017 the imprisoned nd suspended Audi C Rupert Stadler hd announced, the taskforce will be dsslvd soon.

The taskforce ws set up in September 2015 following th dscvry at d parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens highlighted that th automobile manufacturers had made ‘ srs, rgnztnl changes ’, to prevent sch a scandal vr happening again.
Th VW Sprvsry Brd had postponed a dcsn on Stadler's future on Frdy and will continue this discussion on Tuesday.
Th investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss, fllwng awareness of xhst emission chtng, of permitting the sale of diesel automobiles wth false mssn values.

Grindel seeking r-lctn - Lahm to jn the Prsdntl Brd of the German football association (DFB)
Mnz (dp) - Despite the crtcsm directed at him personally following the rly FF World Cup exit and the scandal around Mesut Özil, Reinhard Grindel wnts to run for ffc as President of the DFB gn in the cmng year.
I do my wrk and try to make it as gd as it gts, sd Grndl as a gst rly Sunday mrnng on ZDF ’ s weekly sports broadcast "Das aktuelle Sportstudio".
A re-election should be ttmptd nd tht is what I will do.
nd then you have to s wht kind of support you get.
In hs own words, th head of the association would find it "strng" if he did not "feel like working on th future project" after Grmny was wrdd th UEFA rpn Football Championship 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been th hd of th association as successor to Wolfgang Niersbach, who had to resign mdst the scndls surrounding the 2006 FIFA Wrld Cup in Grmny.
In autumn 2016 he ws elected fr a frst full term of three years.
Th nxt vote wll be held at the DFB ’ s national cnfrnc on September 27, 2019.
According to Grindel, the ftr head rgnzr of th 2024 European Football Championship in Grmny, Philipp Lahm, is to join th DFB Presidential Brd.
I would be pleased if my colleagues on the presidential board agreed tht he wll continue to provide advice on th board in this rl and then of crs we vry mch invite him to shr his experience in sporting matters, said Grndl.
At the sm time, he dd nt want to speculate as to whether or not Lhm cld sccd him as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of the scandal over the photos tkn by Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündgn wth the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel xprssd a prfrnc fr a national tm player without an immigration background to fill th position of DFB ambassador fr ntgrtn.
Currently, this position is flld by native Brzln Cacau and Celia Ssc, who traces her fmly bck to Cameroon.
If somebody wtht a migration bckgrnd is an obvious influencer in scty and football and says, ‘ th issue is an important n, we nd to do something bt it ’, ‘ this would ls be an initiative to prvd a better fndtn fr our local teams, whr integration needs to wrk ’, Grindel said.

Treysa has struggled gnst vandalism nd garbage
Accessing the 36-klmtr cycle track in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is vry dffclt nd heavily littered.
Attempts are made to rmdy th rampant vandalism, but thr are hardly ny signs of solutions.
Shrds, cgrtt butts, garbage and rubbish, demolished rubbish bins and now dismantled sgns - so for quite some tm prsnts itself th entrance with seating r to the bk path on the Haaße-hill in Treysa.
Th sight of th bicycle path, whch is the flgshp object in Rotkäpchenland, is more than inglorious.
Th matter is of cncrn to th ADFC (Grmn Cyclists Association) chptr Schwalmstadt, but others have also tkn interest fr some time, according to the city's cycling commissioner lrch Wüstenhagen.
Th problem has already bn addressed by the bcycl traffic advisory body.
Thr is no solution so fr.
Sggstns rngd from transferring the seating area to the regular emptying of garbage cans, and cleaning th pnt of entry rs.
I thnk, the lttr wld be the order of the day, rrspctv of ny further activities, says Wüstenhagen.
Gd Hhn (DFC) says he also brought the issue up wth the local advisory council.
Not only th rubbish is a nuisance fr cyclists and residents - on weekends the seating group is a regular mtng plc for prtyng.
It is not just about th noise, there are also disturbances due to parties: Psts plld t of th ground, grbg cans wrecked, signs snapped nd seating daubed.
Frequently vlntrs have already clnd up, explains the DFC member Susanne Klippert.
ctns r only proverbial drops in the ocean.
They are nnyd that the rest area at the cycl track in Treysa is a mtng point fr binge-drinking.
Clrly the fcs pnt along the entire bike path is here on the Haaße, confirms the cycling cmmssnr, who now is also responsible for th cycling site in Zgnhn, whch will be opened tdy.
If it sffrs the same fate, it wll cost drly.
Another d is placing vd surveillance on the hill: "Pssbly ths raises the threshold to engage in damaging common prprty.
However, this would rqr a plc patrol to cm out.
In principle, Wüstnhgn supports the dvlpmnt of th Haaße hill.
It nds to be md more attractive.
So fr one cn be very satisfied wth how well the bicycle path is frqntd.
It is stll possible to develop trsm-rltd marketing.
r cycle trck is of very high quality cmprd to others in German ’, grd the ADFC members.
ADFC member Susanne Klippert considers th situation in th Ascheröder Strss in Trys to be critically dangerous.
There is no turning lane on Hß Hügl.
In hvy trffc, cyclists may end up waiting in the mddl of bidirectional trffc flows", she xplns.
Tht wld not be a problem for sporty cyclists, but is fr older ppl and especially for children.
Music cntst at the culture train sttn: The "Kö vn Hltrp" and the sea
The first call to participate in th music cntst was a sccss, creative and cprtv.
Your Sng fr Hiltrup is the motto of the Hiltrup nttv fr the "Music Contest fr young and old, new and experienced mscns."
A cntst "wth a wink from th lovely Hiltrup fmly", as Karl Franke worded it.
In fact, it soon bcm a fmll togetherness wth coffee and cake from the volunteers of th Kulturbahnhof.
Seven cts prfrmd, from a one-man bnd to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pianist Marcel ntd, Henk Humberg with hs gtr, Rlf Ihmig, an old-established Hltrp mn, the "Hltrpr Sternfarben", three mmbrs from three generations of the Trnkmp nd Claus families, an ensemble from the kndrgrtn Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling und die Zwarties.
Ths contest is a nvlty, xplns district mayor Joachim Schmidt.
We have not sn smthng lk this in other districts.
What did the songwriters sng bt?
Particularly popular places were the Hiltrup lake nd Mrktll.
Rlf Ihmig dedicated the song to th avenue Marktalle in his flk-lk sng "Kö von Hiltrup".
Th Kltrbhnhf was also mentioned.
Over nd over gn, th acts sng about experiencing togetherness in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Krl Franke led the audience through the breaks with short interviews with the prfrmrs or sm nfrmtn about the rtsts.
Thus, the dnc learnt that Humberg that he had actually studied chemistry, bt now also tchs gtr.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Frnk reported that he hd recently performed in Ldwgshfn - at a major BSF event with Barclay Jms Harvest as a main ct.
And lvn Jasic hs pldd a lot of YouTube videos.
It ’ s nt about wnnng, Franke hd said.
In fact, all participants received a gift frm Hltrp ctrng businesses.
Fr the jury's fvrts there was smthng special - so that thrs could also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and hs pnst Marcel Untied cn record an entire CD with sound tchncn Schemmelmann.
thr musicians can record a song: Ihmig with hs Hiltrup ht, which especially impressed Frnk with his msclty, nd th “ Lmmrlnd pack: ” “ a very gd performance ” with ten children and two tchrs on guitar and cjón, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, th children also performed gn for the finals - and vn wtht electronic support, they sounded "really good," Frnk sd.
Th jury ws guided by the aspects of originality, rfrnc to Hiltrup, ctchnss of the melody and recognition vl.
Th jry included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klmfß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver hlrs frm the Trade Association as well as Jn Kaven, chairman of the dstrct offensive.
The district ffnsv launched the vnt on the occasion of its ten-year nnvrsry.
They considered th event a cmplt success.

The Word Game: Tstng "Dcrypt"
The plyrs form tw teams and sit opposite n another.
For each page there is a scrn, on it there r fr cards with kywrds that you can decipher - th ld trick with the red foil.
This ensures th other sd cn not read anything unintentionally.
Fr xmpl, on th cards it says to read from left to right: "1 . Rnssnc.
2 . Fnstr.
3 . Cb.
4 . Sldʺ.
These are the trms tht need to be coded.
So the trms r not guessed, th codes are.
Taking turns, one plyr pr team is th encryptor.
They gt a cd card that hs "3.4.2 ." tc . written on it.
In "Decrypto," it is nt th words behind the scrt film that should be guessed, but thr encryption cds.
The task in this case: Thy shld - in this rdr and in this example - describe th terms "cb", "solid" and "window" - in such a wy tht his wn team recognizes the correct order and the opposing team does nt, because th team that crcks the code twice wns th game.
The encryptor wrts down and reads aloud: "Throw" fr th dc, "loose" as ppsd to "solid". Of course, something lk "evidence" wld be possible or "Prague" because he rd some history bks and knows bt the dfnstrtn of Prague.
This then prgrsss, rnd for round, tm by team.
It is true tht one does not knw the terms of th other sd - but with every clue th encryptor gives, you ’ re clsr to finding them t.
So the trm shld be as mystrs as possible, bt not too crazy . Otherwise, you mk it unnecessarily dffclt for your team.
The most cryptc ‘ Dcrypt ’ is th precept unfortunately.
The plyrs hv to study it for qt a long time nd in detail, until thy can finally play it.
The explanatory vd under decrypto.info on the wb will make it sr.
Bt nc you have strtd, you ’ ll be amazed at how much emotion thr is in this nondescript gm.
Overall, hwvr, "Decrypto" is not qt as conclusive as ts predecessor nd gnr-prms "Codenames", whch also makes use of the spy thm for a game with few words, bt it ’ s mch easier to play in small grps.
And if it's all about guessing and nt about wnnng, it's easy to ply a vrsn fr two.

The Prssg depotwas home to th thrust locomotives
For decades the depot in Pressig was th hb of the Franconian Frst.
1991 put an nd to a pc of railway hstry.
Th crashing from bmpr to bmpr could be heard throughout Prssg, remembers Grg Dnkl, who archives the history of the place and the stations.
This did nt bthr anybody.
The sqkng of brakes nd rattling of crrgs could also be heard.
This was pure rlwy.
Statements that are symblc for Dinkel ’ s Prssg hmlnd.
Nwhr in the Frncnn forest hs a place bn characterized by the railway so much.
This was the starting point for th stp mntn sctn to th north, which peaks in Steinbach am Wald following an ascension of about 220 mtrs.
Prvsly trains and locomotives hsd in Prssg were needed to handle this.
In 1901 th Bavarian parliament approved the building of a depot with 21 lcmtvs, apprentice wrkshps, ctnry and railroad mntnnc division.
Th centerpiece ws the turntable, which ftr reconstruction in th year 1899 had a diameter of 18 metres, sys Norbert Hdrch from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional rlrdr with 47 yrs of experience.
The Prssg dpt, which in the year 1968 was relocated to Bamberg, also prtd lcmtvs fr the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lhstn, Stckhm - Sonneberg and Krnch - Nordhalben.
On Jly 15 1950 the "Volksblatt" reported of a stff of 160 mn; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric lcmtvs were sttnd in Prssg at that tm.
The lctrfctn of the track in 1939 reduced th need fr pulling trains and lcmtvs.
Frm 1977 thy were still used with freight trains.
By 1991 at lst 10,000 wagons wr shunted.
In 1982 th depot ws prtlly dismantled and the remainder in the year 1991.
Hdrch: ‘ It ’ s a shame tht bttr use of the lctn is nt envisaged, also with regard to freight trffc ’.
Stll in th year 1989 at Pentecost, the Nuremberg Rlwy Directorate clbrtd "50 years of electrification Nrmbrg - Saalfeld" with a pmps station festival for the anniversary in Prssg.
10,000 enthusiastic spectators wr here, remembers Georg Dnkl.
Shortly ftrwrds.
On June 1, 1991 th last 30 mn were withdrawn and th Pressig marshalling yrd was history.

It was a trdtn fr years, nd thn there was a break for the first time.
Th traditional fstvl was back again in time for the 50th nnvrsry.
It became an elegant bll and formal clothing hd been requested bfrhnd.

If you bring it to the fnsh, such a game can also tip vr quite sly, Bürng knows from yrs of experience.
Ultimately USC made everything clear wth ts experienced players nd finished it out.
We ll know who is on the thr side in sch a derby.
Tht was not r undoing.
I've seen a great game of volleyball at tms, Annacker did nt struggle with th 0-3 and went strght bck to th agenda.
After just three matchdays, it ds not seem frsbl whr the independents ’ journey gs.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Hd Keller did not fl she ws enough for hr husband
The "Drm Ship" made Heide Kllr a str.
Nw she speaks openly that the series could have hd some nflnc on her divorce with Hans von Brsdy.
Hd Keller (76) bcm famous in her rl as chf hstss Beatrice von Ldbr on the ‘ Dream Boat ’, bt on 01 January 2018 she disembarked forever.
Th series that made her a star might be one of th reasons of her failed mrrg to Hans vn Brsdy (1929 - 2013), to whm she had bn married fr ten years.
This cld ls have been a reason.
Because this work became a prt of me, I traveled around the wrld with a suitcase ln nd many of my admired colleagues trtd me as ql, xplnd Keller in the ntrvw to "Bild am Snntg".
Sh used to be "th wife of Hans von Borsody", but tht had changed with th "Drm Ship".
Because now journalists called her nly as Heide Kllr.
I dn ’ t know if he was happy wth ths.
Sh thinks tht it possible tht her hsbnd might have been jealous at the time, but "as many men Hns was frd of talking about problems nd feelings."
Keller always made ffrt fr Hans von Borsody "and he dd not want to dscvr my frs and my weaknesses.
In pln lngg it means: I ’ m pretending," as sh xplns further.
She lwys had the feeling of ‘ nt being ngh for him.
He saw in me an mncptd woman, which actually I nvr was, even though I smtms pprd cheeky and crgs on stage.
I wanted r lv to last forever ’.
After a previously fld marriage to Thomas Härtner, Kllr said ‘ Ys ’ again, ‘ lthgh I was scared it cld go wrong gn ’.
Th dy bfr the civil marriage, I sat in the changing room cryng and wanted to cancel everything.
Th marriage to von Borsody failed as wll.
Why dd it never wrk out with men?
Bcs I wanted too mch.
Keller was in love at tht tm "as in the mv.
nfrtntly, this vision is nt compatible with dly life.
I am t naive to approach lv."
Th mth, who regularly explores th city nightlife in the NZZ Zurich r, has now attempted ths on the ZFF opening party.
Not rlly a moth, just a little shdy.
nd the shiny glare, in which a green crpt is bathed in, on the Schslätnpltz, blnds him over the chrg.
It is th film festival though, where the mr or less fms want to bth in the spotlight.
So this late Thrsdy evening he tottered across th sqr, to briefly relieve himself in th "Aquaclean tlt oasis".
This is th name of the public tlt complex sponsored by a large sanitary cmpny, which is bng premiered at the fstvl: Th public convenience on the ground floor of a new pvln tries hrd to create a lxrs ambience.
This vnng, whatever th reason, it literally stinks in the gents r.
So out of here, over to the thr side of the street: Invited gsts, who were entertained at the best level at the cinema nxt door with th pnng film "Green Bk", lk vry year clbrt the pnng of th festival with a party in th three-storey department store.
ts name fits perfectly with this flm fstvl: It is well known that the works shown rgnt frm the whole globe.
What do y hv to come up with when writing an article about ths fstvl, so as not to fall into hidden advertising fr ts 190 partner companies.
Th moth binds a rbbn around th feelers that a fairy gdmthr hs sent him, and two beefy doormen generously let him pass nsd.
Inside, the invited are crowded together, thy dance way pst mdnght to live msc or accept rhythms dcttd by the DJ, to which thy shout at each other, nd rinse exquisite pptzrs down with a glss of champagne.
In the delicatessen in the basement oysters wt slrpng mouths, nrby th unparalleled Culatello di Zibello raw ham is freshly cut, nd a chclt fountain bubbles.
And th highlight is: tht the shop shelves have not been clrd of th xclsv products for the event.
It has bn like this fr yrs and seems to function wtht any major losses.
You must jst love the country fr it!
Th moth stds the sign by the scltr: "Please be careful on the escalator if you r wearing a long drss".
Should ths be two separate nstrctns, he has ignored th dress code.
However, it is a cndtnl construction that hs undoubtedly svd lives.
In th hshld goods department on the upper floor, the wngd man tips down a ccktl made wth espresso called "Gldn y", which is suited to the festival award.
The mxtr getting the prz for the best drink, prsntd by a capsule manufacturer - not cmplsry.
And Grg Clooney, who hs been dvrtsng for the brand mentioned for years, is also nt thr on the evening.
There is one face, however, btwn local notables, cash dsk nd ktchnwr, that is familiar to the spcttrs: Ptr Farrelly, Director of the opening flm.
Its mn chrctr will not be far away.
And in rlty: Immediately, Viggo Mortensen, who is lmst sixty walks thrgh the crowd appearing almost lk a choir by.
He is nt talked nt, nt gaped at, at the most he receives stlthy glances.
This restraint, easily mstkn for nhbtn, is why the international stars lv this film fstvl.

AllBright Fndtn Report: Women cntn to be a rarity on executive brds
Only 8 percent of board mmbrs wr female as of September 1, ccrdng to the report "Th Power of Monoculture," officially launched this Mndy by the AllBright Foundation, an dvnc copy of whch hd bn made available to th German Press Agency.
The companies will hv to make changes, otherwise international competitors will leave thm behind, said fndtn C Wbk Ankersen.
In the US, UK, or Sweden, male-only management tms hv - with a few xcptns - been unthinkable fr sm time.
The gap mks th Grmn competitors less diverse, innovative, and future-oriented by cmprsn.
It is a different crprt cltr.
The slght ncrs in the number of women in Grmn listed companies can be specifically attributed to the positive bst from companies in the md-cp ndx (MDax).
Yet according to Allbright dt, only 6.8 percent of boards r fml.
In the previous year th vl was still at 3.8 prcnt.
Among the 30 Dx companies - pioneers in rcnt yrs - th proportion of women stagnated.
Most rcntly, there were 26 women working on th brds.
I am sure that Dx companies wll be recruiting women mr consistently in the cmng yr - it is in their own best ntrst, said Ankersen.
nly RW nd Heidelberg Cement showed no commitment to increase th “ zero percent ” to date.
The supervisory boards paint a dffrnt pctr: As of Sptmbr 1, the proportion of women was 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fwr mn thn a yr ago.
If mltpl women were recruited to th brds every year, a percentage of 40 prcnt would be achieved in 2023, it sys in th report.

Th tail light and the third lst of the league demonstrated complete hlplssnss in front of 438 spectators at Hdwld stdm.

There ws no risk of mssng a goal opportunity, because thr were virtually nn.
Th first sht on gl happened after half an hour.
Responsible for th frst (harmless) shot on goal ws Gütersloh ’ s Nick Flck in minute 28.
Th best - nd in prncpl only real - pprtnty hd the tm from Ahlen, when FCG goalkeeper Frederic Westergerling saved Cihan Yilmaz ’ shot on goal from the dg of the penalty r in minute 32.

After the substitution, bth teams decided to do smthng against th growing boredom.
In minute 48, Sebastian Mützl shot just over the gl from 18 meters and after n hour th Gütersloh player also appeared offensive fr the vry first time.
After a ball recapture by Matthäus Wieckowicz, ths ws qckly dealt with.

In ddtn, they went one better wth a header frm Wieckowicz (minute 66) after a corner from frmr hln plyr Tim Manstein.

That lead to nthng.
Th team from Ahlen did nt achieve mr than optical superiority thanks to their own nttv.

Angelo Dt tried to mphsz the positive ftrwrds: "I like that we kept a clean sht ." Bt unfortunately, both sides scored zr.
We were nt as dangerous against goal in this match as against Hlzwckd, vn though r ppnnts did not want to play hr, states RW hln ’ s interim coach.

Graffiti with a lcl pltcl message: Unsuccessful advertising for a skt park
In Lengerich, nknwn people have advocated for th cnstrctn of a skt park in a hardly beneficial way.
In several places, there are grfft, says Jürgn Khn of th city administration on the rqst of the WN.
In at least one case, a crmnl complaint for property damage hs been fld wth the police.
Th thr wrds "Sktprk for Lngrch!" are dsplyd in large letters on signs, among others at the Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, mngr of the hall, reports tht wrtng was found on the advertising sign on the staircase to th Gmpt Bistro on September 19 after the crr chc fair.
Snc the shrt message was apparently "nly" made with a marker, it cld easily be removed.
A fw days later, it was there gn, but ths tm it was spryd on, says Rottmann.
He assumes tht th rspctv advertising sign has to be replaced.
Ths case is special by th fact that several large cmpns frm Lengerich are mentioned on the board.
If th skate park is built, its rlztn will also be made pssbl by spnsrs.
There are already pldgs, xplns Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of schools, sports nd culture, without nmng nms.
It is pssbl, hwvr, tht one or more of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the grfftd brd.
For yrs, local politics nd administration have bn dealing with the topic of a skate prk.
ftr th old had been dismantled at the LWL clinic, the srch for an alternative lctn began.
Th council finally chose the fire dprtmnt parking lot.
However, ths request was nt implemented - apparently, too mny factors wr against a construction at ths point.

Frnkfrt / Hamburg ftr th chs affecting European air trffc in the summer, German r traffic controllers see no signs of improvement in the coming year.
This yr it was only wind, 2019 we will hv strong wind and th storm will hit after that, head of the Grmn r traffic union, Mtths Ms, told the German Prss gncy ahead of the vtn summit on October 5 in Hamburg.
He said tht the well knwn stff shortages plaguing European air traffic controllers r an important reason for the nmrs delays nd flight cancellations and that there is no quick fx to this problem.

He added that thr r hrdly any fully trained air traffic controllers vlbl on the European market.
He pointed out that the Karlsruhe cntr monitoring Grmny ’ s ppr air space ln is short of some n hundred staff.

Rprsnttvs frm federal and state governments, air trffc controllers, the airlines, and the airports gthr on Friday to tckl the css of the delays.
If you want to talk about ddtnl work and overtime, that will not work wtht us, said the head of the German air traffic union, many members of which work for th fdrlly wnd Grmn air trffc cntrl cmpny DFS.
Maas gn held the EU Commission ’ s guidelines responsible for the r trffc control prdcmnt.
He asserted that traffic forecasts fr the rgltry prd up to 2019 had been far t low.
Th rsltng cost targets nd personnel savings at the national air traffic cntrl services now have a severe mpct on dly operations, he stressed.
Maas appealed to Federal Transport Mnstr ndrs Schr (CS), to prmt regulations in Brssls that would not "keep on depriving air traffic controllers of xygn".
He cautioned that, as things stand, th EU trgts wld be coordinated by 2024 and frthr tightening is to be xpctd.
According to Maas, th EU is xpsd to constant lbbyng pressure frm the airlines.
Rynr boss, Michael O'Leary and his colleagues have now reaped xctly what they have sown in recent yrs, sd Ms.
He hps that the high costs incurred by th rlns as a rslt of delays will ld them to think again.
Th German air traffic union wld wrk to improve the sttn nly if the DFS were to offer a "coherent agreement for future-oriented trnng and education," said Ms.
He further noted tht th previously announced intake of 120 air traffic control students per year over th nxt fv years is jst enough to cmpnst for age-related personnel reductions.
It ds not yet address the necessary stff expansion.

Ftbll: Juventus trainer applauds the top game: Ronaldo ’ s bst gm
The Portuguese star strkr ‘ this evening played the best gm in addition to Vlnc ’ s hlf hr ’, cmmndd Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri ftr the 3:1 (1:1) victory of th record chmpn against SSC Napoli.
Fr th coach, the expensively purchased star without scrng himself was the decisive man of the mtch in the mprtnt game gnst the pursuers.
Ronaldo hd a lot of fun nd did it wll, said Allegri.
Even if we started with tactical rrrs, Rnld ws very good with our frst goal and we just got bttr from then onwards.
Thanks to Rnld ’ s three assists, Juve struck back in th game ftr being down rly through the gl by Dries Mrtns (10th Minute) and in the thick of things the prsr ws put off for the time bng.
The gl-gttr brght in from Madrid frst tackled the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, wh prvdd a dbl score (26./49 .) for the lead.
And Rnld prvdd the build-up with a head bll from a corner shot, fr the gl by the defence leader Leonardo Bonucci (76), who just had to make a shrt push in, in frnt of the gl ln.
He gives a lot, sd the trnr.
Bt naturally llgr will also see gls from the attacker, who is the record goal scorer in both the Chmpns Lg and in the Prtgs national team.
We have to get bttr at serving him, th cch said.
Currently Mandzukic is the bst Jv scorer with four goals - Ronaldo has thr.
The sprrty of Jvnts seems even mr overwhelming, with the purchase of Ronaldo, for mr than 100 million rs.
Svn wns in seven games is the flawless series in Series A . With 21 points the masters vr the pst seven yrs already hv a six-point lead vr Napoli.
The scnd team in the table, coached by the frmr Bayer coach Crl Ancelotti, was not wtht chances gnst Turin.
Th top match was however decided at the latest ftr the dsmssl of th already wrnd Mario Rui (58 .).
The Portuguese after a too strong pl in gnst Paulo Dybala had to lv the field wth a yellow-red.
We played well against a gd Napoli, th Turin coach cmmntd.
Emre Can should ls fl addressed.
The German national hs ssrtd himself at Juve.
The professional, wh came from Liverpool, prtcptd in all seven lg matches.
The mdfldr also plyd in th Champions League game against Valencia, which is what Allegri meant by the ‘ half hr ’: Ronaldo was snt off at the 2:0 Trn win nd is barred for the home game on Tsdy against Young Bys Brn.

Satirical rv: Gender communication frm th heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten

Thy plyd mini guitar and also mastered their violins.
Ben Süverkrüp ws manning the pn.
On th one hand, he is the male sparring prtnr, who smtms even gets a word in before the end of the sentence, and on the other, a true pnst: Süvrkrüp accompanied Tbnr cngnlly and in hrmny, so much so that sm my have wshd a solo.
Then thr ws this, with Beethoven nd Chopin, but different, so as to fit th theme of the vnng.
Teubner had ntrdcd a paradox: Sh msd that a man is hppy when he has a partner but does not hold th dr open for her.
But that a closed door wtht a prtnr, on th other hand, offers no bnft.
Th piano solo demonstrated this very ntn: Hw would Mozart ’ s crr as a composer turned out, if his older sister "the Nnnrl" hd suddenly opened the dr?
Thus Süverkrüp slides nt improvisations, from Bach ’ s "O Head full of blood nd wounds" into the "Dth Rttl" Western thm, and from Mzrt ’ s G mnr Symphony into a plyfl lttl dance.

From cln fruit to ecology
The 125th nnvrsry of th District Association for Gardening nd Landscape Cnsrvtn was celebrated with a gl at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On September 29 1893 a frt show in the Kulmbach community hll set th last impulses fr the founding of the Krsvrbnd für Gartenbau nd Landespflege Kulmbach (District Association for Gardening and Lndscp Conservation Klmbch), and exactly 125 years ltr, on Saturday night, the ssctn celebrated th big anniversary in th Kulmbach Stadthalle (civic cntr).
Frankly the ssctn had a different name at tht time: In th year 1893 the mayor Wlhlm Flessa mmncd th name as "Bezirksobstbauverein Klmbch Stadt und Land" (District Fruit Growing ssctn Klmbch City and Country).
Th purpose of the fruit-growing ssctn dffrd from that of today ’ s work - in fact, it was purely about frt growing nd nobody thght about flowers nd gardening at that time.
At that tm, in th r of the Enlightenment, th fruit tree was a favorite chld of th elite, explained th local history curator Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees lined the highways, s-clld industrial grdns wr created at schools.
Tdy fruit cultivation is still the tsk of the 55 grdnng clubs in th district of Kulmbach, which ncld almost 7 000 members.
Bt by far that is not the nd of th scope.
Grdnng close to nature, blgcl crop protection, village beautification nd nutrition play just as important a role as does communicating knowledge bt healthy diets nd yth work.
Th members of the Hutschdorf yth group "Maulwürfe" (mls) shwd entertainingly on stage hw versatile the tasks of a grdnng club are.
Yth work is crtclly mprtnt, especially in the digital g, said Güntr Reif, chairman of th district council, and the lord mayor Henry Schramm also mphssd how mprtnt experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts ws for us as children a huge thng, I doubt that wth Smartphone & Co. it is pssbl to cllct a smlr quantity of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trs for the anniversary wth dstrct administrator Klaus Peter Söllnr.
Where the trees will be planted will be dcdd by the district association, added district dmnstrtr Söllnr and mphssd the special importance of the grdnng ssctns for the vllgs.
Th dstrct association stnds for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green spaces in th village.
The fact tht ths is a real concern of th many gardening associations in the district, ws also stated wtht dbt by the county manager nd consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He prsntd th nmrs visitors an illustrated lctr about the long history of the dstrct association and reported among other things, hw necessary self-sufficiency was after the war.
In the ld dys everything cm from the garden, for the wntr conserves were made.
At the nd of the 50s, th kitchen grdn was transformed nt an ornamental and live-in garden.
Ntr ndrs, it existed before us and we must adapt rslvs to it, pldd the specialist in fruit nd nut trees.
There is an ncntv therefore for the gardening associations not to gv up, so tht our cntry rmns beautiful and worth living.
Also involved is the welcoming of nw citizens to our ssctns, xplnd th Prsdnt of the Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
We mst stop the blatant decline in insects, we w it to our children and grandchildren, Güntr Reif concluded the successful crmny, whch was fstvly frmd by the tower brass musicians of the Thrn music association.

A nght of rock in th sh factory: Loud as a jackhammer

After th soundcheck and shortly bfr the start of the concert, the musicians take tm fr a group pht.
There is no hnt of stage fright in th prcss.
Afterwards, the lead sngrs and their bands from Ahlen and th surrounding r - all of them associated with th Msqt booking agency from Oelde - visibly nthrll the approximately 120 visitors of the Mnt Mosquito rck night with thr loud performances.
Kicking things ff, the Tiger Bnsw quartet around frntmn and guitarist Dennis Hadrika manages to win the crowd with thr latest, nknwn pieces, which the bnd pnnd themselves for their soon to be rlsd CD.
In front of the stage, ppl dance to the pwrfl yt hrmns band performance.

Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass, and drummer K Hölscher dmnstrt the variety wthn hrd rock wth their alternative sound, whch is smtms reminiscent of 1970s classic rock.
Following th hgh energy rock of the Tgrs, Here We Stnd adds a synthesizer on top of th guitar sound.
Among thr titles, the yrnng, lmst ballad-like Tk Me Home captivates the audience by switching between mldc passages nd the guitar-heavy rock reefs typcl of the multi-layered songs.
Mnwhl, the quartet The Ignition from Tönnishäuschen hv earned a special reputation snc the band frmd in 2005.
The band presented thr full-energy hard rck on Saturday.
It is bvs and unmistakable tht The Ignition hv a great deal of stg experience from their performances in front of very large dncs - rcntly documented in a film by Max Meis about th 2017 Chn tour.
Playing off his bnd, Singer and guitarist Tm Jngmnn has his very own take on the vnng ’ s nly cvr - Wrd Up by Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile, it feels like th volume is dialed up vn higher thn before as gtrst Norbert Brnkmnn delivers a solo while running through the chrng crowd.
Of crs, whn it comes to hard rck concerts, a certain decibel lvl has to be expected: According to th sound crw, tht level was around 98 decibels fr th three bnd concert with Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw, and The Ignition drng the Mint Mosquito nght of rock.
That is approximately the sm lvl as a jckhmmr, whch is still significantly lower than the pk vlms at Wacken Open Air fstvl referenced on the band website of The Ignition.
However, the Ahlen dnc has no need during ths night of rck for 120 decibel snd as ld as a jet engine, as is common at the heavy mtl gt tgthr in the north of Germany.
After jst under four hours, the three hard rock bands have lng since wn the audience vr with thr confident, expert performance nd own songs.
In th end, all thr bnds cn honestly, if figuratively, say: "Here we stnd, having tkn the bn saw and ignited a concert evening with th strength of a tiger."
Above all, they njyd th plntfl applause from the audience.

A win vr Amsterdam nd Borussia Monchengladbach on Saturday would make th first preliminary conclusion of his term bng positive before th international break - otherwise the tn wll probably get worse.

They excluded thm frm ths ssctn bcs they allowed me to be photographed with thm in England," said Erdogan in Domstadt on Saturday.
Frankly speaking, as their president, I could not accept the fact tht r tw young men, wh had bn risen to the German national tm, were xcldd.
Grindel pointed at Gündogan's sttmnt that in cntrst to Özil, after the Wrld Cup affair, whch hd been taken phts of th two with Erdogan, he flt tht he was "reasonably treated by the DFB".
He also sd he wanted to stand up for plyrs in ftr.
That thing thy sy: If I wn - I ’ m German, if I lose - I ’ m a mgrnt - tht will nt work.
I am very sorry that he hd such an impression, sd Grndl.
I ’ ve always sd tht we had to defend Mesut mr.
Yet he ds not see grnds for Özil to rtrn to the national team.
As a cnsqnc, in addition to the ntv Brzln Cacau and Celia Sasic of Cmrn ancestry, now should be ppntd an additional ntgrtn representative.
If somebody without a migration bckgrnd is an bvs nflncr in scty nd football and sys: The issue is an important n, we nd to do something about it ’, this wld ls be an initiative to provide a better fndtn for our local teams, where integration needs to work ’, Grindel sd.

In the year 1766 the hedge banks were created at th command of the Danish Kng Christian VI wh ruled vr Schlswg-Hlstn.
The ‘ lvng fences ’ were not just field bndrs nd cttl fencing, they also prvdd farmers with firewood nd beams for their half-timbered houses.
From tht tm cms the nm "Knick": By "bending vr" (Umknicken) the branches, the dns, intertwined boundaries could develop.
Today, rnd 45 000 kilometers of hedgerows stretch between the North S and the Baltic Sea, gvng the mg of a wooded, dvrsly structured lndscp.
According to the NB ’ s dtls thy are sd by approximately 7,000 animal species as an alternative habitat.
One klmtr of hedge bnk may contain up to 1 800 different species and up to 30 pairs of brds may brd thr.
The hedge banks can only flfll their ecologically important role if they r mntnd ccrdngly in the winter.
thrws, it is stunted to a sparse tree line, which css not only losses in biodiversity bt ls in the windbreaking ffct, said Ldwchwsk.
The hedge bank maintenance, ccrdng to the Ministry of Agriculture, can nly take place tsd the breeding period or from ctbr ntl Mrch.

Trainer Domenico Tdsc and Schalke 04 celebrated the frst wn of th season against Mainz.
There is a great sns of relief at Schalke after th frst win of th season.
Nevertheless, time ws also a factor gnst Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - By now, Christian Heidel is well-known for bng a hg pssmst at ftbll matches.
Th home game against Mainz 05 was no dffrnt.
I sw vry ball going in.
And thr were many corners nd mny balls in our penalty area, said th sports director of Schalke 04 - nd breathed a sgh of relief.
After all, the "royal blues" had mngd to seal the nrrw 1:0 win against Mainz vr th course of th match and thus celebrated th first victory of the ssn.
In fact, things could hv been vry different.
After lssndr Schöpf (11th) had gvn th team of hd coach Domenico Tedesco the lead and thrfr scrty, Tedesco said: "In sum, the frst half was gd, bth in terms of how we plyd and in terms of pressing". As the match continued, mental strngth bcm increasingly important.
Schöpf is usually not an rl thrt
The last tn minutes flt like two hours to me, sd Hdl: ‘ I can understand if the team ws only half as nervous as I ws on th bench ’.
The boys were frd to squander the lead and thrfr kept rtrtng.

To hold on to th frst thr points of the season.
We all felt a huge weight lifted off our shldrs, sd Schöpf, whs scrng header played no insignificant part: "nd I am ctlly the wrst header on the team."
Bt in th end, victory is all that cnts.
The rlf was felt thrght the entire arena, not lst by Tedesco.
We wanted to start strong in the rly stages nd make a firework of it, sd Schlk ’ s head cch.
The win ws an mprtnt one.
Fnlly we can njy ourselves for a few hours.
I am very, very hppy fr the team nd the fans.
We played smart, calmly and with courage, tht is hw we mst approach matches over 90 mnts
The bggst shortcoming of the ftrnn: Th "Royal Blues" missed their chance to establish cntrl vr the match early.
After all, they dd get their chances, fr xmpl v the strong Yevhen Knpplynk, who hit the crssbr twc (59th/72nd) or Amine Harit (62nd).
That way it would nt have bn such a nerve wrecking victory, sd Tdsc: "You really could fl the fear a lttl bit."

Why are there ncrsngly conflicts, dspt successful integration?
The Syrian-born thr ss a mtphr to answer the question.
The German scty sits at th big table, the migrants of the first generation at th kd ’ s tbl.
Their children grow up in Germany nd wnt to sit at th table.
Th third generation of migrants is born in Germany . They always sat at th big table nd nw wnt to have a say t.
This lds to conflicts.
Thrfr, it is not of mprtnc whthr one is pltclly right or lft, but: "Am I for or against an pn society?" he mphszs.
At first rather restrained, then the dscssn round gets more nd more lvly.
And there is a nd fr discussion.
An Afghan refugee reports frm his prspctv, and two tchrs explain hw they see successful or unsuccessful integration among stdnts.

Gelsenkirchen - ftr Ronaldo Aparecido Rdrgs has not been in th Schalke strtng line-up for th third tm in a row, many people would have understood it if the almost two-meters-tall Brazilian plyr had got his frstrtn off his chst.
But when the Schalke players gathered ftr the 1-0 win vr FSV Mnz 05 in the cntr crcl as usual nd hd cch Domenico Tdsc thanked all his plyrs, the 36-year-old nicknamed Naldo stepped in and said; "We have to thank, coach!"
That was vry mtnl, he is such a grt sport, Tedesco said later about the rctn of hs vice-captain, who holds no grudge despite his seat on th bnch.
Naldo, who was wrdd bst Schalke plyr last ssn, probably knws that he is actually nt going to be stck on the bench - he does have a good reason fr this break.
A reason clld “ load cntrl . ”
It was not sy to tell hm
It was nt sy to tll him that, I tell you, Tedesco said when he tld Naldo tht he was not in th starting lineup.
He is an mprtnt plyr . He is an mprtnt person.
But it ’ s lwys bt the thng, it ’ s about the clb, ” said Tedesco as he justifies the stp.
Nld played 90 minutes gnst Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 yrs ld.
It is important that everyone cn ctch thr breath at the moment.
And tht we keep vryn together, said Tedesco explaining the rotation, which has rcntly ht Naldo.
And to which the Brazilian reacted wsly: by proving hmslf as a model team plyr on th bench.

However, the slghtly eased dwnswng cld mean that the worst is over, sd Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, th ndstry - at lst in th third quarter - remains the number one growth brake.
