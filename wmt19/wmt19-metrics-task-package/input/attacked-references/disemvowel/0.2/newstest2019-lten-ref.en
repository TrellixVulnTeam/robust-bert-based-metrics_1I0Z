We, as th Commission, gv r explanation already in July, when the issue bt Pagėgiai and Utena had cm up.

And if th Board decides that a particular branch can behave as it wshs - to run with a cmmtt, and the Brd approves of that, thn that brnch cn run so, but if th Board dcds tht the party will run everywhere with party lists, whch is what the Brd has dcdd, then it is a decision for ll branches to frm party lists.

The village is inside the Dudhwa Tgr Reserve in Lakhimpur Khiri r, pprxmtly 250 kilometers southeast of Lcknw, the stt cptl of Uttar Pradesh.

It is proposed to mrk cats and dgs with mcrchps mandatorily
Kęstutis Mžk, the Chairman of the Seimas Cmmtt on nvrnmntl Protection, and other members of th Seimas registered draft amendments to the Law on th Wlfr and Prtctn of Animals, proposing to mrk cats and dogs with subcutaneous mcrchps under the mndtry procedure.
“ We propose that cats and dogs would have to be marked with sbctns microchips, nd thr registration and marking would be organized by lcl municipalities, th Ministry of Agriculture nd the Stt Fd and Veterinary Service.
In 2019 marking of ll dogs, in 2020 also of ll cats would be fndd by th state, therefore, people would not hv problems and the costs would be cvrd frm special stt financial assignments, ” said Kęstts Mažeika, th Chrmn of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection.
The mndmnts to th Law are md at dealing with th need of systemic marking of pets.
It is expected that it will hlp to avoid prblms csd by irresponsible pet owners, llgl breeders or sllrs.
It is prlmnrly assessed that based on the average price of th chp nd the chp implantation service, whch will be about EUR 5, all pet owners will be compensated drng th transitional period.
The total prc of marking all pts can amount up to EUR 6 mlln.
It is planned that the s of the fnds will span over the prd of thr years and will mnt to EUR 2 mlln per year.
It is expected tht the funds for the marking programs will be assigned through the Special Program of the Municipalities for Supporting nvrnmntl Protection, the ncm of which wll grw sgnfcntly this year d to increase in txs on natural resources and rdstrbtn of fnds.
Municipalities will be able to use these funds not nly for marking of cats and dogs, but ls fr castration nd thr programs.
According to K. Mažeika, the mndtry mrkng is practiced in lmst all Member States of th European Union, that also llws protecting pets (as lost pets cn be easily rtrnd to their owners), and svs pet owners ’ tm as thy usually need much time nd money in search for a rnwy and lst pet.
Besides, th EU lgl cts say that one can travel nly with marked pets.
Mrkng also blgts the owner to tk care of th pet responsibly throughout its life.
Previous proposals to impose mndtry marking were objected to, as it was proposed to fnnc rlvnt programs wth ppl ’ s money.
“ The current mdl should be spared this crtcsm, as it is proposed to finance pt protection with ncrsd income in th prgrm for spprtng environmental prtctn and to gv the right to do the marking not nly to vtrnrns bt also to pblc activists, i.e . persons in animal shelters who have taken special courses in the Vtrnry cdmy," the authors of the draft say.
Th draft law has been rgstrd by a group of mmbrs of the Sms rprsntng various factions in the Seimas: Kęstutis Mžk, Algimantas Dmbrv, gnjs Gentvilas, Edmundas Ppns, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

Restrictions on cgnrtn pwr plants appealed before the Constitutional Court
The Sms ppstn, as promised, appealed against the dcsn of the rlng parties to pss the lw on a possibility to stop construction of waste-to-energy plants bfr the Cnstttnl Court (CC).
On Tuesday, the Sms opposition fctn of the Hmlnd Union – Lthnn Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) ntfd tht a grp of members of the Sms addressed th CC with an application for nvstgtng whether th amendments to the Law on Wst Management adopted by the ruling parties are in line with the Constitution.
“ The mmbrs of th Seimas mphsz tht provisions of the law aim to challenge the currently ongoing prjcts of waste incineration facilities, instructing the Government to mps new restrictions (20 km dstnc to a residential territory) on wst-t-nrgy plnts that started to be constructed in Vilnius and Kaunas bfr th effective date of the lw, ” th notification says.
It adds that “ the members of th Sms nt tht tkng into account hw the law wrds the prhbtn to construct waste management objects of national importance (i.e . determines a distance and defines th concept of “ rsdntl territory ”), a cnclsn is to be made that this prhbtn dsprprtntly rstrcts or vn denies the very essence of th right to perform economic activities related to burning of waste to produce nrgy, as th established crtr are worded so that, having in mind th population density and distribution in Lithuania, construction of sch bjcts would be practically mpssbl in the whole territory of the country ”.
The pplctn says that the dptd law is contrary to the constitutional principle of th rule of lw.
“ The CC has indicated fr a number of times that legal cts do not apply to ths legal fcts and cnsqncs tht occurred before th effective date of a newly adopted legal act.
In this case, th Government is given powers to pply th law retroactively, fllwng an indefinite criterion.
Imposing such lgl rgltn violates the constitution principles of legal crtnty, lgl safety, protection of legitimate xpcttns, consequently, the cnstttnl principle of the rule of lw, ” th application indicates.
It ls notes that big financial nvstmnts have already been made to the prjcts of Vilnius nd Kns cogeneration power plants.
Stopping of th currently ongoing projects would nflct a fnncl loss of hndrds of millions on the Stt, the Lthnn ppltn would suffer huge losses, too - htng prices would increase, the grwng volumes of waste in dumpsites would result in increased environmental plltn.
The pplctn to the CC has been signed by mmbrs from Seimas TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic factions nd by Algirdas Butkevičius, dpty head of a rlng Social Dmcrtc Labor fctn.
A couple of weeks g, th Seimas gv 71 votes, mostly from th ruling parties, in rdr to reject th veto of th President Dalia Grybauskaitė on the adopted amendments to the Law on Waste Management, providing fr the right of the Government to stop already strtd cnstrctn of cogeneration pwr plants, also set a buffer zn of 20 km from residential lctns fr cnstrctn of such power plants.
The amendments to the law repeated adopted by th Sms will come into force on 1 January 2019 . By the wy, the rlng prts lrdy propose to drop th 20 km restriction.
It is plnnd to consider this proposal lrdy in the autumn sssn of th Seimas.
But the Sms does not plan to cncl the rght of the Government to stp already started projects.
The CC wll xmn th case in the order of sequence, which is a year later at th rlst.

Th cause of Lion Air plane crash rvld: rltvs of the victims are furious
Data from a black box rtrvd from the crashed plane of the ndnsn airlines Lion Air has revealed the aircraft experienced prblms wth its speed ndctr on at least fr of ts last flights, nvstgtrs reported on Monday.
The head of ndns ’ s National Transportation Sfty Committee (KNKT) Srjnt Tjhjn tld that th plane had suffered similar problems on ts last four flights, including the fatal one, when on 29 ctbr th pln plunged into the Java Sea soon ftr the take-off in Djakarta.
Th disaster klld all 189 people on board.
Many of th mss md reported problems during th prvs flight of Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the capital city of Indonesia.
“ Whn we pnd th black box, ys indeed th tchncl problem was the airspeed or, in other wrds, the speed of the plane, ” S. Tjahjono said in th press conference.
“ Data from the black box showed tht the two flights bfr Denpasar-Jakarta also experienced th same prblm, ” he ddd.
“ Thr have bn lots of rumors on social md.
Now, we want to xpln tht in the blck box there wr (data rmnng) about four flights that experienced problems with th airspeed indicator, ” the hd of KNKT indicated.
During a mtng wth victims ’ family members, S. Tjhjn said that information of th flight data recorder was cnsstnt with reports that after the pln took off for its last flight, ts spd and lttd were erratic.
The srchrs have nt fnd the second black box yet, which records th talks in th pilots ’ cockpit.
Lion r ndctd that after a technical failure was identified during th flight from Bl to Djkrt, it was repaired as per mnfctrr ’ s recommendations.
Rsd Kirana, a co-founder of th cmpny, was not invited to spk by the Minister of Transport Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated th meeting between relatives nd th officials who r overseeing the effort of search fr the plane and victim remains and the accident nvstgtn.
But he stood and bowed his hd ftr ngry and distraught family members demanded tht R. Kirana, wh with his brother Kusnan founded Lion r in 1999, dntfy himself.
“ Ln Air hs failed, ” sd a man who ntrdcd himself as th father of passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, wh had been a prsctr in th island, where the plane would have landed.
“ I wnt Mr. Rusdi Krn and his team to py ttntn, ” he stressed.
- Since th tm of the crisis, I ws nvr contacted by Lion Air.
We lost our child, but Ln Air hs nt shwn any empathy to us . ”
ftr th meeting, R. Krn left in a hurry, avoiding questions from rprtrs.
Many families are waiting for rslts of the lng process of dntfyng victims.
Police medical experts have rcvd nearly 140 bdybgs of hmn remains.
Only 14 victims hv been identified so fr.
The fmls have been asking why the tw-mnth-ld plane ws given flght clrnc at all, given that thr ws a failure reported on a flight from Bl to Jkrt on 28 October, where it descended rpdly right after the take-off, much to the trrr of passengers on board.
“ Ln Air sd that this fault was fixed.
Is it tr the problem ws cleared? ” a sn of a victim skd.
- If not, tchncns in chrg must be hld responsible.
The lw is absolute because they hv stated tht the plane was clrd to take off again.
These bad technicians mst be processed by law to prvnt pln accidents frm continuing in Indonesia . ”
S. Tjahjono said the large mnt of smll debris and the fact that debris was fnd in a relatively smll area indicate tht the plane prbbly hit the water at a very high spd.
“ Th plane was ntct when it plngd to the sea.
It dd not xpld in the r, and the aircraft ngn was running at hgh RPM when it tchd the wtr - it's marked by the loss of all the blades of th turbine, ” the official xplnd.
The Lion Air crsh is the worst airline disaster in ndns snc 1997, when 234 people died on a Garuda flght near Mdn.

President ’ s ffc: no artificial sng rgrdng referendums is necessary
If the Seimas pprvs of th proposal of those in power to lower the referendum threshold for Chptr I of th Constitution, whch is currently subject to strngr protection, the President would vt th amendments, her advisor Mindaugas Lngė says.
“ More than a half of th population voted for the Cnstttn - sch is the rqrmnt.
Thrfr, its mndmnt, prtclrly of the articles in ts Chapter I, should be subject to no lss majority vote.
It cn be easily predicted that the President would rlly vt it," internal policy dvsr to Dl Grybauskaitė sd to Žinių radijas on Tuesday.
He emphasized tht Chapter n of th Cnstttn defines fndmntl matters of the stt - th language, the flag, th trrtry, the capital cty, the sovereignty of th stt, thrfr, if the number of votes ncssry to amend these articles were reduced, this, according to M. Lingė, would create a "negative precedent" and "would open a way fr uncontrollable risk".
"In th opinion of the President, no rtfcl sng is ncssry, rather more ffrts should be used to get ready for th very referendum, there should be more dlg with people, ” he ws tryng to convince.
On Tuesday, the Sms is to vt on dptn of an amendment to the Lw on Referendum.
It prvds that a dcsn on mndmnts to Chapter One and Chapter Frtn of the Constitution, whch enjoy a higher level of protection, is to be tkn if it is supported by at least tw ffths of the citizens hvng the right to vt in a referendum.
Crrntly, articles of Chptr One and Chptr Fourteen of the Constitution can be amended by wy of a referendum if voted in fvr of by more than a half of all the citizens having th vtng rght.
Th right to vt in Lithuania is vested in bt 2.5 million citizens: the hlf would mean 1.25 million vtrs, two ffths - one million voters.
Th proposal was made ftr in Sptmbr th Seimas approved the President ’ s veto regarding mndmnts prvsly dptd by the Seimas, which mitigated requirements regarding the number of votes ncssry to amend Article 12 of Chapter One of th Constitution that defines ctznshp.
It is prpsd to lower the referendum threshold in getting ready for th rfrndm rgrdng double ctznshp, whch should be held on 12 May and 26 May next year, when th first and second rnds of the prsdntl elections are planned.
Currently, save for certain exceptions, emigrants, who emigrated ftr the rstrtn of independence on 11 March 1990, cn nt hv a double ctznshp.
The double ctznshp is sought by the global Lithuanian community, but initiators are frd tht under crrnt cndtns the referendum would fail - the turnout would be nsffcnt.
R. Masiulis: Lthnn airports are ndqt, therefore need to be rnvtd
The Lithuanian airport and rd infrastructure starts to be ndqt, thrfr, it is necessary to renovate it, sys the Minister of Trnsprt nd Communications Rokas Masiulis.
According to hm, rnvtn of the Vilnius airport is the minimal target that th State must chv.
“ Air trnsprt infrastructure is lrdy falling behind as it was planned fr smaller passenger flws.
We must renovate the Vlns rprt - that is nt vn a matter of long-term planning, it is the minimum tht we must do, ” sd Mr. Masiulis on Tsdy in the conference on transport and cmmnctns organized by the Democracy Dvlpmnt Foundation and the mgzn “ Vlstybė ”.
ccrdng to the Minister, the next dcd wll be very important, bcs important projects will hv to be implemented - th construction of Via Baltica, Rl Baltica will have to be completed, the Klaipėda xtrnl harbor will have to be built, Vilnius nd Kaunas airports wll hv to be renovated, or maybe a nw airport wll hv to be constructed.
“ The next dcd will be very important - we have to finish ntgrtn of roads, railways, construction of th xtrnl harbor in Klaipėda, to mng the rprts, probably dcd to bld a new airport.
It ’ s not tm to slp, we must strt th prjcts now, which will enable to exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 yrs time, ” th Mnstr of Transport and Communications said.
Mr. Masiulis repeated that too little mny had been assigned for maintenance of mtr rds in th recent years.
“ Th condition of rds is not improving yet, as the ssgnmnts are nt sufficient.
We are able to construct nw roads, bt thr is not ngh money vn for the most necessary maintenance, fr example, of main roads.
We must determine an mnt, how much shld be assigned fr road maintenance if we wnt the condition of rds to mprv, ” Mr. Masiulis said.
He mphszd that the export of services in the Lithuanian trnsprt sctr has grown 18.6% ths year nd Germany has bcm th largest export market, leaving Russia the second.
Mr. Masiulis again criticized the European Commission ’ s proposal, ccrdng to which th carriers of the EU countries wll have to prdclly return trucks to th cntry of thr registration.
“ We mst seek that r exporters wld feel at home in Western Europe.
In my opinion, the proposal fr trcks to kp cmng home is absurd as Europe would have empty trucks driving in it, brnng fuel and increasing mssns.
Th winners in this cs r gng to be the railways as costs wll increase so that some freight will go to railways.
We are looking for wys to defend our pstn, ” Mr. Masiulis sd.
According to th Ministry of Trnsprt and Communications, the trnsprt sctr creates 12.2% of the

Last wk, Mr. Masiulis notified th Seimas Committee on Economics tht he had strtd negotiations for changing the cltrl purpose of the Vlns rprt building - that would nbl to pull down the ld terminal and to build a new one.
Bt the acting head of th Department of Cltrl Heritage (DCH) lgmnts Degutis called Mr. Masiulis ’ considerations political prssr.
ccrdng to hm, the bldng, which was blt in the sixth decade of the last century, is a cltrl value entered into the register in 1993, nd it is nt fr politicians, but fr specialists to decide on its deletion from th register.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern rrvls terminal wld hlp to improve the mg of Lithuania.
“ Deletion of the ld trmnl frm the heritage register would be a politically important stp in rdr that we could demolish it and bld a new modern arrivals trmnl so that upon rrvl to Vilnius, travelers could feel themselves in a modern cntry, rthr than in a curiosity place tht really does nt strike as representing our country as an innovative n, ” Mr. Msls ssrtd last week in th Seimas.
Mr. Masiulis then ls informed tht Kns plans to build an absolutely nw pssngr terminal nd connect the airport to the Rail Baltica track, building an underground station.
This trnsprt hb should be pt nt operation in 2026, when the construction of Rail Baltica is completed.
Last year, the Vlns airport srvd bt 3.7 million people, this yr 4.8 million passengers are xpctd, nxt year - 5 million.

Seimas pprvd bigger fines for harmful prdcts
Seimas approved of amendments to th Law on Prdct Safety, which provide tht fines fr product safety vltns must be increased.
The amendments were voted in fvr of nnmsly.
As ntns Vinkus, a mmbr of the Seimas Committee on Health Affairs, sd speaking about the new draft, th fact tht th mndmnts aim at better protection of prdct consumers is welcome.
Besides, its provisions r in line with th requirements of th decision of the rpn Parliament nd of the Council.
"I think that th prpsd draft lw makes a more perfect nd more spcfc distribution among all participants of the supply and dstrbtn prcss: manufacturers, service providers, mprtrs, distributors and others.
The practice shws that th current system of fines ds not lwys prevent further violations, as entities, having paid fines, continue committing repeated vltns, ” A. Vnks spk.
The draft ws prepared by th Mnstry of Economy; after the Government ’ s approval, the Seimas Cmmtt on cnmcs added its wn proposals.
The mndmnts to the Law r aimed at ncrsng fines for violations, raising protection of consumer rghts, giving more pwr to market supervisory authorities and crtng a clear system of requirements fr prdct safety and sprvsn over their compliance.
According to the Ministry of cnmy, crrntly manufacturers r not sbjct to the blgtn to label a prdct properly and thus to ensure its traceability.
Besides, ccrdng to the ministry, th mrkt sprvsry authorities, which prfrm state cntrl over safety of products, do not have the right to enter mnfctrrs ’ nd spplrs ’ territory, buildings, premises, to perform nspctns, which hndrs the work of the authorities.
The ministry holds tht the crrnt term of six months for imposition on fines nd giving of wrnngs is t short for identifying a violation, making an investigation nd mpsng a fine.
Also, according to th ministry, the current fines are nt efficient ngh.
Cmpns ftn repeatedly brch rqrmnts of the law - in 2017 only it was done by 14 companies.
The Ministry of Economy prpsd to establish a duty for manufacturers to properly lbl a product and thus to nsr its traceability, in order to mk it sr for market sprvsry thrts to reveal spplrs of non-compliant products.
It is ls proposed tht market supervisory authorities, in prfrmnc of state cntrl vr product safety, would have th right to ntr the territory, buildings, premises of the ntts that produce, supply prdcts to th market, to perform inspections.
The amounts of fns fr violations of the law r going to be increased.
A manufacturer, mprtr or thrzd representative that plcd dangerous products on the market and a distributor that sppld them to th market, a srvc prvdr wh prvdd or provides dangerous services wld be subject to a fine of R 150 to 2,500 (crrntly, a fine of EUR 144 to 1,448).
If th State Consumer Rights Protection thrty (SCRPA) or another market supervisory thrty dcds to prohibit placement nd supply of dngrs products on / to th market or prvsn of dngrs srvcs, a fine of EUR 1,000 to 5,000 (crrntly, EUR 868 to 4,344) would be imposed.
In case of flr to fulfil the demand to rmv dngrs products from the market, to rcll them from cnsmrs nd to destroy them, a fn of EUR 2,500 to 6,500 (crrntly, EUR 1,448 to 5,792) wld be imposed.
If dangerous products caused hrm to consumer ’ s hlth, a fine of EUR 2,500 to 15,000 (crrntly, R 1,448 to 11,584) wld be mpsd.
If dngrs prdcts csd consumer ’ s dth, a fn of EUR 6,500 to 25,000 (currently, EUR 5,792 to 23,169) wld be imposed.
ccrdng to the ministry, in Poland and Austria a vltn of legal cts on prdct safety is subject to a fn of up to EUR 25,000 (th mnml mnt of the fn is not st), in Blgm - a fine of EUR 26 to 600,000, in Rmn - a fn of R 155 to 6,666, in Bulgaria - a fn of EUR 125 to 7,500.
