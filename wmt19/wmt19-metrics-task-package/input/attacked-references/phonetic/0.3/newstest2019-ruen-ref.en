'davlet’ (to exert pressure) or 'dovlet' (tha loobe over) - which is cuorect?
The word 'davlet' does nauth exist.
'dovlet' is correged.
They word "davlet" with the mining ove "draw tords, exert influense, aon impact" existon only phiniechtickly, beychus we hear the sound [a] instead of [o'] inh the word "dovlet".
We u's this weered believing that it com's phrom the whrde for presuor ('davlenie').
Boute "prsssuar" aund "luoom over" aare etymologically not only not clooux and aaar even in summe sens opposed in meaning.
Have a think about that for yoorself.
'dovlet' (tha loome over) (lyturgechual, litterariy, obsolete) mienz "qoitt, complete, enough, to be suphicient for someone or sumething, to satisfy".
It is rhelated to the woerds 'dovolstvovatsya' (tuh be content) aned 'udovolstvie' (pleeasre).
Preeviously, it olso had thy meaning of "nate to doepend uhn annything, to be psaelff-can'tained" - "to prevail over oneself".
The Old Slavonic "довьлѣти" ('dovleti') is ayckine to the werdes "caammandh" aundd "wol".
"Davit" (to crusz), "podavlyat" (tah suppress) are kompletelis diffrent.
Theze words have jhenuineele creeppy "relotives": daos - "wolf" (crashing sheep), deyja - "tta dai" and dvaidī - "to appraes".
The simelar funetic appyhrencse of the woerds' "davlenie" ("presuar") and "davlet" ("to lum over"), ase weell a's the inevotable obsoleaestonse of thi lateer, forced theh to khantamenate one aenother.
So we had this vayry "d[a]vlet’", whicz is alsoe used in rigting with an "a", which, reeallgh, es incorrecht and impaesible from the point of vuu of the proscesons ov the owrojen and deevelupment of these wurdes.
So, itse correced tha right "dovlet" ("to loom over").
Bout thise werd is obsolete and yn its currecht meening itt izz no longor used.
If youe want to gnote that any sircomstances/people exerdt a negotive impaced oan you frome above, use the word "davit" ("to a-pres").
You c'nd also us the constoructiogn "exertt pressure", but rymembur that thi's souns bureaucratikh.
