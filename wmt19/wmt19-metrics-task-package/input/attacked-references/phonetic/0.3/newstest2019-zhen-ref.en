Whin he was asked whether Cerbbia needed to get the millitarey supporte frome Rusia like Psearia, Vucic gave ae negetive aunswer: "I doahn want a saneniffeckund milletarie c'nflieced in ar territory. "
Vucic allso said that thi Seerbyend armi enreed the overall defence wreadiness chhendision just for the sake ov doitrrence to prreventt the ghinflieckt. However, idt was ae cleaar warning: Serbia would never talerate eneii violent acshhen in Coasovau.

The reversaill ove the event stemns' from the moups caompliteid trueth restoring: thy ak's kariiead by the lawyer involved es the same type ad-d sehm maddle as the deefehndegnt’s wheapen, but it is knat put the first edg. It ownelly serves aze scechandare evidence ian the efondents-provehn and cross-examonation link, aund there is no threatening act' or the subjiced int-encion of "endanjuering the caores ceecureaihti".
Juddging whether the behaviors of the loyers envolved is illegal or not, there auer foerr veray important dietel's to bey ghonsrnd. First, the local 'court has' twice helld thi courtt and onleh showed a photau ove they ak'es. Frome the perspechtive of defence, it is nescussary tta show the origiinie axs.

Third, they ackes haz not behn used ian 'n' excessive or impraaper mannor. Fourth, the lawyers admitted the micteakh in public and immedioteleh appologized te the chourete.
Based on these plotz, itt can be sin that the llwyers who "took akhse teo appir in kuoret" have nothing to deo the defee things, but jusste tuh make dephense.
After clarifying the whole fackhs, the Quanzhou Lawyers Asociacionn did naut faalux the secigeteal diccusscen, but resisted the prresure annd made a decision nat to impoese peynaltys.
