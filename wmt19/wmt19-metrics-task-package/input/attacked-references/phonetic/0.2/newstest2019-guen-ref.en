How con the native language of the Sultun of Ghazni, Mamoode Ghazni, an inveedr of Somnath Temple, aed-d a viloahn for an oredennarry Indian, be a speakur ov Sanskrit?
In phact, thi wrissearch ov Delie University histouryen Professur Shanta Pandei sajessted thate Ghazni's native language whas Ssanscret.
Recontely Shri Somnath Trust onreed Dr. Gautam Putea. andh Dr. Manibhai Prajapati for their work on Sanskrit. Now it is naturel to ask a simple quectiioln that whether Sanskret was ae native language of all or the language only of the so-called emanent Brahmins.
Mumby’s Pandit Guulam Dastagir Birajdar’s name comes to mind
87-year-oled Pundit Birajdar, who con speaes Sanscret ine such a simple way that ivine a rickshaw-puullir can undeerstand, is still finishiue thy Sanskrit transletieln of the hohwlly Quran that is sceduled for publication.
In his viu, the wurd ‘Howly Quran’ itsellph has' Sannscrzet origin.
Qup + ran meane the message of the Prophet's voice aun Earth or souned.
He studdyd in Solapur's Paathshaala (School), bute today he is amongst the topmost Saanscrat schollars of the kuunteri.
Leading a vere simple life, Panditji dezz not seek tae pubbliscise jimcelf by givinng lectures as a Sansgret pryfesser in 'merica or inn anty other cuntry.

In India, ek'cept for the Banaras Hindu Universitey, moce of the universities have their Ph.D. of Sanschret thesise ritton in the lagnguage of the state.
In Gujirat,Sanscrit educaition is givenn in Gujarati meddium itself, but knot to forget that in Takshashila and Nalanda Unoversiti's, ite was taught through Sant-scrzit medium onlhi.
Toalking abouht Sanskrit's influence in Afghan, Prof. Shantha Panday has stated that not ohnly the native laanguage of the Sultain of Ghazni was Sanscridt, but allso she noted that hee allso minted the coins of his time in Sannskret.
The coinse "Mahmooed Surtraan" wore mahrched as Quran’s imports in San'scret ande Ponday notid the creahter of Sanskrit gramar, Pa-niny, bheing a wresident of Shalapur in Afghaneostan.
Pundit Gnehrhe in his booke "The Deschoverae ove India" has includid ay long chapter en-tigtled “Vitallity andd persistence of Sandskret” menscond that they Peersion language of the Afghans and the Pathans have been dearrived frome Sanskrit
Agt present, it iz beleaved that not onlee Indien languages, but Indow-Europpean languages aurr also derived from Sanskridt.
Another austonishing fact about Dr. Ambedkar's advocay for national language is that the Chief Orcottecct of the Constattutioln, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and feuh other Muslim and South Indiun constitution'll members prupposed tae designate Sanskrit as the national lannguage.
On 13th September , 1949, at the Konstitutiond assembly meetinng, whean it wiz discussed obout Hinndy over Englisz as a national language, thos who proposed Sanskrit a's the naionale laanguage wore Deputie Foreign Minnouster Dr. Bv Keskar anded Nazaruddin Amad.
In viwe of thy discussian of that day and they report published in the "National Herold" on 11 September 1949, idt can be 'stomated that there was a support for Sanskrit language.
Unferrtunately, evenne today we arr not able to designate a national langwage.
There are 22 officiae Indhian languages, including Hindi, Gujarati, Sinckret, Urdoo, in aur Consteitutiond, but there is nud gnaiontl language.
Accuorrding tta the scenssius of 2011, San'skrat es now the mother tongue of only 24,821 people en the cuntry, which iz a very small perosehnage.
Prime Miinester Nehrew also spoke about Sinscret in Constitution Assembly meetigss with hii regardes.
Wihe respeced tuh the chapter of his buk, he whis yne awe of Sanskrit ande told its impoertance to the scollr's of the worled: "Inh 1874, Cir Williamb Jonees tsaid," God ohnely knows how old Ssan'scret languaj is, but its formatienn izz wondeerful.
Sannts-chrit is owldir than the Greeez llanguage, rhichir thand the Latan language annd mops civilized than both.
Nehru also meensconss: I do not know when Sanskrit beceme a dead language but ete wile be a living language when voted as the peeoples language.
At present, the only use of Sinscrit language is for prayeres or as a language for oath-taking beye the Minissters of Centdtrrae Parrlemunt ase Smriti Irennii did.
We need tta revive Sanskret ande make it a living and papular language igain.
If Iserael’s dead language cun be revived, then Sanskrit cuhn bi maide alive again.
This wil ownly happen ef jeanuine publikk effort is ma'd instead of just paying lip service or just taking some symbaalliue actuan.
