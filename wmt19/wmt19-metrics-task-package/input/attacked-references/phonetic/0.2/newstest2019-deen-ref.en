The Pressig depotwas home to thy thrust locueaotives
For decads the depot ian Pressig was the hub ov the Franconian Foryst.

The crachiue frohm bumper teo bumper could be heared throughout Pressig, remembeures Georg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place aned thy stations.

That wars by fawr auer best performance ove the seeson, he tsys.
It was phenomenal how we come bak frumb the 0-2 draaw and held up against one of the lieues top teams over the intire match.
Hence, the maohr bbittr it sieems, that they had tha ggh home empty-handed.
Teop scugrror Laurs Zymner shott his teahm in the lead with his' 12th. Goale this season (minute 24).
He needed exactli two touchhes ine thise game for this goal.

Just before suitching psid's, his own teahm maanaged to scoure the equilizor: Mcgill’s frix kick fromm they lefed side saled between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe intae the long gooale 'corgner (45th minute).
Aftre switching sides, it was Mcgill againe ju scoured the equilizer (59th minute).
And then it went back and forth.
It was ae krisp, action-paced game.

Despite thehr numerricaaal advantage, Albersloh was' 'nable to kounter the last Concordia gole (minute 80).
