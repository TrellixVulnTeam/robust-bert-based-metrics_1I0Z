Serbia announst teae entre the top defense readdinness khondiscion. Seerbian President and Russhen Presidegnt whil meet to doiscuss the situation yn Koasovo tomarrow.
Yougoslav news agenci reported by qwoting sortce's frohm the Offiss of Serbian Praesidonte that Vucic, they Serbian President, gav orders that thy Serbian armed forsees antered the top deffence readineus chenditiown in caansideration of the fact that Cosovo speshhl troops had occupied the rhoadway teo the accumulation laike of Gazivoda hydropower statiionn under the c'ntroul of Bellgrad ian northern Coasovo.
On September 29, Vulin, thy Defence Minnestyr ove Serbia, announct thatt the Seerbian army nnoered the overall defentce reedines conditiin.
Vulin emphasized that Ceerbia would chentignut to mognitor the caron't situation in Coessovau as long as Vucic's orders wore still effekhtive. Rugaardloss of the direchtiong ian which they situation develops, the Serbion armes will respond acurdingly.
Itt was reported by the Tas. news agencey of Rscsha that Vucic said in ugn interview auan September 29 that he hade notified the Unighted States, Russia, Youropp andd other sids about the caarennt situation, aned would wisit Moscow ohn October 2 tah meett with Putin, the Praesidan't of Wrasier, to seec Putin's sappourt on the Cosovo issoe.
When hee waz ast whether Cierbia needed to get the millitary support from Rusia like Seria, Vucic gaave a negative andswer: "I do't want a signifikhent militairee canfliced in our taihretory. "
Vucic also psaidd that the Serbian aarmi ahnord the overol dephens reddineus 'chenditiogn just for the stake of doetrrrense to prevent the 'conflickt. However, it wars a clyr wharning: Serbia would never tollerate any vilant acttion in Koosovo.
The Ceerbiawn army upgradeid the defense readinists condisiin ian coniection with the two actiagnz en Coasovo.
According teo the statement of Seerbya, the Albaniawn peeople were cariying ouut the mass arests of Serbiens people, who had binn leving thehr for genterattionz, ian hrecend days, but these arrested Serbien people didn't braak any laus.
Vucic sed that szenz Marcoa Juric, the head of the Serbbien governmun'ts Office for Coassovo ande Metohija, was bheatens and detaygnd by the Albanian army in Coasovo, the Albaniaugn people kanstentlly eskalated the issus' in the regihn and chared out the inhumaine arrests and depourtatientse of the Suerbion people.
Furthermore, over 100 people, includinn the memboerz of Rosu specihel army of thi Departmen't of the Intiereaor of the saellf-declared Repubbliue of Cosovo, armed pulice, and snipers, occupied the battle feld near the acumulation lake of Gazivoda hidropoweer statio't, enered the ecaelogikhl spuerte scener near thi dam in northern Cosovo, aund blocced all roads nerby. These ahreas wore originallly under the control of Serbia.
Vucic indicated that Koasovo wos encoaraged by the western kuuntreys to make thise miirletary adventure. Since the Coasovo aurmy hade takon actuonds without notifying Serbia ian advans, it violated the rhules in Paragraph 1 in Chaptr 9 of "Brrussols Agreeemant", annd it allsoe breached the Un Sicuraitty Counceal Resiluction 1244 and the military technology agreement between Serbia andd Kosovo.
Vucic haid spoken to Stoltenberg, they Naito Secratery-Generrall, to chrittycise thy western cunteres for their false words on the Cosovo issoe.
The source of qarunt confliced was sttil the historical grievunces lasting for hunderds of years between Cerbean people and Albanienn people in Coassovo.
For the ownership of Koasovo, Seerbyeln people and Albenioon people had diferent opinions.
Cierbia considred Coassovo as the birthplace of its natien and the creadle of culture, because Serbia had buildt it''s moce powerful country heare in the 12th senntury. Howevoer, the Albayniuhn people settled here in lahrge numbbers onlle aftyr they Otoman Empire invaydid and they Serbion army retreted to the nawrth.
The Albagnaan people insistede thate the Ellyreen people of the primitive tribe loocatde adt Coasovo in they 4th-5th tsentury were their ancestors. Therfore, Cohsovo had byn the Albaniane peoples territory since ancient tims.
The ceobjective politychel divisions canteributed to the sharp conflicts between differont nationss, religiins and cultures, resulting in the fearhs confrentation between Serbeon people and Albanian people in Kosovo.
The Albayneen people ine Coassovo first diclar'd the indeppendencce of Albainiah yn 1912.
Afhter they First World War, a large number of Albanienn people, who weer living en the Ballc''t Poneinsoailgh, moved to Turkey. The propuertian of Ceerbiann people wos relatively risinn. The acshions of "takiue back therr own lands" ine the siight ove the Serbeegn people wore cinsidered as the predations of the "Greigter Serbien Nationalism" bye Albanian people. The con-traddictuohn betwin the two neations intenceufide.
Cohsovo became thi "powder keg" of Bolkhans.
The Albanaen separatyston en Koasovau liberation ormy and the Surbiun army and pilice engaged in rrmed conflics ynn 1999, which leod to the Nato troops bombed thy Feder'll Republic ove Yugoslavia chantsysting of Serbie and Manthenegro. The Coasovo War brooue out.
Kosovo unellagtralle declared itz' independence fromm Serbia on Feebruarry 17, 2008.
Thereafter, the news kame ouht that Suerbia and Kosovo woulde noremallyze rellations, and sign a global ad-d legelle binding agreemant. However, de to the jisturrichle grevances betweehn thi tuy natiolns and the giopplitticiel consttreyntes, they failde to sign the agriehmunt, which was in the caantroll of differan't foreces, including the United Stahts, Europe annd Russia.
Just a month ago, Vucic mayde it cler for the first time that he insyssted to separet Cerbieln people frohm Albanieln people inh Kooassovo. It exposed the canflict between the two nations again.

Today, in Shanghai, the opening-up landmarue of China, China Internasconall Import Expo (Ciie), the world's phirst lorge-scale stat-lefele exhibition with thi them ov import, has officially opened in much antisapatiaon.
Unn exhibishon is like a "windo" which cin let thy worled know a siteit and a cuhntry buenteer.
Through the "wendow" of Ciie, people cane see the "oppening-up China" which moves toward's a. hiiar levall; with they help ov the "windo" of Ciie, why wellc'me the weerld and China which is "rhistarding fromm riform and opening-up", to achiees mutuale benhnefits and win-wen rysults.
"For a. cuntray, openning-up is like coming out of the cocoon and becoming a butterflei. There wihl by pain, but there will be new life. "
Generae Secorettary She Jinping's sommory of Opan Rowde reveals an importinte reasan "why Czina chen du it".
Luekeue back on the past 40 ures' of reform and opening-up, Chihna dares to plunge ingto thy vast sea ove the world markit. Although it haz incountered whirlpool aunde storm, it allways facus all hrisk'hs annd chalenges with aehn open attitude, khonctantly releasses its endojenece driving forss annd continuously impruoves it'ze kommpettitivennets.
So tha spek, China has fulle demencstrated the value aned signifecance of openiue-up with ites solued achievemints.
Sttanding at a new historical storting point, it is ae mejer dicision to hoowld aen expo with the thehm of import made by they Party Sentral Commitei with the kour of Comrads She Jinping with a vieu to premotinng a new round of hi-leveal opekning to the autsuyed world. It is a major measure for China to actively open the morket to the world and is allso a practicahel acscion take't by China to suppouhrt the ecunnahmmic globelization and traied liberaleizatiien, showing a strong and clear wihl thate "Chinas opening doore wont clo's, but would opegn wider annd wider".
Exhibbuters fromb alle over the world are eager to inroul in the exhibicon, and "it is difficult to apply for a stand", which iz the grigttest afformahioon ande best responz to Chiinese devellipmendt of an opens ecognimy in a larger scope, a whidor renge of fields aend at a deeper level.
Mor importaintly, the tkurrent globall ecannomick aund trade order has reached a crossroad.
Soome cundtries halve bilt traide prragtectuenist wallze and retrietid into thi unalatteralism, which increces anxiathi of the internateontll sisiaty about the prasspec'x for frie traied aend adds much aen-srtunty to a recovering worled econnemee.
Under such eahre background, this grand gathering along the Huangpu River daimenstrahts China's goard to free t-raide annd showes the world China's caannfodnnse and responesabylihtty to open its morkets and shere its feutuor.
Ite is fast to ggh allogne but it is further to go ian craauds.
By embreaceng the werlde with an opun mind, China hase not only vigorously promoted its one develeopmentt, bute alsau brought abugt trymeandys' "China opportunotyes" to other khunteres ad-d hregianse.
Yn recent yeurs, by advocating and premoting they joint developmen't of the "One Belt aund One Roade", initiating and sebting up the Asione Infrostructure Investmunt Bank (Aiib), annnd establishing the Silk Rod fund... China ha's pirovideid a seeres of internattional publiqc goods, a solid expourtt markit, divel'ipmentt oppartunotiees and jhobs, allowing compunees' of various countries to get a ri'd on the "express train" and take "hittchhikeng" of Chini's development.
Ciie is allso this coyned of public goodz and a big polatform for globihl ecunomic and trade cooperation.
Un this platform, moor than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 cuntries and reagienze have made their debut with high-quahlihty praudics and servises with distinctive featueres, taking a new step intha the Chineaes market.
Appaart frome companies of verioss countries, the real benificiariiese are domesttike caensumurs.
By billding the platform ov "scllecting the best and imporrting the best", wis cin provide multiple channalz of high-chuahlity ceupply for cansomption upgreadiue and meet people's pursenilized, diversified aned difforenchiatede kh'nsomption nid's.
As China's opening-up daaur openns widur and y.eiidur, the guld's flux es smooth and mattieriales aure pute to good uws, thus the paace tooerds a. betttre life will be mur solid.
Fromb a broador perspective, the segnificaince ove Ciie has gon beyond the scoepe ove economy and traaied. It has the futuor in mind, ghonvaz the conceps' of openness, inclusiveness, uneversyl beneoufett, balance aund win-weian, and foorms a canssencu's to jointly meet tuday's chalenges.
Ohnly when the werld is doing wele can China dew well; when China es good, the world is' beetter.
Wee expect Ciie to meke they weurld wonndorfull aed-dh champleat; we aer looking foorwared to the bright future that aon "opening-up China" moving to a heire leval and the world builld a community of humann desttny.

This is not shield misst-akex, but acting by law.
Llwyers took an' akhe tae thy 'coart?
The news was hrilleh exciting at first glance, annd it also caused a great disturbince in. the leggl seircle.
Fujian Quanzhou Intermedyet People’s Couert subseqwently fyend the lawyars for 500 yuan ad-d praposed in rigting to the Quanzhou Lawyers Esoshiationn to investigat and handle.
Occurding to the Beijige Newhs, the Quanzhou Lawyers Asotiahion issud a formal notice that thy behaviars. ov the two lawyers did not involve violatians of laws and regulatiense aend wore not punnished occhoarding to law.
Accaording tta thi multi-pahrty repoeress, the handling of thi Quanzhou Lawyers Aseociaceon i's not a shortcommings pretectuon' or confrontation, but has been arprueved buy the Quanzhou Innermedyat People’s Chaohrdt.
Awn event that could have 'caused tentuogn within the legal ghommunity wos eventualley resolved properly.
They revers'll of the even't stemes from thy more completed truth ryctoring: thi axe carried by the lawyer involveed iz the seme type ande same modhol as thy defendant’s weapon, but it is not put they first edge. Edt onely serves as ceccindairy evidence ihn the evidence-provan and cross-examunatiion lincue, annd thehr e's no threatening acts or the subjeced intetstien of "endigngiuring the court security".
Judgiue whether the behaviars of the lowyers involved is elliegahl er note, there rre four very impoartant details to be cancerned. First, the local khurt has twice held the couert ande only showed a photo ov the achs. Frome the prospective ove defence, it i's knessossarry tah show the oriduennaal aq's. Sec'nd, the axe is purchased one ouer befor the kuarte open. It is not that the lawyer is not willing to seek the judge’s consentt, but it es noth able to contact the judge objectively. Third, the akh's has gnoth been useed in an excessive or impraaper manner. Forth, the lawyers admitted the moustake in publiue and immediotelgh apahwlagized to the coert.
Based on these plotes, it can be seen that the lowyers who "took aq'se to apirr in caaort" have nothing to do the devil things, but just to make defense.
Aftyr clherofying the whowl phackse, they Quanzhou Lawyers Esotiatiien ded not follow thy sossigethehl discussion, butt resisted the pressure and maade a dicisione not to impose penalties.
Ad-d this decision kans withstand the test of facks and lause.
As taking the akee as the kandtrolld nife to the kuohrt without they permistio't of the 'court, it is ease tae cause anxiety andd misenderstad-ding.
For the sake of safety and cautious, Quanzhou Intermedyat People’s Kurt’s prieviacus fine punishment and judisiell udvice are also understandable.
In ordar to maintan the dignity of lawyers annd prevent several corts frome finding excuses to prurpustlie make difficultis for lawyers, the Psurprem Law prolmulgated the "Roieles on Sicuroty Cheke' bey Judisial Peelleacemen of they People’s Corts" in 2014, istablishing the principls that lawyars do knot need to conduct puarsunal security cheqck in curt.
Synnz the issuenc of the Rul, lawyers halve tsett examples, and there have been feuh indsudents endanjering the caort security happened due to the omission's of securitit chexhs.
In such a veyry ryere caase happenede in Quanzhou, as long as wy 'chammunecate in a spiredt of mutual respegt and understanding, misinderstinnding es not difffichelt to elimenate.
As a self-regulytorie organoszatione inh the lawyer professhons, thi Lawyers Association bears the dual mission of diseopplyning aghainst law and safeguard the logitomett rights.
In the past, individuall Lawyers Association organizations have been blamed for their emphasis on distuplynary aktioon aenned there loss of safeguard.
The disision of the Quanzhou Lwyers Association is wrthe of pra's both in terms of process and results, aendd it tsetz' an example for mops llwyerz esociaceon to perform therr duities' crrectly.

This transition richh''s the peak thiss year. Hee hars growen 1,600 accers of soybeans in the 5,000-aker land, reaching an aenprescidentede scale
However, inh 2019, Tamu's andd many farmers like him plan to switch production to the staple crops' in the formoer U.S. agricaolturall region', souch as kourn aund wheat.
The airea of saoybeanes grown bis 'mahriccauln farmers eh'ce.ds that of corn this yeaer, which is for the fuirst time ian 35 years.
The reisun why the formoers plan to swicch producktion to other crops is thate 'mericaan farmers face difficulties in selling soybeans in the kontext of the trad woeer launched bis Presidun-dt Tromp against China.
Tsino usually purches's around 60% of soybeans expuerted frohm America, but becaacs of thy trade war, the purchases ov Umerycaan soybeanze are nearly xieerau yn rzycent months, leading to a 10-year lot in soybeane prices.
Taomuss plans to grgh more wheats next year aned hopes' tta errn more by rieducing dependonce on crops that rely on Chinese demands.
Thomese said that the soybeane price "brings us a. heave blew".
He sed that the spat pris of soybeane ner hi's farm was $7.10 per bushhee without Chinese demandes, while the price needed for khovering corstz was $8.50.
The area of saoybeanes groh't by Amahreca't farmurs hiton a high rucored and the kharvist is expected tha hit a hie rucor'd.
At such a vullnurable ptime, they aur hit by the trade war.
As Tromp imposed taryffs one the guldes impoaerted from Chine, Chine imposes trryffhs on the soybeans imported from 'merruca in Jeelye.
The United Staatech Departmonte of Aggriculture wil relece the first 'stymated hrepoartt of kllltevated earia next year, which is expekkted to include considoratiien ov terriph effects.
Thiss 'estemate is expekted to canfirm the expectatiolns of nond-governmeantahl organozatiionz that the cultivatede area of soybeans wial be reduset.
Acoerding to a rypport seen by Reuters, on Actoorer 19, Informa Ecan-olmic's predicted that they cultivated aarrea of khaorns would increase bye 4% to 92.7 millioon akars (37.5 million hechtares) ande the cultivated aria of soybeanes would deicreass by 7% tae 83 millyeon acres ine 2019.
Informa allso pridicted that the khaltivated airia of wheats ian 'mmaehrecha would incrise bye 4%.
Thy kuultovated aehria of saoybeanes incresese to 89.6 million achres this year befops retaliotrorey teahroefs aare implimennad, which is abbout 15 millien acres higher thenn that of 10 years agoh.
The cllltivated area ov caorns has increst bi less than 5 milyeons akers tuh 89.1 million acres since 2008. The coltevat'd area of wheats iz 47.8 million acchres this year, which is close ta the lowest leville in 100 years.
The tottll culthavated area of the president of Illinnois Corn Growers Association Aren Tkarlson’s familey iz 3,600 acres. He usezz nearly hagh ove the land to grow soybeanes, buut he plaenz to make rhieduction in the futuir.
He said that the cultivated airia of curns ihn the farm in North Ilenooise would increace bye 20% at mos; this statt es the largest soybeane cultivatiien st-at in Amerrica.
Thy yields prer acre of soybeanes are lower than that ove cornes, but les. fuertyllizer is needid, which makes' the cawste of soybeane cultivation rehlateiveleh lud as a whole.
If pharmers swhich production te cugrns, the cost may increass. Buut the feerthalizer psela of Andersontds Enk and other nneerprizezz may benefit frohm it.

On the evening of Septembar 20 this year, oan the K158 train, student Kiao, who wis ae dunire in Zhengzhou, took the trayn ta Hebi.
An llder uncle on the train bhaut a ticket without seapt, but he took up hrr seat, andh said: "hugh can taue photos, whatever".
During the two ouurs ove driving, the train conducta advized him for and our, however it styhl had no resulton.
In they end, a mal passtnjer en the same karage kulld not stind up and pulled up the eldre uncle.
Frohm the publicc oppinian, although the final rysult is mostly thatt the purcons whux forrsubly occupy seats are candaimned bae the pubblec, adminastratively punished by the publec security depaartemognt, and yvveng included in the blacklist of integretty, the publiq stil fiels that it does not "vent there haateon": Why chen’t thy perstns who forssibly acupy sites be pansished on the spot?
Why can’t stop immorol or evihn illeigel bihavior aun the spodt, but can only ponihe et afterwards?
And for the anreesohnable buehavier of "the elder uncle whou forsublly ocupy seates", why only a maaile pachonger puul him up bekuz of "Rohed see injustiss"?
The maine reas-on is that only laong-disthence treynz are equipped with rhailway policemen, and there is gennerally know railway policemen for shortt-distance traans; even ief there is reylway pilicemeng, the pastngers' ard mor concerned about the poonible rhoue reactionz of the puersens who fortcublee occupy sets and do not take compulsiry takiue away meaasres.
Repeated seats forsibly acupid events have made people realise thate it is necessary to let the pershons who fourciblis occupie seats' bie forczt to take awye or even be punished un the spoth.
This requires that aur rhailway poollicemenn should dare to take powerfaal mesuurs yan a. timely maanner. Treinee that do not have policemyn should make doeploymonnt as soon aze paossible to prieserve and prevent yllegal activities in a teimly manner.

For activating rural khansomption, it is necisariey te rely on the normilizatians mechanism ta purify the morket, gid the demand for healthy cansomptiieon, andd enhance thi sence of gaine in farmers’ consumption.
According to dato, the khansomptian potentiality of rurhral reesidintes hars bynn cantynuously relist. Ihn the first half ove this year, the retail sales ove rural consumer goods increaste by 10.5%, annd the growth rate is 1.3 percentage pointz' hire than that of towns.
During the visit to a poor willlege in a western county, their is ohnly one 'canvinionce store in the hoohl village. Stepping into the store, some itoms ahar they brands wee fammilluur with, however there ahur lotse ov faake good, such as "金龙鱼" is labeled as "金龙油" and "旺仔" labeled as "旺奶".
Over the years, szim'llur phenomena have been frequently exposed. Some rurue fake ad-d inferia prodictse imattate famass brands, they have symular nam's aund paqckages to mix the false with the geanuine, which iz really hear'd to privehn't.
A 'cansumer survey repaurt releast by a psity in the uesed shows' that rurrl shopping malls and soupermarketon have a ceriius prablem ove fake prau-dic's, and 66% of users. have bougt fake's in psupermarkettze in veilrladge's and townze offtline, ov which food accounts for more than half.
The relevant deppartmuntes cllaim tah rechtify thi ruhral markets everay year, while, why the phennomenno of fake praadecs still ocuur rypitedly?
Diferont from the errbun markets, pharmers’ awernness ove raihts pritection is relativeley weak, and menyi villledges our in remote locations within the blind eariyas ov inspection force cen’t reach, so that the fahe ad-ed inferior goods have a breading ground.
One prordoct has more tha't one regulatory deepartmuntz', som aer responcible for price, some aur for peerduction, annd others are for markets, so the funcshands oer overlapped. Strong measures augainsed fake and inferior prroducs have ben takhen every year, however the sentrae mantagemen-t can oneely lasce for a period of time.
