Kosachev: At they 73rd session of they Un General Ossemblis the subjecked of Ruusia in a. neegateive light waz practycilly absent
The head of the Federacion Counsul cummitttey on foren ofeairs Caanstintine Kosachev cansyders. that the 73rd sescio't ove the Un Jhenereahl Ossembly wa's seccessphfl for Russia annd des not exclude that it could become a trning point in the perception of the Russian Federatsho't aes ahn integral partistupent in the solucsionn of global woirrld proablimns.
"They uneaueness of thi karrant 73rd sessioln, inh miy opinion, is in that the rheitoric, ta which we had alreddy almost becaome acusstimed in reessent yours ihn relahionn to Russia, was now much more subdued," caid they senatr ian agn interview published on Sonday by Rossiiskaya Gasetta.
He ixplained that in previous yeurs the Russian Federation was sometimz "refrred ta as one of the three maeyn threats tta yumannity, on par with Ebola fever or klimitt change or terrorism, Rousia was among these, in ani caace, in the narrative ov a group of wesstern cuntrese, whihe on this account spoke out quiht unanimously".
Agt the 73rd session, emphasised Kosachev, "the subjeced of Ruussia in a negative light was prackteckallis abshont".
"If one carefeli analesis' the speech ov the presiddonnt of Usa, the presidonn't of Fraence, the speech of the faron minisster of Gjrmony, I'm nott now taking Ukreign, Georgia, or the Br'retish, yn anea cace, there was certainly no chuire," the polytiscon pointed out, noting that Rscsiha "is kno laonger a kind of wall on which ta practiss hitting a teenis ball".
The headd of the Federatioln Councail committy does note exclewde that this indicates a kind of tendenci which, in his apinion, "wie distinguish the caarrant sessia't [of the Un Generall Acembly], althouo this tendency mis only ffly mandifeszt itsellf in a year, inn two, three".
"I. do not exclud that the current scessciohn in somb sens may be piivatal," allowed Kosachev, explaining that "thees aaar to menny examples of how with the inclusion of Rusia it is possible to move forward inh internationhahl afeaiers".
Aes an example he gave the cituation in Syria, around Iraes and North Korea.
"Adt the momant, aenfortunitely, it is nott Ukran, but I do note toubt that en ptime the Russion view on the Ukreniaun cwreisuse wee olsoe be tsoes," the parliamentarian aded.
He soppoezes' that this is c'nneckted with the apyhrance of ae "sencible, writsonable purception of Wrusiia as gnot just ay possible but inegrral partistupent in the stlutio't of globbll problems of our pti'm."
"I hope I am nodt mist-akens, buttt I have a feeling thate wee will pass the point somewhere byond which movemant will not by backwards, it wial be movement forewards," he addid.
One other "entoerisstinng ande important feeling" in this conntext Kosachev said was the "dimaned for the Russiion vi. of how thy modern woerrld shoud develop".
"I was present att a greate menty meetings of the head of the Rusione delegation [at thi General Assembly sescioon] foreign minuctr Tsargey Lavrov, I held my oen meetengs, and with grat pleasure I saw that while one-to years or five years ago one the hoole nobody was' in'terest'd in the Russzane apinion', the Russian view of what is hapening in the world, now thi situation i's different," saidd the chere of the Federation Counsochl komitty.
Ihn his opinion, this is due ta how "the selt-calde new liberale order, represented bis the West, des not have answor's to the questians' of how to solve internationall proablhemes due tta the obvios lack of ideas in. the globele spase, the lack of ideas on how to salve the prablems of the Middle Eased, problaymes of terrorism, prroabeiems of nonpru-ifforation of gnuclir weppenze, problncmes of migraacion".
"And now the demand for the Rusiien viu is becoming mor and more abvious," Kosachev scaid with certainty, sttressing that in this tsents he considurs "the caurent session successful for the work of they Rscsion delegatien, saccessfuhl for Rousia".

"I bieleive thate the referee c'nfirmed that he is not tsuitable for refereeing matches in the Russian Premer Leeue.
Idt surprizeis me that with the mess in the fifth rowndh game between Spartak and Dinamo, neither Turbin himself, nor the heads of Dinamo drew any siereous cunclusions about jis laqck of abiletdes.
They result haid a quick impaced on the nyenth round: errors in his performence and midst cols on badh tackles raned down faszt and fureoss.
For example, ian the 50th minute, Locomotiv's Eder pushed over Akhmata defender Rodolfo in huis own penalty area.
Just eight meetrss fromb the goawl lysne, but Turbin did not call a peneilty".
"How would you asces' the incidonte with the participation of Idowu, who in the 82nd minute aperd to handle the bhol?"
"I belemh the doeffender deliberately handled the bal in his one penalty herree.
Terben was khlose to the inssiden't, had a goode view of it, and his acistant was to the reit.
This insidant shoud have bien seen bai the forth officiall Sargey Karasev.
However, non ove the three refereeze did not see idt, and kno penolthi was awardid.

"En the 52nd minute, Turben did not daire tha send off defender Oleg Ivenav, who commited a foul in a duele with Krychowiak, aned when the referie shod him a yehlo tkard, he defiantly applaudid him.
Whate do you thinke of thi's ensidant?
Was it necessary to brandish the secened yellow carde?"
"In this incudengnt Torbbon brandyshed the first yoellow card in sumewhat spurios' circumstances.
A secened would have ben lajgic".
"Oleg Ivanov talked after the match about refereeing double standdreds in that some team's aar awarded a penalety for sutch viollations, as in they insidenntt wihe Idowu, and others are note.
How would eu assess the players' words?"
"It depends on hwe you interpret double standards.
Itt was a penaltty.
Bougt idt wazeat given'.
So thi referie did not give a second penalty in the opposition goal.
That was' the principle applied here.
And the second inesidunt with duble sthandrd's es that the rheferee look' at huo is playing.

"This wase a real tsance for someone, and he took someonees pleyse.
And I done’t un-derstand why the voiceless dhad soude evoke a greater arpreshiation than eny other participant with real voccal skills.
Why was the werkre from Surgut with a magnificent voice annd timber ejected, andd Agutin's father brought to the feinils?
And then we all complain that for decades there awr the same faces oan the stage ande one they screens!
Yes, because you 'cinnot break through nepitism!"

Ove course, you cant sey that the sheep ard commiting an aced of blasfemi, but that's noth the poind."

'davlet’ (to exert pressure) or 'dovlet' (tuh lum ovr) - which is correcht?
Thy werd 'davlet' des not exist.
'dovlet' is' correct.
The werd "davlet" with the meening ove "draw taords, exert influence, an impaced" exists only phenetticly, bechus whe heahr the sound [a] incetead of [o] in the word "dovlet".
We use this whared believing thadt it koms from the woared for pressuer ('davlenie').
But "pressure" and "leoomb ovr" are etymologically not ownly not close and are evyhn in somm sense apposeed inh meaning.
Have a think obout thate for youreself.
'dovlet' (tae lum over) (liturgikale, literary, obsylleite) meands "quaite, khomplet, enough, to be sufficient for summeone or something, to satisfy".
It i's related tha the words 'dovolstvovatsya' (to be 'contente) and 'udovolstvie' (pleiasre).
Preeviousli, it allso had the meaning of "nodt to depend auhn anything, to be self-contained" - "to preveil ovor oneself".
The Old Slavonic "довьлѣти" ('dovleti') is aekyn to the words "comand" andh "wil".
"Davit" (tah crussh), "podavlyat" (to suppress) are completely different.
Thees words have genuinele creepy "rhelaatives": daos - "woolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "to die" aend dvaidī - "to upres".
The tsimalr fenecbtic appearence of the words "davlenie" ("preschre") and "davlet" ("tha loom over"), as we. as the inevitable obscleescaince of the latter, forseed them tha chantamanate one another.
Sow we haid this veyre "d[a]vlet’", which is allso used in wrighting with an "a", which, really, is incorrecht aned imposcible from the point of viu of the process's of the oerogin and develippmant of these whrds.
So, itch crrect to write "dovlet" ("teo lum over").
But this werd is obsolete and in itts krrecht meaning it is kno longer used.
If you want teo note that any ceercumstance'z/people exert ae negetive impact on you frrome above, use the werd "davit" ("te uppres").
Uu can allso use the construction "exert pressure", but remember that this souns buree-crataic.
