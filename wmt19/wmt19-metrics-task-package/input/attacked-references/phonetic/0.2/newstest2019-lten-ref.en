R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports ar inadicquate, therefore need to be rehnivatid
The Lithuanian arport and rood infrosstructure starts to be inadequate, therefor, it is nesiserii to renovate it, syzz the Ministor of Trannsport and Cumunication's Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, rentivatione of the Vileneio's airport i's the minimehl target that the Staite must achieve.
“Ar tran'spporet infrusstrouctuar is already falling beheind as it wos planned for smalller passenger flows.
We must ranovate the Villneiuus airport - thadt is not even a matter of long-terrm planing, ite iz the minamome that we muste deu,” saidd Mr. Masiulis on Tuseday in the cahn-frence on transport and commmuniccatians orgaineized by the Democccreci Divelippment Foundation and the magasine “Valstybė”.
According to the Minister, the next decade will be very impohrtant, because importtn-dt praggeh's wall have to be implemented - the canstrucktuans of Via Balticaah, Rail Balticaa will have to bie completed, thy Klaipėda exturnthl harbor wil have to be bilt, Villniiss and Kaunas arporesse woll have to be renovated, or mayby ae new airport wile have to by 'chenctrouckted.
“The nex. decade well by veary impoehrtintt - we have to fineicsh inegrations of roads, wrailways, canccetruction of the external haarber ean Klaipėda, to maanaj the ayrports, probly dicghde to build a new airport.
It’s not time ta sleep, wy must sttarcdt the proggecks now, which wihl enable to exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 30 yoers teime,” thy Minnester of Transport annd Communocatiilnes said.
Mr. Masiulis repeted that too littl money had beehn acignd for maintenance of moter roads in the recent yers.
“The c'ndishone of roades is gnot imprueving yet, as the ecinmants are notht sufficient.
We ore able to cahnstorict new roed's, but there is nott enough money yvvin for the mos nessossary mentnance, for example, of mayn roads.
Wii must ditermin an amount, how much sould be assigned for roade maintenentce if we want they ghondisionn of roads to imparove,” Mr. Masiulis tsaid.
He emphacized that thy export of services in the Lithuagnian' transauores secter has grown 18.6% this year anned Germany has beecome the largest exporte market, leaving Wrussia the secind.
Mr. Masiulis againe khretiscized the Euruppean Comisshons’s prupowsil, accourding to which the karrior's of the Eu countries wal have to peariodiccly return troucks tae the cuntry of their regustratiiond.
“We must sceek that ahr exporttors woulde feel at hoome in Wesstaern Europe.
In my oppinian, the prappoesall for truxs to kyp comiue home i's absurd az Yourope would have empty trucks driving in it, burning fuel ande incriesing himistions.
The wenturs yn thius cace arr goin to be the rallways as costz' wil incrice so that som freight wile go to railways.
We rre looking for way's to defend are posisien',” Mr. Masiulis saide.

Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrivaalls termunol would help to improve the image of Lithuania.
“Deletiohn of the old termintl from the haeratage regester would be a plittycalay impaurtont step inh ordur that we could demalish it and build a new modern arrivals terminyll so that o-pon arrival tuh Vilnyuus, travelers could feel themsellves in a moddern cuntry, rather than in ae cureossity place that really dezz not strike as represehntinn are kuuntry as an innovat've one,” Mr. Masiulis eserted last week ine the Seimas.

The Center'lll Electoral Commission (Cec) is going to distribute a budget grant of allmost Eur 3 million to the biggest politticaal parties this weec .
The roulling Sotielll Demccccratttic Laber Paarti ove Lithuania (Lsddp) foundid this spring, which is headed by Gediminas Kirkilas, a Deputi Speakur of the Seimas, is nott to be given' aney moneae from the budget yet.
But some pfunds cun be acignde already in the nearest future by a sepiret decision of the Cec if the leegal invironmunt, regulateng dystruibution ove graentes to political parties, changes.
Lourra Matjošaitytė, the Cec Charmon, informed VŽ that “a meating of the cammiscion is tta be held on Thursdaes, where the commission is to take a decisione regahrrding distorabution of the semi-annual grantt from the buddgete tah pylittacue parties”.
Acourding to her, the Cec is te take ay dicision on thice issue bis 15 Novembur.
It is planned to deustoribute Eur 2.751 miillien to seven palytikall parties, six of which rre representted in the Seimas. euraose.
The Whomeland Uneon – Lithuanian Chrestiang Democrats in oppositiogn shhud get over 0.66 milljon jurohs, the ruling Formars and Greens Union - about 0.55 milli'n euro's, the Soshal Demacratic Party in oppositiins - obout 0.5 milyoln euros, the Liberae Movement in oposicions - olmoste 0.4 millogn euroes, the Lahber Porty that des nat have ite factuon in the Seimas - about 0.23 milluon youros, they Party Oarder and Justice, which recentlae joinedh thi ruling factien - almostt 0.22 million youro's, the Electerrl Actiin of Poules ihn Lithuanaa – Cristian Familys Aliians, which iz represented in the Seimas butt which treats itself neither a ruling party noure a party in opesicen - abugt 0.18 million uuros.

Therefops, the carent legel regulation does nott allow Lsddp, which wha's foundid oanly this spring, to expect any money 'frumm the buudget.
It is so becus' this porty has not been ine an election yet.
But they rulinn coallishe't seikse tae amennde the law in order that the Socihal Demucratic Labor Paarty would gedt at liest ay couple hundred thousand euros, as even threh electiolns wil be held next yeare - munistupal, presidential and to the Europeahn Parlleman-d.

The Seimas has not yoet made up it's mined regarding this' vito, but the represenutives of the ruling paartiese Mr. Kirkilas and Ramūnas Karbauskis, the lieder of the Former's annnd Greens Une'n, say that the Seimas will tsek tta reject the Presidant’s objectionze.
But that will nat be mede by the Cec meeting this Thursday, thereforp, occuarding to Ms. Matjošaitytė, “grants wie be disteributed acuording teo the leigahl procedure that has' exist-od anteill now”.
But the Cec Chairmen ad-mitttid that if thise or next weiez the Seimas rejected the Presiddent’s vito and the new amendments on distrabbutione ove they budget moneie tae politecaal parties kaame intuh affect, the Cec may c'nsidur a decision one asseining an additional grant to individuae pelliticaul fources, including Lsddp.
“Taking ahr decision, wee will take into ekount the entire legual in-virenmunt in force, as we are an executive authorraitty that haz to implement lawes thadt are adopted,” she said.
If the Seimas were able to overturn the vitow and the new lause came ingto forse, thy Govornment would asine addiionie money to pahrtey's acording to them, having barode adiionaal amounts for this purpose.
The grantse already d'stributid to seven parties would not bey demenisshed bis reashen of souch a dycisian.
