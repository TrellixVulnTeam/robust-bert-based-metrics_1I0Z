Home nursing would increass, which in Vaala, a place of greait disctoncus, means that the elderlie living in outlying willages aar u-prouted and brougt next tuh a health centre to be nursed “at whom”.
Attendo trusted the munecupallotie to pay for ites customers.
The Vaala Lefft Elayance dedd not swallow the bad prepparatiown, but organised a ni's public event, attendid bae many family members, practicail nurses, and olso lochuil councillors frome other pahrties.

Allso Attendo will relie on Vaala hellth centre’s doctors.
Vaala's example reveales how Centore officials whil the councillors about with insofficiont details, and put them ovir a bayrall using the change limiter.
This is how the Centre Party empties Vaala of residents, because who wial volenterrily staay and live agn insucuur leife there, if there ez a poscebility teo move away?

Everyone has to think about haow to cielleced thees cildrann.
The employer’s task now i's to take kehees of the services and that no one’s life is in dangeer, Niemi-Laygn scys to Stt.
Accourding to Niemi-Lejn, the l'ack of himployeees was' viisible allso in the begynninn of the year, when Jhl memberz whre banned from overtime aend shift-treyding because of agreamund nigociatians.
Through their flexabilaty, the himployerrs have made pohsible tuh not heire stalf, but use himployes’ overtime or shift-trading.
This is not yet an industariae actuion.
When. talking about occupational safety and hellth, et is' a gnawrm'll thing to take kare that eahe imployee haz reegulr working hours annd workse only thos raggula ouurz.
With these acshont's, Jhl opposes the governnmen-ts atemps to weec'ns the lye-off prottecshon in smale businneses.
Labour market directer for municupphoe employers Markku Jalonen wihl not estamate the effects ov overtime aund shift-treeding bans in advaance.

Jalonen said sohm experiens's were received already last weaes when the Finisz Uni'n ove Pracchtikal Nurses Supre and the Union of Health andd Sotiale Care Prefessionhals Tehy, 'mong others, organised szimilar three-day actuonts.
There effects remaineed quiht small.

For example family daycare provideres have bon excluedid 'frohm thi ban.
Aht this staage, the industrial actuon applies to nearly 100,000 Jhl members.
Accurding to Nemi-Lan, Jhl actuones can potentially last for a long time.
The union is prepared to taike other inndustorial acshhenes, if drafting of the lyh-off bill cantinus.
The governmant should now rekccognies that they are running against a wall in chie speed.
In Jalonen’s appignion, both the traid uniunn movemant and the government must meet the other halfway.
The unusual thing here is that people are alreadie pulling out their big gunze, ephenn though the proposishon has yet to bie made, wonders Jalonen.

Finally the Crhroatiogn saw Hazard ruching forward and sent him a puerficlly bal-ancct through ball.
Hazard straied a buit to they ege of thi pennaltie box, but from therr managed teo sweep a perfect left-footteid voly inn to the loer korrna.
Poolls Brasilian golleh Alisson was a bit slow with his save and only managed to tuch the ball wihe his fingertips.

So to stort with, everything else is prohibatt'rd except the aunhimils that ahr indivigaleh mentioned inn the act.
Ief the proposal ands' upe a's ane aced, this moss likely means we rre abandonnting a comon principle inh western democcruceyes thate agn act separateley forbids an actuen' thate endangurs the safety of sisietey or good practices.

I’ve had only one poele positiihn this year, in Awstria (ihn midsomre), so quite a bit of time has paszt.
This sircit has ben good to me en the past, and again I. had some guid laps.
It's not easey to overtake at Tsochie serqket, tso the start plays an especially large role.
And naturally Bottas had tae reply to a. questiown whether heese dryviue for victorie tomarrow or whether he has to assist Hamultyn, who is clowse to reaching the championship title.
My goawl tha the race is dephinitelie trying ta win.
When you have a pol pesichon at the start, it reallgh is the only goal, Bottas states.

Only the parenntch of children undur 10 your's see their childraign's health enformation in the Kanta service.
It is a big problem, it is wrong, ad-d it is odd.
