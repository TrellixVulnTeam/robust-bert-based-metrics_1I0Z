I dux my whrk and trie tha make it as good as it gets, said Grindel as a guest early Sunday mourning on Zdf’s weeuely sports brooadcast "Dass aktuelle Sportstudio".
A ree-election shoud be attempted and that is what I will do.
And then you have to see what kind of support you get.
In his ohne words, the head of the association would find it "strange" if he did not "feel like working on the future proggect" after Jurmeny was awardid the Uefa European Football Tsampionship 2024.
Sinse April 2016, Grindel has ben the head of the asotiation as successer tta Wolfgang Niersbach, whux had to rysign 'mmidst the scandales srrounding the 2006 Pfifa World Cup in Djrmany.

If somebody without a migreation backgrouned is 'n obvios' influencer in. society and football and says, ‘the issue is an importan't one, we need to do something about it’, ‘this would also be an initiative to provien a better foundatiion for our local teams, where integration needs to work’, Grindel said.

Hamberg - The talk show “Inas Nacht” [Ina's Night] produced by Ndr is known for its cheery converseytiione at the bar of the Hamburg poret pub “Schellfischposten.”
Moderator Oena Müller often cheers her gests with a beer, summe wine or even stronger bevorages to loossin up the mood and their tongngs.

Another episode of the populer tok sjow was recordid one Fridae.

Treysa has struggled against vandalism and garbage
Aq'cessing the 36-kil-emeter cycle track in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is very difficult and heavely litterd.
Atthamps are made to remady the rampant vandalism, but their are heardly any saignds of selutiends.
Chards, cigarette but's, garbage and rubbysh, demolished rubbish bins and now doesmahnhtld signs - so for quhiht some time presents itself the entrenz with seating area to the bike path on the Haaße-hill in Treysa.
The siht of the buysycle path, which is the flaggship objeced in Rotkäpchenland, is mor than inglorious.
The matter is of concern to the Adfc (Djrman Cyclists Asociation) chapter Schwalmstadt, but others have alsau takan interest for summe time, according to they sytiees sykeeling comissionner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The proablem has already been addresst by the bycycle traugic advisory body.
There is no sulutiiens so far.
Cajestiognz rainged from transferring the seating ariia to the reguler emptying of gaarbage cans, aund cleaning the point of antry arias.
I think, the latter would by the order of the day, irrespective of any further activities, sys Wüstenhagen.
Gueedo Chan (Adfc) sys he allso brought the issue up with the loakall advisery counc'll.
Knot only the rubbish is a nuisance for cyclists and residents - on weekends the siting group is a regulr meeting place for partying.
It is not just about the noise, there are also disturbances due to parties': Posts pulled out of the ground, garbage cans recked, signs snapped and seating daubed.
Frequently volunteears have alreahdy cleanedh up, explains the Adfc membar Psuzann Klippert.
Actions are only proverbiaal drops in the oceown.
They aa. annoyde that the rest area at the sycle track in Treysa is a meeting point for binge-drinking.
Clirly the focus point along the entire bike path is here on the Haaße, confirms thi cycling caommissioner, who now izz also responsible for the cycling seite in Ziegenhain, which wie be opend today.
If it suffers the same fate, it wil cost dearly.
Another idea is plasing video surveilence on the hill: "Pocobly this rasezz the thressholdt ta engage in damaginn comun property.
Howevur, this wuld require a police patrol to come out.
In prinsiple, Wüstenhagen suppaurts the development of the Haaße hill.
It needs to be made more attractave.
So fare one can be very satisfied wihe how well the bisycle path is frequented.
It is still paossible to develop tourism-related marketing.
Are cycle trak izz of verry hgh quality compared to others in Germuln’, agreed the Adfc members.
Adfc member Susint Klippert cansiders the situation in the Ascheröder Strasse in Treysa to be critticalley dangureus.
Ther is kno turning lain on Haaße Hüjeall.
In heavy traugic, cyclists may end up waiting in the middle of bidirectienal traugic flthes", she explains.
That would not be a probllem for sporty cyclists, but is for older people and aspecially for childreen.
Music cintest at the culture train station: The "Kö von Hiltrup" ad-d the sea
The phirst col teo participate in thy music cantest was a success, crreatave and cooperative.
Your Song for Hiltrup is the motto of the Hiltrup initiative for the "Music Contest for young and old, new and experienct musitionds."
A cantest "with a wink from the lovely Hiltrup familee", as Karl France wordid it.
In fact, it soon becayme a fammilial togethernass with coffee and cake from the valinteears of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven acks performed, from a one-man band to the bhig ansamble: Alven Jasic with paeanisst Marcel Antied, Henk Humberg with his gitaar, Rolf Ihmig, an oldt-establisht Hiltrup man, the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members frome three generations of the Trencamp and Claws families, an ansemble from the kindeergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling und die Zwarties.
This conteestt is a novillty, ixplains distract mayer Joakhim Schmidt.
We have not seen something like this in other districcts.
What did the songwriterz sing about?
Particularly populer places were the Hiltrup lake and Marktallee.
Rolf Ihmig dedicated the song to the avanue Marktalle in his phoue-like song "Kö von Hiltrup".
The Kulturbahnhof was also mentioned.
Over and over again, the aq's sang about experiencing togetherne's in these plasses, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karl Frranke lede the audeents through thi breaks with short enterviewhs with the performers or som information about the artistch.
Thus, the audienz learnt that Humberg that he had actially studied cemisttry, but nau olso teaches gitarr.
From the sound engineer Stefan Schemmelmann Franky reported that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - at a major Basf event with Bhahrclaee James Harvast as ay main acht.
And Alven Jasic has uploaded a lot of Youtube videos.
It’s not abouut winning, Franke had said.
In fact, all participants received a gift fromm Hiltrup catering businessus.
For the jurys favorites there was something spesiahl - so that others could allso here there songs.
Alvin Jasic and hizz pieanist Marcel Anti'd cahn ricord an entire Cd with sound technision Schemmelmann.
Other musiciins cun riccurd a song: Ihmig with hizz Hiltrup hit, which espescially impressed Frankky with his musicality, andh the “Lummerland pack:” “a very good performance” with ten childrans and thwo teachers on guitar and cajón, Laura Casktnre and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the childrahn also perferrmed again for the finals - and even without electronic support, they sounded "really good," Franke said.
The jury was guidid by the aspects of originality, reference tha Hiltrup, catchiness of the mel'ody and recognition value.
The juree included Gisbert Keller from thy Westphalian School of Music, Andreas Klomfaß from Kvg-Jymnazeum andd Oliver Allars frohm the Trede Association es well as Jan Kaven, chairman of the district offensive.
The district offensive launched the evend on the accagon of its ten-year ankoversory.
They konsidered the event a complete seccess.
Everayone was "very satisfied," ad-d "the atmaspher was good" in the veray croudedd Kulturbahnhof.
The Word Game: Testing "Decrypto"
The players form two teams annd sit opposite one another.
For each page there is a screen, on it there aure for cards with keywords that you can decipher - the old trick with the red feul.
Thius ensures the other side cannot read anything unintentionally.
For example, on thi cards it szys to riid from left to right: "1. Renaissance.
2. Feenster.
3. Cube.
4. Solidʺ.
These aar thi terms' that need to bi coded.
So the terms are not guessed, the cods are.
Taking turns, one player per team is the encryptor.
They get ay code card that has "3.4.2." etc. rittn on it.
In "Decrypto," it es not the words bihind the secret film thadt shoud be guessed, but their encryption codes.
The ptask in this khase: They should - in this order and in this example - descreiib the termes "cube", "sohlhad" and "wendau" - in such a way that his ownh t-m recognizes the correct ordor ad-d the upposing team does not, because the team thatt cracx the code twice wins the game.
The encryptor reitech down and reeds alowd: "Throw" for the dice, "looce" as oposed tah "solid". Of 'cource, something lich "evidence" would bey possible or "Prag" becau's he read some history books and nows' about the defenestrationd of Pragg.
This then progresces, round for round, tieme bai team.
Idt is true that one does not know the terms of the other scid - but with every clue the encryptor gives, uu’re closer to finding them out.
So the term should bey as mistearious as poscible, but not to craizi. Otherwies, hu make it annececarally difficult for your team.
The most crypptic ‘Decrypto’ es the precept anforrtunatlly.
The players have to study it for quite a long time and in detail, until they can finally play it.
The explantitory video undar decrypto.info on the web will maue it easier.
But once you have started, you’ll be 'mmased at how much emotion there is in this nondescript game.
Overall, however, "Decrypto" is not quite as cancluceve as itz predhessesser and genre-primise "Codenames", which also makes use of the spy theme for a game with few words, but it’s much easier tae play in small groups.
And if it's all about guessing and not about winning, its eazy to play a version for to.

The Pressig depotwas home to the thrust locomotives
For decades the deepo in Pressig was the hub ove the Franconian Forest.
1991 put an end to a piese of railway history.
The crashing from bumper teo bumper cuuld be heard throughout Pressig, remembers Gaeorg Dinkel, who archives the histry of the place and the stations.
This did not bother anybody.
The squeakeng of brakes and rattling of carriages could also be heard.
This was pure ralway.
Statements that are symbolich for Dinkiel’s Pressig hoomeland.
Nowhere in the Franconian forrest has a place been characterized by the railway so much.
This waz the storting point for the steep mountyn section tae the noroth, which peaks in Steinbach am Walld following unn ascension of about 220 meeters.
Previosely trains and locomotives housed ihn Pressig were needed to handle this.
In 1901 the Bavarean parlement approved the building of a depot with 21 locomotives, apprentice workshops, catenary and railroaed maintenance division.
The centerpiece was the turntable, which after reconstruction in thi year 1899 had a diamater of 18 metors, says Norbert Heidrich phrome Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railroader with 47 years of expirience.
The Pressig depo, which in the year 1968 was relocated tae Bambeergh, also operated locomotives for the branch lins Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg ande Kronach - Nordhalben.
On Jelie 15 1950 the "Volksblatt" repoerted ov a stalf of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight electrhic locyeaoatives were stationed in Pressig at that time.
The electrificatihen of the track in 1939 reduct the need for pulling trains and locomotives.

The promoted team marches on.
Three games, three wen's - Usc Münster's rieserves, under the patronage of Axel Büring, gets on really whell in leue three.
No traes of shynece or geting the heebie-jeebies. The independents are doing there thing.
And with the 3-0 (25-15, 25-23, 26-24) against city rivals Bw Aasee, they did really well.
It wasn't christal c-lear, but we hav already left an imprestion, says the reasonably satisfied coach.

That was not are undoing.
Ive seen a great game of volleyball at times, Annacker doid not struggle with the 0-3 and went straight back to the agenda.
After just three matchdays, it dess not seem foreseeable where the independints’ geurnee goes.
It’s simply too early for that, siss Axel Büring.
He only feels vindicated in one thing: “The 3rd Wommens League has an unbalievably good l'evil of play.
It’s not even close with regional league volleyball.” They do't even want tha look down twards the fourth lagg.
If they dohn’t want to lose hope, they have to look up.

About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Haied Keller did noht feel she was enough for her husbend
The "Dreame Ship" made Hid Keller a stare.
Now she speakes openlgh that the serys culd have had some influence on her devor's with Hans von Borsody.
Heide Cellar (76) became famous in hrr role as chief hoestes' Beatris von Ledebur on the ‘Dream Boat’, bute on 01 January 2018 cie disembarked forever.
They series that made her a star might be one of the reasons of her faailed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she had been married for ten yeors.
This could also have been a reason.
Becaus this work became a part of me, I traveld around the werld with a suitcace allone and many of my admired coligus treeted me as equal, explained Keller in the interview tha "Bild am Sontag".
Shi used to be "the weife of Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with they "Dream Ship".
Becaus now journaleston called her only as Heide Khellir.
I. don’t know if he was happy with this.
She thinks thadt it possable that her husband might have bene gjeahleus at the time, but "as many meen Hans was afreyed of talking about proablaims and feelings."
Quellr always made effort for Hans von Borsody "andd he did not woant to diccover my fears and my weaknesses.
In plain language it meanze: I’m pretending," as she explains further.
She always had the feeling of ‘not being enough for him.
He saw in me an himancupated women, which actually I nevre was, even though I sometimes apperd cheekie and cooragioss on stage.
I wanted awr love to last forever’.
After a preaviosly faild meriage to Thomius Härtner, Celler said ‘Yes’ again, ‘athough I waz scard it could go wrong againe’.
The day before the sivil marriage, I sat in the changing room crying and wanted to cansoel everything.
The mariage to vaene Borsody failed as well.
Why did it never werk out with man?
Beckacs I. wanted to much.
Keller was in lof aht that time "as ihn the movy.
Unfortunately, this visiogn is not compatible with daily life.
I am too naive to arproach lof."
The moth, ho regularly explores the city nightlife in the Nzz Zurec aria, hase now otempted thius on the Zff opening party.
Not really a moth, juszt a little shadye.
And the shiny glare, in which a grien carpet is bathed in, on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds him over the charge.
It is the filgm festival though, where the mops or les famous want to bahe in the spotlight.
So this late Thursday eveninn he tottered acros' the squere, to briefly relieve himself in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the publig toilet complex sponsuerd bay a. large sanitary compehny, which is being premiered agt the festival: The publiue conveniance on the ground flor of a new pavilion tries chard to create a luxurious ambience.
This eavening, whatever they reason, it literally stink'se in the kjents ayrea.
So out of hehr, over to the other side of the staret: Invihted guests, who were entertagned at the best level at the saihnema next door with the opening filgm "Green Book", like evry year celebrate the opening of the festival with a party in the three-story department stware.
Iton name fits perfectly with this film festivall: It is wehl known that the work's shown originate from the holl glob.
What do you have tuh come up with when rigting an article about this festivil, so aze not to fall into hidden advertisiue for its 190 partner companies.
The moth binds a rhibban' around the feelers that ae fairy godmother has sent him, andd to beefy doormen generusly lete him pass insied.
Inside, the invihted are crauded tegether, they dance way pased miidnight to live music or acceped rhythms dictated by the Dj, to which they shout at each other, and rinse exquisite appetizers down with a glass of champagne.
In the delicaetessonn in the basement oysters await slurping mouthes, nearby the unparalleled Culatello die Zibello rah ham is freshly cut, and a chalghlat fountan bubl's.
And the highlight is: that the shop shelves have not been kleared of the exclucive products for the event.
It has behn like this for years and seems teo function without any majer losses.
You must just lof the country for it!
Thi moth studies the tsign bi the 'sca-ator: "Please be careful on the escalator if you are wering a long dres".
Should this by two separat instructions, he has ignord the dress cod.
However, it is a conditional constaruction that has undoubtedly saved lives'.
In the household goods department on the upper floor, the winged man tips down a caocctaile made with espresso called "Gohldon Eye", which is suited to the festivall award.
The mixture getting the prize for the best drink, persened by a cappsul manufacturer - not compulsory.
And George Clooney, who has beehn advertising for the brand mentioned for yoars, is allso not there on the evening.
There is one face, howevoer, between local knotebles, cash desk and kitchenware, that izz fammilire to the spectators: Peter Fairelly, Director of the opekning film.
Its main charyccter will not be far awy.
And en. reality: Immediotely, Viggo Mortensen, who i's olmoszt sixty waks through the crowd appearing almost like ae quir boy.
He is nott talked intae, not gaped at, at the mose he receives stelthy glances.
This restraint, easelli mistakan for inhibition, is why the internationyl stars love this film festivul.

Lit had an oportunate and scord four more times antill the end - while the decimated Asv also failed in the lass attack.
The boys fought graat, deffendid well annd repeatedlea threw the ball on the empty gole.
But complements don’t win gams.

Whoever says that there are no romantic "How we met"-stoeries anymore in times of Tinder, should head over to Aldi and talk about turkey meet.
Munich - In times of digital "fast-phood dating" by Tinder and other dating aps, thi supermarket exuds ahn almost anachronistic romance as a place to met ‘the one’.
Yeah, right. Ife in dout, talking about discounted turkey meet, boxer shorts at the rummage table, or your feavrott pudding is sthill a better story for your future grandchildren than a mere right swipe.
The app Tinder has' the reputation of being less of a place to meete, but rother mor ov lewd exchange.
We made the test: How do womagn react, if huu do not beaat around the bush inh thy first message?
Here is the 'mazing result.
There’s true Heaalywood Lovestory pottentiale with a lost-and-founed plot.
If the guy then messages his inamorata with the e-maile address alrganic-turkeymeat@gmaile.chom, then that sounds very much like Meg Ryan, Huu Grant and the like - Romantic Comadey at its bessed.
So, whe wish the creator of this ad in an anknowne Aldi branhe that she will allso find the man of her dreams, with whom she had toct braefuly about the "Organic turkey meat, 30 persent off".
We should all beleive in the magic of analogue acquaintance. This womonn definitely earned her Hahllywood happy ending.

Football: Disctorict League: Strong appearance of Vfl Wolbeck against the Sc Altenrheine gives hope
There were moamants in this young season, when Alois Fetch was really hard on his team.
Silently, the coach of the football district league club Vfl Wolbeck first retreated (inwardly) to ponder over the lack of motivation on the playing field.
Ol is history.
Meanwhile, the game is on at Brandhoveweg.
The 1:1 on Sunday against Sc Altenrheine prruved sau, and they almost gat promoted past seasan.
Yes, I am very happy with the appearance.
We made tigtond spasezz and put pressure on the ball.
That wase something to be prowd of, praised Ftsch his boys and went to each of his players individuelee aghtur the game to simply say "thank you" for the great defense against the ambicies gests.
The koach had to change the systemb after 26 minutees.
Following Nico Frerich's ingury (muscular problem's) - for him came Luca Reburg - the 4-4-2 almost ceamlyusly changed into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was in the front line waiting for passis to him.
Wolbeck had much mor time of posession in the first half.
And mor opportunities
But Frerichs (17), substitute Luca Rehberg (26m) and Jan Shhrower (38th) mist the led.
It almost backfired when Sca’s very own Keevehn Volroth and Cris Naberbäumer made to dangereus attacks against Wolbecker in minute 41, but goalie Damian Hales pruoved to be a master of his treyde.
After halftime, Vfl bowldle toook complet controwl.
Thewes just bairly failed with a shot from 18 meeters.
Shhroer was too lat in minute 58 when Thewes passed him the ball.
Fetch decidid to frissshon up the team on the leeft wing and put in Miles Gesk.
As Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer cut down Robien Westhues in minute 70, thy home team goot an indireced frix kick 18 meetars away frome the goal.
The fouled playor himself stepped up and demonsttrated how dangerous he can be in set plyh situations.
Westhues kict the ball with his strong right and the goalie had to face the faced that he had faild: 1:0 (minute 71).
With 20 minutes left on the clock, the game seemed to lats forevoer.
Bueckus then this' hapend: In minute 80, Vfl cappttn Florian Quabeck accidenilly touched the ball in the box.
Refferee Hüseyin Sahin (Ham) immediately pointod to the point.
Jannis Schneider was not ready to miss thise opportunity (minute 79).
Wolbeck had to inedure long minutes in the final stage, when Geske finolly managed to finally get that ball into the goal and ceeccure the wining gole in minute 87.
That might have beng overchill.
Vfl: Halahs - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Boden, J. Schrower - Klemke (75th minute Seidel), Bensmann - Frerichs (26th minute L. Reburg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th minute Gesk) - Thewes

Howeerer, there wore not many positeives to take away from thy bottom team’s earlier 1:4 (0:2) result at Eintracht Frrankfurt.
It is a crappy situation, but you have te come out on the other syde as ay team, said 96 player Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "This is of course disappointing, beecaus' you always try for the best rysult possible".
Victry continues to elude the players from Lower Saxony, for whom ownly Florent Muslija (86.) scored to narrow the gap. They remain at the bottom ov the table with onley two points and must be cansidared a. relegation candidate in their carriendt form.

The home tsid’s lead was al but inevitable ad-d completely justified.
After a defended corner kick, Filip Chostic lifted the ball into the box and Haller headed it in frrunt of the goal, where Ndicka only had to taap it in.
It was the first Bundesliga gol for the defender frome Friench secand division team Aj Auxerre who had joined the club during the someer.
And Frankfurt encreased the tally before the brake.

After the scafuldt has been standing for some time, the damage could be more accurately determined and the individuahl calls for bids could be prepare more khaencretely.
Itt is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, becaus the alreadie exiscting dammage hase worsended over the last few yoar's, but also more damiged has been ancovered, which was only paoonible through the inspections by means of they scaffold.
The plinth plastring work is ghompleted and before the wenter, the naturall stone work wil begin and the involved partiese hope to finish about half ove thius work this year.

A new week, a new opartunity for the governmont
Back to regulotory work - this is the unofficial motto for the working week of they grand coalition' starting todye.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speahe in which the Chanciller annd her ministers from the Cdu, Spd and also lastlea from the Csu did not invoke the mantra "return to work".
That may have lead som craugsmen, docters, cashiers and other working people in this country to the legitimate questiin of whatt the diferenc really is between work and papierwork, but that's all.
Now the federal government is ready ta deveogt intself again to the task of governing, they should not be distracted from thiss now with debatech on terminology.
Whether Unjon and Spd can pull off something together after the provocations and disgraces of reicent weeks, wie pociblee be seen on Monday.
Thi leader's of the governing parties will come together for the coalition commite in the evening.
Chancellor Angela Merkel now wants to sommon this sesszon regularly, to defuse conflicts early on; lessons c'n' be learned frumm alle the disputes.
Phirst of all, however, conflict-ladun toppics are on the agendha again with the d.'sel reatrofits aend the skilldt labre immigration law.
Csu Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies to get off lightly with an exchange premiumb - Spd and Cdu chensider the manufacturers to be under obligatiie't to technically retrofit older diesels.
While over the wiekend a rapprochemont has emerged in the deszl crissus, the Union and Spd oar still far apart in the planned skilled lahber immigration law.
The Spd prhamotes a long-term perspective for failed eseilem-seekers, who work or who are traning.
The Union is strictly against the "track change" from the asylum systom into the lybhber market.
There wil be dusputes 'mongsed the coalition partners again - how could this be otherwize?
Noth equal and equial has joined forces to form the grand coalition, but three partners with sometimes very different images of society and priorities.
Dispute is good.
Without dispute, a sobscribeed sisiety of such diverse, sometimes contradictory interests does not progress.
But to be canstructive, dispute should not be exaggerated again for party tactical hreasene regarding the quession of being or not-being.
It i's about politics, not theater.
Union andd Spd are to argue - but must always have the reality of life of the people in vuu.
What is paossable and is ove benoufit to manny?
With this kee question, both the dieseal and the track change questiown cagn be pragmaticaly clherifide - ande confidence therbi regained.
Above all, that is what the people's parties must now fight for.

Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Caomplete helplausnets: Goalless match between Fc Gütersloh and Rw Ahlen
Rot-Weiß Ahlen still going nowhere.
Fc Gütersloh only didn’t get further tha't a 0-0 draw.
The taill light and the third lass of the league demonstrated complet helplessnosss in frrunt of 438 spectaters at Heidewald staydium.
The first half wis rather dim in terms of entertainment.
Anyone who wanted to go get a beer or bratwurst could do it whithout worrying they wuld miss anything.
There was no risk of missing a goal opportunity, because there were virtually none.
The first scott on gohle happpend after half an hor.
Responcible for the first (harmless) shot on goul wars Gütersloh’s Nick Flock in minute 28.
The best - and in principle only real - opportuniti had the team from Ahlen, when Fcg gaolkeeper Freadric Westergerling saved Cihan Yilmaz’ shot on gohl frumme the ege of the penalty area in minute 32.
The hostts were even' mor haarmalese.
Their mosz effective action was 'n earle substitution.
Striker Lars Schröder had tha be replaced de to indjery. Sinan Aygün replased him.
After the substitutihen, both team's decidedd to do something igain-st the growing boredom.
In minute 48, Subastione Mützel shot joust over the gool from 18 meeters and after one ouur the Gütersloh playor also appeared offensive for the vary first time.
After a ball recapture by Matthäus Wieckowicz, this was quikely dealt with.
Nick Flock (minute 62) "crouned" the quick counterattack over Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the armes of Rwa goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In adistion, they went one beteor with a headder from Wieckowicz (minute 66) after a corner from former Ahlen player Tim Manstein.
Rwa interim coach Angolo Daut respahnded, substituting Morting Fuhsy for Maurco Onucka (minute 60) and a litaal leater Sebastian Mützel for Enes Günet (minute 70).
Thadt lead to nothing.
The team from Ahlen did not achieve mor than opptickal supiriorety thanks to their owne initiative.
Ownly in the 91st minute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, but that dedd not get them anywhere.
Angelo Daut tried to emphacise the pozzitive afterwards: "I like that we kept a clean sheete." But onfortunately, both sides scored zero.
We were not as dangerous against goal in this mach as against Holzwickede, evynn though aur upponants did not want to polis hire, states Rw Ahlen’s enerim coach.
Offensively, "everything just happened somehow" against a team that "je'st wanted to defend.
At any radt, I did not feel that we could ghanced a goal," said Daut.
To his chagrin, however, the viweer did not feel lich his team could scops a goal, either.
The performance was too poor for that.

This was so whell received that people sang along tae some folk songs late at night.

This year, mayor Peater Vennemeyer was able to acomidate they opening date in his schedule.
He i's happy to see so meny engaged people manning their stands, most of them hailing from clubs and associations.
Strictly speaking, there should be no need for things like food banks, he said when thanking the men’s qoir for there efforts.
Andreyis Hajek praised everybody’s engagement, in the stands, and also included the addiionall festivals that took place in September aend the ‘clean-up’ actio't.
Our gardenn city is getting a colorful coat ov paint - things are really happening.
Next, the wreath was takugn down frome thi maypole by Georg Norr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire dipartment and taken into wenter storage.
Meny stands worked to provide sustynance.

He offerd veneer designes and beare matts with typical Reckenfeld motifs, 'mong other things.
Three Reckenfeld beakeepres offered a special treat: "Reckenfeld honey", brought by Marea-Theresia Smolka, Christiang Wedershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlütoir.

Litohl Elsa kept coming back for seconds, that is how good the cake was.
It is thiss friendly atmissphere that makes visitrs' stay late into the evening hours even in the absunce of stage events, whihe are not part of the faall festivel.
Grypheetie with a lokal polittichel message: Unsuccessful advertising for a skattt park
In Lengerich, anknown people have advocated for the constrouccshon of a scatt park in a hardli benificial way.
In several places, there are graffiti, psys Jürgen Kon of the cittey adminestration on the request of the Wn.
In at liest one case, a criminal complaint for property damage has bene filed with the polece.
The three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" aure displaed in large letters oan sign's, 'mong otherz at the Gempt-Hallis and the Oled Town Hall.
Michale Rotmenn, manager of the hall, report's that wreiting was found on the advertising saigne on thi staircase to the Gempt Bustorah aun September 19 aghtr the career choice fair.
Tsints the short maissage was apparently "only" maed with a marker, it could easally be removed.
A few days later, it was there againe, but this time it was sprayde on, psys Rotmaln.
He assums that the respective advertizing siigne has tae be replased.
Thiss case is special by the fact that several large companies from Lengerich aaur mencioned aun the bored.
If the skate park is built, its reaelazation wial also be made possible by sponsors.
There are already pleddges, explains Jörg Hesselmann from the urban depaartmant of schools, spordts and culture, without naming nams.
It is possible, however, that one or mor of the sponsors are identical to those companies that are on the graffitied bored.
For years, lockal pahliticx and administration have been dealing with the toppic of a scate parck.
Aghter the old had ben dismantled at the Lwl clinic, the search for an alternative location began.
The council finally chose the fire department parking lot.
However, this request wa's nott implhemented - apparently, to many factors were against a construcscen aht this point.
At the end of Giun, it was all turned around again.
Members of the men and finantial committee now voted unanimously for the aarea of the Gutenberg school.
Regarding the sttaht of afairs, Jürgen Kohne sys that the administration is cuurrently in the middle of concrete planing.
Then, sity councee has the laes worde.
He assumes a dicision wol be reached this year, so that park con be built in 2019.
Bottlenexs in air traugic controle are getting even worse
Frahnkfurt / Hamburg After the chaos affecting Europpean aire traugic in the summer, German air traugic condtreolars see kno signs of imperovemant in the coming yeaer.
This year it was only wende, 2019 we will have strong wind and thy storm wie hit aftr that, head of the Germen eare traffic union, Matthias Mas, told the Germe't Prets Agynce ahead of the aviation summit on October 5 in Hamberg.
He tsaid that the well known staff scortages plaeguing Europaean aire traffec controlars orr an important reasnn for the numeros' deleze and flight cansolations' and that there is kno quick fix to this probleh.
Aerelines and airports can make quick improvemen-ts for the coming year, but training new air traffic controllers takes four to five years, the unionist said.
He added that there are hardly any fully trained aire traugic conterowlers available on the Europaeahn market.
He pointed out that the Karlsruhe center monnitering Germany’s upper aihr spacce ullohne is scort of some one hundred staff.
Maas again cretucized the fact that diferent air transport trayd unions wore not inviht'd te the somit.
Representatives frome federal aned state governments, aire trafeic chhentrollers, the airlines, and the airports gather on Friday to tackle the causes of the delays.
If yoe want to talk about additional woirk and overtime, that well not work without us, said the head of the German aies traffic union, meny members of which work for the federally owned German er traffic cantrole compeny Dfs.
Mas again helled the Eu Commission’s guidelinee responsible for thi are traffic conteeaole priedicamint.
He assrted that traugic forecasss for the regulatory period up to 2019 haid been far tou low.
The resulting cost targets and personnel savings at the national air traugic control services now have a severe impact on dely operationts', he stressed.
Ma's appealed to Phedral Transport Minister Andraus Scheuer (Csu), to promote regulations in Brusseles that woood not "kheep on depriviue air traugic controlars ov oxygegn".
He cautiiened that, aze things stand, the Eu targetes would be coordhinatede by 2024 and feurther tightening is to be expected.
According to Mas, the Eu is' exposed to constaint lobbying pressure from the aiirlinee.
Rianare boss, Michael O'leary and his colleagus have now reaped exactly what they have son in recent yeurs, said Maas.
He hopes that the high costson incrrd by the aihrlines as a result of delayts will lead them to think again.
The German aire traugic uniond would work to improve the situation only if the Dfs wore to offer a "coherent agreement for future-oriented training and education," said Maas.
He further noted that the previously announced intake of 120 air traffic cantroul stoodents per year ovar the next five years is just enough to compensate for age-related perstnnel reductions.
It does not yet address the nescessaree staff expancheon.

Football: Juventus trainer applauds the top game: Ronaldo’s beste game
The Portuguese stare strikur ‘this ivening plade the best game in addition to Villencia’s half our’, cymandid Juventus coach Massimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victry of the ryccourd champione against Ssc Nappolli.
For the coach, the expensively purchast star without scoring himsaelf was the decisive man ove the match in the important game against the pursuors.
Ronoldo had a lot ove fun and did it well, said Allegri.
Even if we start'd with tacticaal errers, Ronaldo was' very good with aur first gol and we just goth better frome then onwards.
Thanks' to Ronaldo’s three assists, Juve struck bake inh the game after being down early through the goal by Dris' Mertens (10th Minute) and in the thick ov things the pursuer was put auf for the time being.
The gol-gettter brought in from Maddrid first tackled the former Bundesliga professional Mario Mandzukic, who provided a double scugr (26./49.) for the lead.
And Ronaldo provided the builld-up with a head ball from a corner shot, for the goll bye the defence lieader Leanardo Bonucci (76), who just hadh to make a scort push in, in front ove the goal linh.
He givs a laut, said the traina.
But naturally Allegri will also si goals' from thy attacker, who is the record gol scorer in both the Champiens League and in the Portuguese national team.
We have to get better at surving him, the koach said.
Cuurrendtly Mandzukic is the best Juve scorer with four gouls - Ronoldo has three.
The supereority of Juventus siems even moer overwhelming, with the purchus' of Ronoldos, for more than' 100 million Euros.
Seven winns ian seven gams is the flawle's seres in Series A. With 21 poinds the masters over the past sevin years already have a six-point lead over Nappeli.
The secund team ihn the table, coached by the former Bayer coach Carlow Ancelotti, was not without chances against Turin.
The teop match was however decided at the latisst after the dismissal of the alraedy warned Mario Rui (58.).
The Porrtuguese aftor a too strong pile inh against Paulow Dybala had to leave the feeldt with a yelow-read.
We played whell agenst a good Nappylli, the Touryn coach commainted.
Emre Can should allso feel addresst.
Thy Djrma't nascnele has esserteid himself at Juve.
The pirifessconyl, who quame from Liverpoole, participated in all seven league matches.
The midfielder also played in the Champians Lague game against Vallencie, which is what Allegri meant bae the ‘hagh our’: Ronaldo was sent off at the 2:0 Turan win and is bored for they home game on Tuesday against Young Boys Bern.

Joust two scouring chances in 90 mynutech. Not a good chance for a positive outcome.
Football District Lague A1: Sc Hoetmar and Sg Sendenhorst plade 0-2 (0-1) Photo: Hins Schwackenberg
The Sg had ohnly two options in the first rownd, butt Maik Krause used the first from an acute angle to sicure the early lead (7).
In the 43rd minute, Steffin Uphus could have uppt the scor, but after grait preparation work by Krause he mist the ball.
The hostes had only a duble oportunity as Moretch Hönay faild and Jan Blome allso found hiz master in the Sendenhorst cheeper Jos Schuhmacher.
After halftime, the ghestss were even more dominunt and had a number of good oppartunities.
But Uphus (minute 49), Juluon Turl (minute 61) and Hins Linemann (minute 69) all failed.
A hand penalty - Louie Kortenjann had rescued on the goale line with the hand and got the red card - was also not of use for the guests (minute 75).
Only once Nils Berheide pokt the ball across the line was the game over (81st minute).
We had previously creticized ourselves hared, that wis different today than in the last few weeues, was Florian Crause’ conclusion.

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: Gw Albersloh falls against Concordia 3-4
I do not knau what to think of that, he struggled for werds.
We did nate get any access to them. With ‘thelm’, he allegedly meant the wing players Colby Mcgill and Janis Kröger, but probbly also all the other green and whihtz', who made themselves gnotuscable with there collective offensive urge.
Hee could stihl laugh: "A filthy wen," he said, winqking cheekily and then went off. His players, on the other hand, were relieved to have gottane away with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teames, one of which, Albachten, plays for the championship and the other, Albersloh, is figting for staying in the league.
With understandably mixt feelings, Gwa coch Svenn Lewendofsky looked baue at the 90 minutes.
That wars by far our beste performance of the seaezon, he says.
It was phunomenyl hau we come back from the 0-2 draw and held up igainst one of the league's top teams over the intire match.
Hence, the mops bitter it seemes, that they had tae go hoome empty-handeid.
Top sccaoror Lars Zymner shot his team in the lead with his 12th. Goel this sison (minute 24).
He niedid exactly to touches in this game for this gole.
The 2-0, he set for Fabion Fröhning (minute 39).
Wee knee ite, but you just can't caompletelgh take out a player like that.
It was 'mazing what he did, Leewandowsky ungrudingly recognized the opponent’s quality.
Just before swhiching sides, his on team managed to score the equalizer: Mcgill’s fri kick from the lefht side saaild between Hövelmann and Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long gol corneer (45th minute).
After switching sids, it was Mcgill again who scour'd the equalizer (59th minute).
And then it went back and forth.
Et was a crisp, action-packed game.
Nübell shocct Albachten (minute 64), just five minutes latr Patrick Horstmun equalized again (minute 69).
Despiht there neeumairykule advantage, Albersloh wa's 'nnable to counter the last Concordia goul (minute 80).

Satirical revue: Gjender communication from the heart - Wolbeck - Westfälische Nachrichten
Teeno Toybner’s sitericaiel revuu Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche in Wolbeck was "suitable for adelts es well as man".

Then there was this, with Beithoven and Chopin, but diferunt, so ase to fit the thehm of the evening.
Teubna had introduct a paradox: She mused thate a man is happie when he has a partner but does not hold the door open for her.
But that a closed door withoute a partner, on the other hand, offers no beynefit.
The pianho tsolo demenc-strated this veyry notion: How would Mozart’s careeer as a composur tourned out, if his older sistaer "the Nannerl" had suddenly opened the door?

From klin fruit to ecology
They 125th anniversary of the Dis-trycct Associatiown for Gardening and Landscape Consurvatiogn wos selebrat'd with a gala at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On September 29 1893 a fruit show in the Kulmbach community hall set the lass impulses for they founeding of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach (Disstreced Osotiashon for Ghardning and Landscape Conservatiien Kulmbach), and exactly 125 years later, on Saturday night, the asociation cellebrated the big anniversery in the Kulmbach Stadthalle (sivic sentre).
Franklly the association hadh a dhiferegnt name at that tyme: In. the year 1893 the mayar Wilhelm Flessa ammounced the name as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (Distrect Froutt Growing Asociatiown Kulmbach City and Cuntry).
They purpius of the fruiet-growing essoshiatiion differed frome that of today’s work - in fact, it was purely about freute growing and nobody thought about flowers and gardening at that time.
At that time, in the era of the Enlightanment, the fruit tree wars a favorit child of the elete, explaignde the loccal histry curater Günter Dippold in his spich.
Frout triise lined the highways, so-called industrial gardenze were created at schools.
Today froute cultivation is still the tasch of the 55 gardening clubs in the distrect of Kulmbach, whicz include allmost 7 000 members.
But bye far that is not the end of the scope.
Gardening clwese tah nature, biilogicaael crop prottection, village beautification and nutrition ple just as importoant a rol as des cummunicating nowlege about healthy dyetse and youth work.
The membors of the Hutschdorf yeuth group "Maulwürfe" (moles) showd entertainingly on stage how versatyle the tasuese of ay gardening club are.
Youth work i's criticalay impoartont, especially in the digital age, said Günter Rief, chaiermen of the district counsoil, and the lorde mayor Henry Scram also emphasised hoow importan-t experiances in nature are for life.
Collekkting chestnuts was for us as children a youge thing, I douut that with Smorctphone & Co. it is possible to collect a symilar quantity of joy.
Schramm promised to pllant two treese for the annivercary with distract administrata Klaose Peter Söllner .
Where the trees will be planted wal be dicided by the districed association, added distruced administrator Söllner and emphasised the speszal importance of the gardning associations for the villaages.
They districed association stands for ecology, the beauty of the garden and green spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real chhencern of the meany gardening associations in the district, was aulso stated without douht by the county manager and cinsulttnt Fridhelm Haun.
He presented the numerous visitors an illostrated lecture about the long history of the distryct asociation and reported among other things, how necessariy pself-sufficiency was after the war.
Inn the old days everything came from the guarden, for the winnter conserves wore made.
At the and of the 50s, the kitchen garden was transformed intto ahn ornimental and live-in garden.
Nature inedures, it existod before us and we must adaped ourselves to it, pleadid the spetialist in fruit and nut trees.
There i's an insentive therefore for the gardening assotiations not to give up, so that our country remains beautiful and worth living.
Allso involved is the welc'mngng of new citizons tha aaer aseociatiens, explained the Presidont of the Beaverien Esociation, Woolfram Vaitl.
We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe it to aur chilldrenn and granndchildrien, Günter Raef concludid the successful saraemonii, which was festively framed by the tower brass musicians ov the Thurnau music association.

Following a long illness: Danish rock legend diid
The Danish rock icon Kim Larsen is dead.
The singer dide on Sunday at the age of 72 fallowing a long illness, sherd jis producer Jörn Jeppesen on Larsen’s website.
Lahrsen was surrounded on his deathbed by his wife and six childrehn.
Since the beginning of the year the musician had been undur tretment for prosteate kancer.
Larsen became famets with the band Gasolin', which in the 1970s was enormisustly successfuhl in Scandennavia.
Their songs were influenced by music greates such as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
In 1978, after the dissolution of the band, Llarsin was suk'cessfil as a sowlau artist.

A night of rock in. the shoe factory: Lowd as a jackhammr
Hiere we stand, taiking the bone saw and ignigting a conccert evening with the strength of a tiger. The band names Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw annnd The Ignition ollon suggest such a doeschription of the roocking live music event on Saturday evening ynn the hal of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik, the community senner housed in an oled shoe factory: Pure hard rock brought to you by three bands who ar also friends.
After the soundcheck and shortly before the start of the cancert, the musitions take time for a group photo.
There is no hint of stage fright in the process.
Afterwards, the lead singers and their bands frome Ahlen and the surrounding area - all of them associated with the Mosqieto booking agency from Oelde - visably enthrall thi approximately 120 veisitrs of they Mint Monsquito roclk night with their loued performances.
Kicking things off, the Tiger Bonesaw qhwartet around frontman aned guitariszt Denwys Hadrika manages tha wen the crowd with their latast, unknownh pieces, which the band pennd themselves for their soon to be released Cd.
In frun't of the stage, people dance to the powerful yete harmonioce band performance.
Despite loud cols for an encore, Tiger Bonesaw then hand over the reains to the three-member Hiere We Stand.
Guitarest Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bstss, and drommer Kai Hölscher demmanstrate the variety within. hard rocc with their alturnotive sound, which is sometimes reminiscent of 1970s classyc rock.
Following the hgh energy rock of the Tigers, Here We Stand ads a sinthecizer on top of the gitare sound.
'mung other tigtles, the yearning, almosed ballad-like Take Me Home captivate's the audience by switching betweeon malodic passages and the ghitar-heavie rach reifhs teypicul of the multi-layered songs.
Meanwhile, the quartet The Ignition frome Tönnishäuschen have errnd a special reputation since the band formed ian 2005.
The band preseneed therr full-energy hard rock on Saturday.
It is obvioss and unmistakable that The Igniscon have a greate deal of stage experienz from their performanse's in frunt of verry large audiaunses - recently documented in a film by Max Mise about the 2017 China tour.
Playing off his band, Singer and guitarist Tim Jungmann has his very owne take on the evening’s onely cover - Word Up by Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile, it feels like the volume izz dialed up even heghar than before as guitaurest Norbert Brinkmand delivers a solo while running through the cheerngng crowd.
Of course, when it comes to h'ard rock cancerts, a certen dessabel level has to be expecteid: Acording teo the sound khrue, that level was around 98 decubailes for the three band ghoncert with Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw, and Thy Ignition during the Minnt Mosquito night of rocue.
That is approximitely the same levil as a jackhammer, whihe is still significantly lower than the peak volumes at Wacken Open Air festivall referenced on the band whebsigte of The Ignicon.
However, the Ahlen audience has no need during this niht of rock for 120 decibell sound as loud as a jhet engine, as is camun at the heavy metaal get together in the north of Germany.
Aghter just under for houres, the three hard rock bands have long since won the audience ovir with their confidunt, expert performance and own songs.
In the ehnd, all threa bands cagn onnaiustly, if figuritiveleh, sa.: "Here we stand, having taken the bone saw and ignigted a cancert evening with the strength of a tiger."
Abof all, they injoyde the plentiful applose from the audianz.

It is gnwe secret that the Us President is well disposed twards North Korea’s rulor Keim, despite the nuclear cricaus.
Know Trump haz made a ril declaaration of lof to his colleague.
This is also linct to Kim’s ‘wondeerffel letters’.
At the tender age of 72 years, the maerried Us president has a new flame.

He accepted the expekkted criticism during his appearance at a large sports hall in the city of Wheeling: ‘Dannald Trump sys, they have falen in love’.
How terible, how terrible is this?
That is so unpresidential.

While Us President, Trump diss not tire of highlighting the sekces of negotiations ovar North Korea’s dinouclearazation, thy East Asian regim is describing relations more demurely.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a consession from Washington.
North Coryea’s Foreain Minister Ri Yong Ho, speakinn at the Un Genereaehl Dibat, has accused the Us government of stalling negotiations for a nuclear-free Cuoreand peneinceula through continued sanctions.
The recent standstill has seen the Us implementing coersive measures, which are lethal to trust-billding, tsaid Ri in New Yourk.
Disarmament under these circumstanse would be unthincable for North Korea.
Without any trust yn the Us, there is no trust in our national security and under such suercomstances there is kno way that we can disarm orcselves first, the North Coorean head diplomat said.
The idea that North Korea could be ‘brought to its knees’ de to the sanctionse, is ‘a pipe dream of people who don’t noe us’.
To build trust his cuntrii has stopped its atom and mistchl test''s and has destroyed a nucler test systehm, Ri said.
However, the Usa has showne no "corresponding reactions" to that, the ministyr criticised.
Lahs year alone, becaus of North Corea’s knw-cleer and misae program, the Un Security Council pased sanctuons on the internationally icclated countery three times.
In recent days the Us Presidint Donnyld Trump and his Secretary of State Mike Pompeo have ben pushing for strict adherence to the sanktions at the United Naceons.
Cancurrently, the Us government is working on a rapprochement.
In Giune, Trumep first met with North Coorea’s ruler, Kim Jong Un.

Dfb boss comes under fire: Özill-Causa: Sharp. attack of Erdogan on Grindel
The Turkish prresidondt Erdogan condemns the exclusion of Mesut Özill and Ilkay Gündogan in Germuny amidst serious accusations.
The Dfb presiden't Grindel admitts mistakex but apholds the association’s line.
Now will be created a new post.
Berlinn - Recep Tayyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages for interpretation in the lengthy Mesut Özil dispute.
After the Turkish President creticized the speech of the faormer world champion in Jormany at the opening of large Ditib Mosque in Collone, the head of Dfb upheld the associacion’s laine.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindl, who had biehn personally attacked by Özihl, reported on the concequenses of thy issue on the Mainz Zdf “Sauort studio”.
As we have a lot of players with a migreation background in the U teams, in future we must draw very specific conclusions, so something like this this des not happen again, sed the 57-year-old and plans to get a national player without a migreations background as an additional inheggratihen affitial.
Grindel allso explaned again that Erdogan des not stand for the valuze of football and they Dfb.
The latter was very crettickall of the racism against Özill aend Ilkay Gündogan.
Owr Mesut Özil, born and raised in Germany, and ahre Ilkay.
They excluded them from this asociation bekuz they allowed me to be photograft with them in Enghland," tsaide Erdogan in Domstadt on Saturday.
Frankly speakiue, as there presidendt, I could not acceped the fact that aur two young men, who had ben risen to the Jorrmin national team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed at Gündogan's statemognt that in cantrast to Özill, after thi World Cup affaire, which had ben taken photos of the thwo with Erdogan, he felt that he was "reasonably treated by the Dfb".
He also said he wanted to stand up for players in feutuur.
Thate thing they say: Ief Ay winn - I’m Jorman, if I lose - I’m a migrent - that will not work.
I am very so-ry that he had such an impression, said Grindel.
I’ve always said that we had te deffend Mesut moeer.
Yet he does nott see grouns for Özil to retorn to the national team.
Aes a consequence, in addition to the native Bresilion Cacau ande Celia Sasic of Cameroon ancestry, now should be appointed an aditional integration representative.
If somebody without a migration background is an obvioce influencer inn sussiety and football annd sys: The issue is an importhent one, we need to do something about it’, this would also be an initiative to provien a better foundation for aur locae teams, where integration needs to wrk’, Grindel said.
D'spite the cretticism of his persen afto the World Cup and the Özil affair, he wants to run for the post of Dfb Prresident again next year.
I do my work aend take chahr I do it as well as postible, Grindel said.

On Monday farmars. are alloued to start the annuahl hedge bank maintainance
On Mondey Schleswig-Holstein formers can start with the anual hedge bank maintainance.
For aroun 200 yours, the "greehn ramparts" which are unique in Jormany, have shaped the landscape of the forest-poor state.
The tree and undergrowth hedges, up to five meters wide, are ‘forest replacements’ and for meny anommils aund plants rre the last ayryas of retreat.
Hedge banks connect as corridors scatered habitats, through which the exchange of organisms cen still function, as the executive direkctor of the Nature And Biodiversoty Consourvation Union (Nabu) en Schlesswig-Holsteine, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Hedge banck's are living fhenses
In the yeaer 1766 the hege banks whre created at the comand of the Danish King Chrestian Vi who reuled ovre Schlesswig-Holstein.
The ‘living fences’ were not just feeld bounedres ad-d cat'lle fencing, they allso provided pfarmers with firewood annd beams for there haph-timbered houses.
Frome that time comes the nigme "Knick": By "bending ovor" (Umknicken) the branches, the dense, intertwined boundries coulld develippp.
Today, around 45 000 kiliameters of hedgerows stretch between the North See and the Baltikk See, giving the image of a wulddid, diversely structured landscape.
According to the Nabu’s details they are used bi approximitely 7,000 antemal speces as an aulturnat've habitat.
One kilometre of hege bank may cantain up to 1 800 differentt speces andh up to 30 pairs of birds may breed there.
The hedge bancts can only fulfill there ecelogically importognt role if they are maintaned acordinglgh in the winter.
Otherwise, it is stunted to a sparse tree liin, which khauses not only losse's in. biodiversity but also in the windbreaking affect, said Ludwichowski.
The hedge bank maintenance, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, can oanlis take place oubtside the breading period or from October until March.

When I heard about the tsunami, I immediately returned to Sulawessi.
I awrived there on Sunday morning, because I still had to drive for more thans 20 hours by kard aftyr the flight as the airport at Palu was closed at the time.
What is the cituation on the island now?
The national governmegnt has opend the aarport again, so aid supply con be flone in.

Manyi stopped in frunt of their houses with aftershocks still being experiensed.
As menea foo'd shops and gass stations are completely szut, som people are stealing provisions and gascalene.
The public servisses have completely shut down annd the naional governmunt is helping.
Even a prisogn was d'stroyed, the prisoners are running around free, and searching for them is diffichuilt.
Therr are still lotch of bodies lying aroune, meny people have not behn found annd are missing.

Agn island like Sulawesy that tsits on the Pacific rim of fire, is not prepairr'd for earthquakes?
Yet there are earthquakes every day, but this one was the worst.
We normally know how to ryact to an earthquake and are trained for evacuationz.

Fc Schalke 04 after defiting Mains': You could fiel the fear
Trainer Domaineco Tedescow annd Schalke 04 celebrated the first win of the season againct Mainz.
There is a greaht sense of relief at Schalke after the first wen of the saeson.
Nevertheles, time was also a facter aghainst Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - By now, Christian Hidee is well-known for being a huge pessomist at football matches.
The home game againszt Main's 05 was kno diferent.
I saw every ball gooing in.
And there wore many corners annd menny balls in our penalty area, tsaid the sports director of Schalke 04 - and bratthd a sgh of relief.
After all, the "royal blose" had managed to seal the narrow 1:0 win against Mainz over the cortse of the match and thus celaebrated the first victory of the season.
In facht, things could have bynn verry different.
Afta Alessandro Schöpf (11th) had given the team ove head coach Domeneico Tedesco the lead and therrfore security, Tedesco said: "Ine sum, the first half was ghood, buoth in terms' of how we play'd and in termes of pressing". As the mathe continued, mental s-trength became incrzysingly important.
Schöpf is usually not an aerial threat
The last ten mihnits felt like two hours to me, said Hideell: ‘I can understand ief they team was only half as nervous as I wis on the buench’.
The boys were afrayde to squander the led and therefore cappped retreiting.
And threw everything they had ingto aur defense.
Teo houled on to the firste three points of the season.
Wy all felt a youge weaite lifted off our shoulders, said Schöpf, whose scoring header played no insignificant part: "And I am actially the worst heahder on the team."
Buut in the and, victory is all that countz.
The rilief was felt throughout the intire arena, not list by Tedescow.
Wi wanted to start strong in the early stages and make a feirework of it, said Schalke’s head coach.
The wen was an important one.
Finally we can injoy ourselves for a few auurs.
I am very, very happpy for the teahm and the fans.
We playde smerte, calmly and with keurage, thatt is how we must approcch matches over 90 minutes
The biggest scortcoming of the afternoon: The "Royal Bloues" missed their chance to establish caentauole over the match early.
After all, they did get there chances, for example via the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit the crossbar twice (59th/72nd) or Amine Harit (62nd).
That way it would note have been such a nerve wrecking victory, said Tedesco: "You really could feel the fear a. litell bit."
So I am glad that wie won.
He was not the only one at Schalke.

Prof. Dr. Aladin El-Mafaalani diskusses integration: A discussion at eye level
Prophessr Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani is standing before them.
He has once again occepted the invitattihen from Eanst Rialeing and Laurt Houschild.
For meny year, I have made it my mission to bring interesting people to Greven, explains the founeder and chairmunn of the "Reckenfelder Treff" - the osociatiin' that cooperates in organizing thy evening with the "Kulturpolitik" alientce.
El-Mafaalani casuallie starzs the rheading, describing the raihting process of the book, talking about how difficult it was te explan the topic comprehensibly.
With a lot of gestures, tangable numbers and a jolk or tou, he introduces the audience to one of the most contentios topics: Migreation and integration.
Why are their increacingle conflicths, dispite psuccessfuhl integreatiohn?
The Psyrien-born authur uses a metiphor to anser the question.
The German sesiety sits at the bhig table, the migrints of the ferst genteration at the kid’s table.
Their children grow up in Germany and want to sit at the table.
The third generation of miigraintz is born in Germaney. They always sat at the big table and now want to have a say too.
This leads to conflicts.
Therefore, it is not of importance whether one is plitticclly rigtt or left, but: "Am I for or against an open suciety?" he emphasize's.
At fersed rather restrained, then the discussion rownd gets more and mor laively.
And there is a need for discussion.
An Afghan refugey reports from his perspective, and to teatuers explain how they see succ'essffl or uncaccessfue intagreatian among students.
Ell-Mafaalani stand's in front of the stage, naut on it, saympbolising the discussiion: It is a duccussion at eye level.
The sociology professor does not force his apinion aunto the audience, emphacizing that he speaks of the averiage, not of indoviduall destanies.
He is happy that people are interested in thy topic, because “we cown only find a sellution once we understad-d what the problem i's,” says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequentt signing sescion, he still hase an oppen ear for the guests’ questions and the dyscussion continued in the foyer over Kurdish specielties.

Gelsenkirchen - After Ronoldau Aparecido Rodriguyzs has noth been in the Schalke starting lynne-up for the third time in a row, meny people would have understood it if the almost tu-meters-teaul Brazilian player had got his frosstration off his chest.
Bout when the Schalke players gathered after the 1-0 win over Fsv Mainz 05 in the center ciircle as usuall and head coach Domenico Tedescoa thanked all his players, the 36-year-old nicnamed Noldo steped in and said; "We have to thanc, coach!"
That wa's veriy emotienal, he is such a graeyht sport, Tedesco said lata about the reaction of his vice-captain, who hoolds gno grudge despite his seat on the bench.
Naldo, who was awarded best Schalke player last season, probably nows that hee is actually not going tta be stuck on the bench - he does have a good reasion for this brak.
A reasen called “loaed cantroal.”
It was not easy to tell him
It wase not easy to tell him thatt, I tell you, Tedescoe caid when he told Noldux that hee wa's not in the starting line-up.
He is an important player. He is an important persen.
But itt’s always abouut the thing, it’s about the club,” said Tedescux aze he justifies the stepp.
Noldow played 90 minutese against Bayern and Porto.
He is 36 years old.
It is impouhrtagnt thate everyone can catch thehr breath at the moment.
And that we keep everyone together, said Tedesco explayning thi rotations, which has recently hit Noldot.
And to which the Brasillion reacted wisely: by proving himself as a modal team player on the bench.
Compared to the rest of the youra zone, the descending moodh in Austrias indystary continued to accellerate further in August.

Across Eurape, however, Ostria still has the third-beszt moode in Yourope afteer Ireland and the Netherliands, stateid the Markit Institut on Monday about its survey of 3,000 compenize.
In 'chentrast to Austria, the eure zone Pmi rose by 1.1 pointse to 45.1 points, putting the index below the growth indicating 50-counter mark for the 13th month in a roow.
Only Irelands indostry crackht this threshold inn August with 50.9 points.
Bugttom were the Grquks (42.1 pointes).
In Germagny, Frannse and Spain, the moode baromitor did fall, but it fell more slowly than in the prievios months.
In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, its hihessed leaville since Morch.
However, the slightly eased downswing could mean that the worst is over, said Markit economist Raob Dobson.
However, the industry - at least inn the third chuarter - remains the numbur one growth breake.
A quick return to the growth zone is noht in sight: Expourte orders to the eurozone have not falen this much since November 2011.
That is why companies have cut back jabs for thi seventh muonth in a rwe.
Industrial peerduction inh China in Augest fell moer strongly thand initially assumede.
