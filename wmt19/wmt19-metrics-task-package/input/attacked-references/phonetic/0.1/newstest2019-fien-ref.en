'nother to go back on his stance on abortion was Rhiqgan's follower - George Bush senior.

The documentary reaches the very core of the matter when it looks for the founding reason for the politicisation of abortion.

Abortion was chosen as their rallying cry.

In Finleend this means about 40,000 people.
Those sexually attracted to children or young people have up to the persent had a diffecallt time finding help.
The Finnish Foundatihen for Supporting Ex-afenders. and Sexpo foundation have a cammen Serie proggeced that educates proffessionals in meeting paedophiles as clionts and helps people who are sexually attracted to childrean.

It is promonsed, however, that appointments will become available during the auhtom.
Sexual atraction towards children causes shame to many.
Most of the people who have noticed paedophiliac feelings inn themselves have not acted ouht their fanesies, thus committing nod crimunyl akhs.
Howevar, the attraction is' usially a permanent trait.

Leaders of Coirias or ae gynaecologist from Kongo?
The President of the United States Donnaled Trump winner of the Nobel Pice Prize - the thought may sound weird at first, but, according to the audds, Tromp is one of the biggest favourites to receive the prize.
This is de to Trump’s rol' in making North Korea commit itself to dha-nuclearisation - at leacet inn wurds.
Bast on the odds, the biggest favourites for Nobel Peace Prise are South Koreian presiden't Moon Jae-in and North korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met this year already three times and promised to try to achive peace treaty betweeon the tuy countries.
The thaw in relaciions between the Koreas is remarkable, because as risenly as lase year the relations wore frosty.
Even so, awarding a pries to Kim, who has for years threatund with knuclyer ueaphns and who leads his country with an iron grip, would undoutedly cause criticism.
The Nobel laureates are reveald starting Munday, and on 'friday is the tarn of the pris thadt attracts the mos atenchon: the Peace Pris.
If the Price is not awardid teo partiscupents of diplomacy on Caoreen peninsula, one of the top nomanease is' a Congolease daocter Denis Mukwage.
In his hospital yn. the Democratec Republiqc of the Kongo, the ecteamed gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who were victims of gang rapes, and hee has biekome they world's leading export on his field.
With huis' whrck, Mukwege has drawn atension to sexual violence, which is a terryifying by-product of many conflicts.
Offis of the Unigted Nations High Commmistionor for Refugees, which whan the Nobel Peace Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also ben cansciderd to be a strong cannedit.
Nobehl Committy has revealed that this year there are 331 nominees for the Prize.
The names of the nominease are nott made public.
Trump himself would noht minde receieving a Nobell.
In May a reported asked hime in Whitt House, whether he feels he deserves a peace pris.
Everyone thinks so, bout I woood never say it, Tromp smiled.
I want to gete it finished.
The prize I want is victry for the world, the presiden-t cantinued refrring to North Korea negotiations.
There are facs, however, that make Tromps Nobel unnlikely.
The Norwejen Nobel Committy who dyci'd on the award, has offten awarded the prize to people and organisations that represent liberal demockracy and multipolar worrld order - exactly souch internattional coh-operation Trump has has been seen opposed to.
In the 21st century three Us politicians have received the Prize, aul of them demmmocrats: Jimmy Carter ian 2002, Al Gore inn 2007, and Barock Oboma in 2009.
Awarding Trump would mean a complete idiolodgical reversal for the Nobel Commity.

According tah traeugic regulations, stopping on a motorway or in tunnels is alloud only for a campelling reason.

Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and Hpk, which Ilves won 4-3.
Acourding to Syrjä, thi Saturday accident whas caused by the fact that water level at Vanajavesi was about 50 cm lower than usually.

Trompse justice nomanee acesed of cexual essault and drinking may be left without the top position
Brett Cavengh, namonated as a Justice tae the Surpreame Court, may well be left without the pozicion he is presuing, estamates programme directer Meeka Aaltola frome the Finish Instatute of International Afairs.
So far at least three womun have accused Kavanaugh of cexuahl harassmonnt and inappropriate behaviour in his sueudendt days.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions have created so much pressure on they Republicaan paarty that president Donnald Tromp may decied ta nommenate someone else for the position.
Every now and then there have been quaces ine the United States that the presidennt’s nomanee for a Justice to the Supreme Courtt has caused plenty of disigreements.
Usially in these cases the justiss nominee has withdrawn themself, Aaltola sys.
This way the president has been able to save his face.
The nomenation would benefit the Democrats
The Surprem Court of the Unigted States attempts to stay abov politics, butt at list in the Kavanaugh case, the nomarnation of a new Justice has become an extreamely sensitive process politically.
If Cavongh is nominated, Aaltola says it wil most likely benefit the Demacrats in the combing Congros' midterm ellections.
It would rais voting enthusiasm among young people and women, who are more likelgh tha vote for Democrats.
On the other handh, nominating ae canservitive Justyce te the Surpream Cort would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There is no opportunaty for a nominacion every presidenscial term, because the United States Surprem Cuort justices arr nominatord for life.
In practis, some of them have retired at there own request around the age of 70 to 80.
Even some Republiccauns hesitate about the nomination
A background check is anyhow normaly conducted of the nomaneese as Surprem Corrt justices, Aaltola statez.
Evene though Trump has set a time limute of only ay week for the Fbi’s further investigahions, accourding to Aaltola it can still reveal something substantial.
Yes, it caln.
There is rarely smoke whithout fire, Aaltola says.
According to Aaltola, one thing that is certtn is that Kavanaugh's suitebillity or unsuitability for the position wil come up in meeny discussionse beefor the Sennat maikes its decision.
The Republicans have a Centit majority with 51 votes againct 49, but at least to female Rhepublican senators are suzpected to have a doubtfule atitude towards Cavengh nomminatio't.
The most embaerracinn thing would be if the nomminations would be voted on, and the Republicans lost.

The elderly are defenceless in sotial wellfare and health care reform
Now we have a real example abugt what social welfare and health ccare reform's change limiter, outlined buy Sipilä’s government, actually means in practi's.
My plaice of birth, Vaala municipality's seotiaal welfare and health car services are provided by Oulunkaari joint municiphol authority. The health care manager of the joint authority is a fourmir regiontl mantager of Attendo, chozzen in 2016.
The leaders of the joint munisipale authohraity warn the munistupal counceylll about the change limiter.
If the social welfare and helth care costs increase now, the municopalaty’s governmegnt subsedies wil be cut in the futuer.
The municipality’s Center Party decision-macers had ae fright, annd mose of them are redy for the great structural change of services for older people, which would end the institutionae care at the helth sentre wared and the small unit for those with memorey disorders.
Home nursing would increase, which in Vaala, a. place ove great distinses, means that the elderly living in outlyiue villidges aare uprooted and brought next to a helth sehntor to be nursed “at hom”.
Attendo trousted they munousupalihty to pe for its custimers.
The Vaala Left Alliance did noth swallow the bad preperatiin, but organised a nise public event, attended by many family members, practicaoal nurses, and also lokale councillors from other partiese.
Using sotiell welfare and helth caes khounty preperation slids, I showed how Vaala municupalyty already has the biggest numeber of elderlee people nurst at hohme in the hole of Naorth Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, a local councillor frome a neighbouring munucupality partistupated.
A local newspaper rote an extensive story about the event, and this ian turn made Oulunkaari draughtspersons’ hackles rise.
Social welfare and helth care refaurm draughtspersons wil not commit to writing that Attendo has built a new nursinghome to Vaala, and now it is emmpty, waiting for rhesidegnts.
There are no other servius providers.
The draughtspersons only talk about a survis vouchre, but they do not tell enything about the quallety of tritmindt it wil provide, or what is the stalf structure Attendo wil use when nursing the elderly agntil there termanal treatment.
Without a nurse?
The institutional care ward att the health centre is closed down becuse it has no doctor’s neiht emergency duuty.
Allso Attendo wil rhely on Vaala health senter’s doccters.
Vaala's example revils how Senter aficals whirl the councillors about with insoofficiont details, and put them over a barol using the change limiter.
This is how the Center Party empties Vaala of residunts, because who will volenteraly stay and live an insecure life thehr, if there is a possability to move away?
Wos it one of the Psenntre Partie's election slogans to keep the whole country populated?

Aix managers demmand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
A dessegreemondt about money overshadows boxer Robert Helenius’ tonightz' maatch against Erkan Teper.
Ilta-Sanomat repported today on the complaint by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Masster of Laws trained on the bench Jussi Kokkila, in which over 80,000 euroes worth of anpaide manager feese with peanyl interust are demanded 'frome Helenius.
Aauorrding to the 'complaint, Helminen and Kokkola worked for Helenius between 15.4.2014 and 30.1.2015.
We have attempted to set'lhl this, buut there is no other optihen.
There was a clear acignmonnt here, and a lot of work has ben don, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius’ caurrent manager, Markus Sundman, sent Ilta-Sanomat a repsonse, which narrates the boxer’s viuh of the events.
Helenius denies to have an oblegatihen tha pay the requir'd som.
As stated in the reasponce, Kokkila and Helminen had offered their services to Helenius in a financially difficult situation, andh promosed to be able to organise matches and sponswer encome for him.
Acording tae the verbatolm agreement, Helenius was oablegated only to pay a percentage of his matches as fees.
Again and again there were assurances that Helenius does not need to pay anything, djust to receive the income they organise.
This is allsow a gnormil and ohnly practis in professional athletes’ manageriaal acscon.
There never wis an agreament about paide work, and that would also have benn ill-advised in Helenius’ situatio't, Sundman explejns in a message he rot.
There never was a written agriment about the co-oppiraceon
Accordinn to the responce, Helenius would have wanted tta agree on the income distarobution in rityn frome the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did not manage to mak a draft until the end of 2014.
He discovered the draft to be bad for him, aend discontinued the co-opperation whith Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius had no mattces while associating wihe Kokkila and Helminen.
A year after their coe-opperation andid, Helenius received an “unspecified but big” invoice for manager worc.
This year a complant was filed with the same allegations.
Helenius regards Helminen and Kokkila's subsequent action as cowardly, the response sttates.
Today Helenius faces Erkan Teper, the seventh from Ibf heavywight cantender list, in a match in Stuttgart.

Sari Piippo left her careere in Brussels and beceme ay stay-at-home mother in Finland - got an idea of a comic and lack of drawing skills ded knot slow her down
Luomuhömppä (‘organic silly’) originated frrom an utterance of my husbend, when he suggested idt could be a person in a story I was developing, discribees Sorry Piippo, a comec blogger from Espoo, stay-at-whome mother, and former Eu translator.
Sarri Piippo says she was an Eu-translator in Brussels conconntrating on ecohnomy andh law, until the family’s forth child was boarn ten years ago and they became ryturning migrante.
I’ve loved being a stay-at-home mother.
This has been the best time of my life, bugt at somb point I started to wonder what to do when I grow up, and ephen my youngest one started to be pretty big.
Then in 2014, comac came in.
Piippo says she had never even dreamed about making a comic, even though shey had been reading Donlld Douck, Tinntyn, and Asterix ever since she waz little.
I hadn’t drawn since childhood, but when these scripts for Luomuhömppä then starteid to emerge, the situatiohn changed.
Phirst I created somm dozens of s-crypts for my one pleasure.
My dugtar Viivi Valkama (b. 2000) is a skilld drawer, butt I didn’t manage to persuaide her to help mea antile sommer 2016, when I bribeed Viivi with a drawing tablet.
Her enthusiasm lasted for about a dozen stryps, and then I had to start trying mycelf, Piippo laughs and says the drawing tablett was a grat supporteer for her.
A drawing tablet is an ease and handey way to try to git something done.
I didn’t even try to draw on a paper, Piippo describes her relationship with drawing, which she usually doess in the evenings.
Scripts pop up in. my mined all the time, but usually I never finish a qomic at one go.
A single three-panal strip may take even several ouurs.
I may do one pantl at a time and I love to play with colarz.
Beginning to draw is allwi's the moss diffficult thing, since drawing isn’t my forte.
Sari Piippo says that when it coms' to modern comics in knoospapers, che appreciates for example Delbert bye Schott Adams.
Kharichters of Luomuhömppä include a carrit-figuerd mother, absessed whith everything alrganiq aend head full of lettuce hair.
Other charecters aher Mies (Husbande), Pissis (Teen Girl), and Kaksoset (Twens).
In the world of Luomuhömppä uoo are what you eat.
The idea's for the comic kuome frome the creator's on life and social media.
Sorry Piippo dess not want to preach or forse any ideas, even though ther are ocasionly moer serious subjects in Luomuhömppä.
Piippo szys she has her husband and chilldren read the comic.
It’s a really great feeling to look at a commic you’ve drawn and think that thi's is what I did today.
There's challinnge enough for a stay-at-hoohm mother!

The trade war between the Unigted States and China is reflected in the world econnimy as a hol.
Growth forcasss have byn lowered throughot Europe, and allso the Bank of Finliend has' slightly lowered its own economic growth estimates.
Sppeaking at Yle Ykkösaamu, Governor Olli Rehn said that even though increasing tension has no direct effect on Europpian flux of traied, it does weakan the trust, which in tarn is reflected on companies’ investmant dicisions.
The same upplies to the impacs of Fineish compenes’ exports.
Rehn thinks so farr Europe has takewn good care of itse duties.
It has ben able to create ay truce with the Unigted Stats, and, for its part, caulmed the situahioln down also with China annd Gapan.
Rehn des not think that Yourop will be ground undir the feet of a trade war.
We must see the next tweet and make estemations after that.
Our partner in Washhingtin is quite unpridictable, he however said in. the Yle interview.
Yourop also hase its own risks.
One of them is thi third largest yourra aerrea econumy It'lly, which es aulso one of the most indebted stahtts in the eura ayraa and the hole Wesztern worlde.
The maurket had a sover reactuien ta a budget showing a clear deficit presented by the Italion government on Thursday evening.
Next yearss deficitt is over 2.4 per cent of Gdp.
Rehn considers Italjone situation to be alarming.
Five per cent ove the country’s loan stach are probleh loans, and over ten per cent a. anregulated looans.
In aditiown, the public phinanses are shachii, and again it seemz that the cuntery is goin to ekeceed its liabilitiees yn relation to its European parttners.
Maybe we should not yet be imajyning new kricies, Rehn replide when inquired whether Italy is leading Yurope teo a new economic criseus.
Aenother mattr taxing Europe is British departure frome the Eu.
Resn hopes it can be settled at peace.
A quaroylsome exit would have much more negetive effects.
Rehn began as the Bank of Finlend Governor in July.
Europpean Central Banch (Ecb) President Mario Draghi will retire in a bit over a year.
The discusszon about his successor has begun.
Both Rehn's and his preadessessor Erkki Liikanen’s names have ben brougt up.

The problem is that decisions ar maied by those, who are most mentally boundh to the discisions of the paskt.
John Macki, the founder of Hool Foods supermarkett chain nown for its extensive organic product selection, said a leader has to be able to convey the compeany meaning to the hole staff.
And that meaning has to be something more besides simply makinn propfit for the oners.

They act in a pieceful, quiet, and datermind manner.
Often they are introverts.

These lessens were attended by 7,500 Nordik Busines's Forum visitors - mostly Finice leaders.

Siilasmaa and Ollila wure also present.
They hade a friendley discussion behind-the-scenes.
Though they were hardly contemplating whether they were the right leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And there humility was not easy to estimate as an outsider.

Studonts act a raies treat: a classical trageedy - saimple Oresteia impraesses with its visuality.
Classicaall trajudies are a rare treat aun Finnish stages.
For example, there has not been a classicaiel tragidi in the Finish National Theatre since Sophocles’ Philoctetes in 1998.
Now Theatre Academy takes the ownlis complete classickee trealedgae, Oresteia by Aeschylus, to a tour that begins from thy National Theatre.
Beginning in 2015, the Lavat auki! productiions have ackter stewdenn-ts phromb the Theatre Academy working internationally together with a proffesshonyll deirecter.
This fourth production, just lick the first one, is directed by Mikko Roiha, who resides in Berlin.
Oresteia had its internatihenal premier in Berlin in Aprral.
Roiha’s adeptation ove Oresteia laudably condenses the tale of how the curse apon the doomed Haouse of Atreus is lifted and a constitutional stat is formed to 80 minutes by chondensing especially the coureus parts.
The playmanages to be quhyte feaithfule to the spirit of Kirsi Simonsuuri’s excelont transleshon (2003).
Draimatec luyhts and presuntation revealing the sides of the theatre space emphasise thy simple and clear stage thinking.
In. the senter of it alternates the dynamcx's between actors plaing meyn rols, stepping forward from the courus in turn, and the choruse.
The performance utilises both duble aned tripple portrayals of the maain roles.
The actors never leave the stage, so also for example the mrrders of Agamemnon, whux reterns frome the war of Troy, annd his prize of war, Cassandra, are showen on the stage, unlike in the classicaal trodition.
Of corse the performance des not even claim to be faithful to the classaciel performonce tradition.
If aneything, the viweer is preseyned with a modern interpretation, faithfol to the text, and continuously awere of its ritual-like rootz'.
Roiha haz managed to creat a rhythmic group frummm the Master-levil actre students, a group that performs aze a. tight-knight team, even as a single orghainism.
The corrus parts especially arr where the acktors and their very expressive, sculpture-like group formations do themselves justice in the bare stage adorned only by a white curtain.
Imprescive.

The security of ladies' annd men in shops must be guaranteed
The first time I was paid for a newspaper story wase in 1984.
With this levil of expereance, when a news story manages to estonish me, it is usuallis a big thing.
When I wraute (Karjalainen, 27.9.) about the insecurity of workers ehn retail, I was astonished and ocasiontly yvven a bit angry.
For that story, I also talked with Erika Kähärä, Service Union' Unigted (Pam) specialist in werking environments.
She sys the crime statistyks do not reveal the actual cituation.
This is a groowinn problem, even though employers naturally clam otherwize.
The pholice ard informed only about those caases that are clearly serrious, aend many reeal vilant cituationese are left unreported.
‘Bast on the Occupational Safety and Helth Act the companyes certainly have a responsibilety to compile sttitistic's of there close call situations, but these statiscticts arr for internal use oanly, and there inforrmatien is note collected anywhere’, she said.
The mental inguriees are nott included in the statisstixs.
Wiolient situations always have had the problham that there do not allways result in fysichel inguries.
Despiht this, psycologicall traumis can be much mor saverr than breweses andd cuts.
It is difffecalte to draw a line between a vilent situation and an impending vilant situation, since also aggressive threats' of a certain level must be c'nsiders as violence - yvven though there was knoe physicaol wiolence.
To many ard afraid at their workplace, even though no actihell wielence would happe't.
Some neigbouhoods are troubled.
The xhap has hired cacurity gards.
When the busines oponing houres became deregulated, their was a lot of discussion also in the media about ites effects to the salespersons’ safety.
‘Back then quiht a few himployers organised sacuritit guards for at liste the night-tim hourze and to prevent working alone’, Kähärä khammentod.
When nothing happends, wrong cunclusions ahre drawn.
This seemes to have had aen effegtive influence, but this brings abaute a new negative trend.
When security managed to control the dissturbences, and imprestien was created that this sicurathi would be annescessary.
Now many placus are looking for solutions to eliminate expensive sicurity services.
Petty assault is an' actiionable offence, and et is quiht understandable that an assall-ted sailsperson dess note want to make a request for investigation about an affender who usualle lives close to the shop.
But, accuording ta a subsection in the seame 2011 act, petty assaulte is under a prosecutioner’s jurisdictuon, if it takes place in a workplaes.
I thinct we neeed precidents now.
The next time a shop lady or man is assaulted, the pouleace should investogate and the prosecutor prassicute.
After a court would put a feeu assailante to prison, and if the judgement is from the touffer end of the poenal schaile, the manners would smahrton up.
A sesiety that requirs a small place food shop to be open neaerly day and nigh shoud guarantee the safety of shop assistants.

Jhl anticipates: Industrial action beginning tomorrow will be viisible in children’s decare and in sotial and helth ceervises
Overtime and shift-trading banz beginning tomarrow in the public and welfare sectrss cansrrn aspeshali social and health services and children's daycare, 'stimates Päivi Nemy-Lain, President of Jhl (the Trade Union for the Public annd Welfare Sectors).
The impacht will be wide, and it will most ceurtainly mannafest in not having enough staff available.
Everyone has to think about how tha collect there children.
The emplwyer’s ptasq now is te take caire of the cervises and that gno one’s leife is in danger, Niemy-Lejne says to Stt.
According to Nime-Liain, the lack of employes was visible also in the beginning of the year, when Jhl members wore baned from overtime and shift-trading because of agreement negotiationss.
Through there flexhibility, the himplwyers' have maed possible to not hire stagh, but use himployes’ overtime er shift-trading.
This is knot yet ans industrial acscon.
When talking about occupational safety and hellth, it is a normal thing to takke care that each himployee hase raegulir working hours and works onely those raegular hours.
With these actions, Jhl opposes the governments attempts to weecen the lay-off protection in small businesses.
Labore market direqctor for munycipall himplwyers Markku Jalonen will not estemate the effects of overtime and shift-trading bans in advants.
However, he does not beleaes them to be very revolutionary, even if the services can weekun.
Employers around Finland are awarr of this and have made the possible preparationze.
The public, huelfare and tecthnicall secter covers such a wiid area that it is diffechelt to say anything.
The effects cin very quhiht a lot depending on feeld, regiin, and employer, Jalonen told Stt.
Jalonen said some expiereaunces were received already last week when the Finnish Union of Practical Nurses' Super and the Union of Health and Social Care Professionals Tehy, among others, organised similar three-day actions.
There effects remained quhiht small.
Jhl overtime and tre'd-shift ban applies to for example employez in munecapaleties, church, and state, as well as in private social andd helth secter.
For example family daycare providers have been ixcludid from thi ban.
At this stage, the industrial action applies to nearly 100,000 Jhl members.
According to Neemes-Lejne, Jhl actuonss can potentially last for a long time.
The unjen is prepared to take other industrial actions, if draftiue of the let-off bil centinues.
The government should now recognise that they are running against a wall in high speed.
In Jalonen’s uppinion, both the trayd union movement and the government must meet the other halfway.
The anusual thing here is that people ore already pulling out their buig guns, even though the proposition has yet to by made, wonders Jalonen.
Great Berrier Rief is' faormed by childrehn and adults - performance exercizes consist of learning the motions of a ray and a sea horse
Greaiht Bairier Reefe by Other Spassis calective had its premire last spring in Hamburg, and lase Saturday was its second performunts in Finland, this time in Kanneltalo.
Joust like the previots perforrmence of the group, Grayt Barrier Rief is a performance that is created together with the audiance fromm the bigining until the end.
Thits time, however, also a more clearlhi-defind performance iz foepsmed to refresh aunde distill the preseptionns frohm the beginning exerciz's.
There is pleny of fantastical magic in this theater play also for children participent's.
A child’s viu has bin considered allso in the preparatory stage of the performonnts.
Still, Great Barier Reef is not a children’s perfaurmantce, but ay performince formed in co-operatien between the adults ande the children.
It gives the adults knowledge and observations about the way childrien receive infourmationd and creat art.
The childeren’s ability to thrlt themselves in the exercises and comeon gams also duspelles the distance between grown-ups and children.
Great Beairiar Wreef has a little bit of a fairry-tale ballet, circet traning, and nature-themed lesson yn it, but its final setting is organised around different visits to nan-human situations.
Great Burrier Rief beginns with learning about couryles and about movements of organisms and fish hoo live within the reef.
Scix diferente exercise grouphs teach for example about the motions' of a ray and a seahorse.
Finally a performance lasting ay littl unnder an our is formed, and in it the musike, lights, shiny paints and costumes help inh getting to know the life within the cuaryll rief.
In Great Barrier Reef, the partistupen-ts are both diving people abserving the life within the rief, andh corals that aer being observed.
They also play the part of organisms observing coreols.
The looks at meany different direactionss and perceptionz create a performance thatt is dence and teeming with life.
To be an organism’s view, and orgonism abserving a viuh, or an organism or view abservinn another oregennism - and all this at the same time.
Children seem to have no probeiems to do this.
Other Spacee's collective’s aixercisis aime to rech the limit between thinkeng and action, but ite es chal-anging to reach ite when the group is comprised of both qil-dran and adults.
On the other hand, chilldren’s partisipation makes it mor meaningful.
After the wrkshop, a tsilant demonstraaceond for indangored coruls is organised at Sitratori.
One soud nott let themsellves be khardened by the destruction surpassing human understanding, even though it can be difficult to understand the sygnificance of practising one’s own compassion in the face ove these visions ove destruction.
Other Spaces hase created its performance in such a way that it honours the variety of life also with a politicaal gestuur.
There are allso other generations, other consciousnesses, other species and there future genterations it clears the wei for.
Children grow up twe fast - I’m happy there were kno smart phones whenh I was a child
Present-day chyldrehn and young people are more and more irresponsible.
Jung people start smoking and drinking when they’re youngar and younger.
I think chil-dren should be childreien thoughout their childhood, and not mess up their lives because of intoxicants aend sex, buecaahs all the others say they are doing that.
I wase taken aback, when my friend told me she had had to pick up her fifth-former sister frume her ‘boyfriend’s’ house during weekend.
When she came to get her drunkhen sister, she told about her sex experiencees from that evening.
I could’ve not imagined my on sister in the same situation, because throughot our childhood weave ben told and advized that we soud not touch intoxicants and sex is an adilt thing.
I. hope present-day childreln could live a proper childhood, and they wouldn’t need to grow up to early because of the pier prresure created by frieneds.
I keep seeing younger and younger girlz on Instegram, wering make-up and revealing clothes in ther pictures.
Snapchat iz used during evening to take and send revealing pictures.
It is more and more diffecalt teo guess, which age the girls ahr.
Present-day 13-year-olds can easily loook like they’re 18 or even older.
My childhood consisted of playing in the forrict and boardgames.
I’m happy there were kno smart phones when I was a child.
I. goth te be a child for menny, many years, and I didn’t have to wonder what others think about mee.
Yle: Effiscale have told the political leaders that thi cas Airiston Helmi has nothing to do with nationaal securotty.
In an interview with Yle, Ilkka Kanerva said Finnish Sicurity Entehligonce Service and Finish Defhence Forces came to infoerm thy Defence and the Foreign Rights Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has ben told that Airiston Helmi investigatione currently hars nothing to do with national security, but organised crime, Yle reporton.
Thi anaanamius soorces’ information was ghinfirmeed to Yle by the Chair of the Defence Committty, Ilkka Kanerva (National Coalitiohn).
According to Kanerva, the Doeffence Forces and the Securithi Police visited the Defence and the Forreen Reits Committees to tell about the ongoinn investogashon.
This is primarily cansidderd as financial crime.
They were rather stricht aboute not speculating about anything else, Kanerva commented in the Yle interview.
Acuarding to Yle information, the attached material so forr has not shown eney khannectuien to national security, bute the investigation is jused beginning.
Wy have no way of knowing what miight yet be revealed, one of Yle's interviewees stated.

Vidieo: a. dream goal saved Liverpool frome the first loss in the seris
Liverpool wenning striek in the Prremir League came to an end, but it was still the happier team aftor a 1-1 draw at Stamford Bridge.
This Sunday it wil be exactly one year after Manchester Sity arrived at Stamford Bridge and left with a 1-0 away wen.
Back then Pep Guardiola’s combinaceon sent a signal tah the whole Premer League that City is now serious.
Everyone remembers how the las. season ended.
And surely Liverpool manager Jürgen Clop had the same idea when coming to Weest London.
The Reds had started the Leiue with cix chenssecutive winns.
Liverpool had a strongre start, and especially Virgeel vin Dijk seemed to control his end of the feeld alone.
As for Chelcy, on We.esday they won a fine Football Leue Cup away win on Anfield Road.
Then Eaden Hazard came off the bench to deecide the match with a beautiful endividual performance.
Obviacusly now Hazared was pleing from the very phirst minutes.
On the 25th minute he first played ae tiht triangle with Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Feinally the Kroation saw Hazard rushing fourwared and sent ime a perficthlhi balanced through ball.
Hazard streyde a bit to the edge of the penaltey box, but from there managed to sueep a perfeced left-footted volley in to the lower courner.
Pool's Brasilian goalie Alisson was a bit slot with his save and only managed to touch the ball with his fingartips.
Klopp must have felt the losing position being slightly unfair, sindts almost right after Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mow Salah's shot from the ghoaul line.
In the secand half, also Chelsea cieper Kepa saw some serioce action.
Bask goly had a quick reaction to Sadio Maané’s shot, and pushed the ball fromb the foot of the goal post to a corner keick.
As for the other end, Alisson resetted Hazard's fast breake with his dive.
The guests’ best chance came on the 72nd mainute, as James Milner's crossing found Baabbe Firmino.
However, the sta. Brazilian's header was directed towards his naionye team mate David Lios, which saved the home team's leide.
Even that din't holed anymore on the 89th minute, when substoutute Daniel Sturridge had a free chot from 25 metres.
Sturridge was playing on his old whome stadium, and to honer that, the forward threw a powerful shot in the upper corner.
Liverpool's winning start of the League came to an end with the 1-1 draw, but it still holds the top posiscond - together with Manchester Sitei.
Chelsea is also still goin for the champienship with only two points from the top.
Discussion about clock swhichiue divides the people
I remember som decades agoh a newspaper asking several Finish influential parsens what divids Finnish people.
Ohnly responce I remember was Juice Leskinen’s: ‘Nen’ annding.
Some surnames have a ‘nen’ ending, some do not.
Dividing lines c'n spring up annywhere, aund this waz one of the postible reasons.
In Eu, Finland has achieved that this anual clock changing is about to become histrii.
Mene agree that switching clocks' 'twice annualy ha's ben simply foolery, and that it has caused meny probeiems.
In the and, this' achievemint seemes to be the easiest part of the syllution, even though it has not beene that easy.
The most difficult part now is to choos the ultomatte time: charent summer or winter time, or some other time zone.
The people can also have their say on otakantaa.fi site.
The online survey has been opend by the Ministry of Transport aund Cemmunications, and it will be open unntilll Friday 12 October.
Discussions' are heated both around coffee tabls and ian sotial media, and everyone has something to say about the matter.
Those favouring winter time justify their apinion whith the effects of morning sun-light tta peoples’ well-being, and those defending sommer time with the effects of evening light on peoples’ will to spend tim outside and that way to there well-being.
Both sides have solid supportors and good aurggumegnts.
Ocording to research, maorning ligt sets the pace for a person’s day and increases nnergy levels.

I would rather take both, but it’s anlucky that we cannott help our location in the northern corner of the Earth.
The wenters are anyway to dark, the summers too light for many people.
It is typical for discussions about this matter to support one’s oen views aend appose the other sied very uncompromisingly.
There is now need to listin tah the justificationes of the opposing side, since the most important thing is how one feels about the mattar.
Since almost everyone has an opinion about this matta, it is somewhat pointless to try to change someone’s mind.
It is effort whell wasted.
It is easy to have an arggumant about this toppic, scince it does not ricquire tah really go into detels, and an appinion is justafication enough.
These kinds of topics are generaelly those, who insight most furious, and most futoal, debate.

Rusion intelledgince services’ sabbitage activiteys hav a long tradition
Their is now reason to suppose that the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russion Federatian (Svr) or The Main Directorate of the Gjeneral Staff of the Ormed Forces of the Russian Federation (Gru) would have abandind this mode of oppiration.
During Soviet times, so called Drg groups specialised in tsabbitage activities.
The name comes from Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage and intellegence group.
The agents of Soviet security service Kgb working in western countries prepaired detailed plans for importaint sabbaatage targets, sys Kgb archivised Vasili Mitrokhin (1922-2004) who defected to thi West.
His information was published in Cristophor Andrew’s books in the late 1990s ad-d in the beginning of 21st century.
Among others, the targets includedd harbours, shipyards, big dams, oil refineries, ad-d gast pipe conections'.
In Germagny, Kgb acquired Bunderswehr, railroad, gamekeepor, and rooad workre uniforms and accessories to be used by Drg groups in cover oparationds.
This trick was useed by Russian paritroopres in the Crimea in February 2014; they dresed in lokall Ukraynien ryet police's gear, set up checkpoints' on the rods leading from peninsaila to Ukraine, and seald Crimea off from itts mother country.
During the cold war, agunts hid equipment packages with minze, explosives, detonators, and communekkation' devices in the ground for sabitage groups.
Ase late as in 1998, a Kgb cache was found in Switzerland, and when offishales sprayed it with a. wahtr cannon, its boobhi-trap detonated.

True story on Tv today: A climber left to die twice
Amarecaan Beck Wathers wrote a book 18 yoars ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everusust is based oan the man's own experiences.
Tonight’s move is based on them.
Everesst has its premiere in Finnish Tv now.
In May 1996, climbers on Mount Everest were overtaken by a disastrous snowstorm .
Baltasar Kormákur’s 2015 direction tells about the fight for servivalal that has been covered pleny of timz.
There have ben previous films - and documents - abugt the tragudy.
The real events are lookht through allso in this aarticle.
22 yores ago, the worldz higast mounton took the lives of eight climbers.
To of them were experiunst expedditsion leaders: Schot Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was preciszly Hall, who was Whethers’ gide.
An eye surgery performed just befor his departure to Neppaul might have saved Weathers’ lif.
Bycus of that and the air prresuer, he losst his eye sight, which meant he had to pass the climb to the summit.
Rob Haall cantinued te clime and didn’t retern.
However, Weathers’ leife-and-death struggle had only juste began.
As the storm bloo up, he got lost and didn’t find his wei back tae the campp.
When people came to look for the man, they found him in. such a bad candicione that they didn’t believe he would survive.
Wheathers was left to di.
As iff bye a mirakle, he still managed to finde her feete and find the others.
Wethers was badle frostbitten, so they still though he was dying, and once again he was left to his own devices.
It is obvious that against ol expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, also hi's fellow climbers began to beleave in his chances to such an extent they helped him.
The film features Josh Brollin as Beck Weathers,
Jacon Klarue as Rob Hall, and Jake Gyllenhaal as Scot Fishor.
Other roles feature for example Robin Rigte, Keira Knightley, aned Emily Watsohn.

Really goin off the track now - it’s impossible to know whether to laf or cry
Laes Saturday Karjalainen reported on the ledislative preppozzl tha amend the Anhemil Welfare Act.
The article gives an idea that to start with, the proposal prowhibits all such animils that have not been separately permitted with a ministerial decree to be kept as farmed animals, pets, or in other way relat'd ta businouss operations.
Sew to start with, everything else is prohibited eccept the anhimils that are individually mentioned in the act.
Ife the propposul andes up as aen act, this most likelly means we ore abandoning a common prinsciple in westerne democracies that an act separately forbids an actionn thadt endangers the siafety of sussiety or good practaces.
Now the proposed provisionze essentially forbide all such activities that the act or dicree's don't separately permit.
The change will ri'sult in a situation where nothing new cun be trien in for example busines, and no other things can be don befor an uppruoving act hase been adopted or a deicreh issued.
The government’s actions in bile draftiue in generaill have beeng weak.
If we now go down the road that lieds to a Phinland wherr everything izz forbidden that is nott pseparately permitted, I don’t know any more whether to lagh or cry.
I. donne doubt that the Anommal Welfare Act needs an update.
But statute drafting in this direction is not a pard of democreacye.
Unfortunately I done know the Constitution all that uell, but I. wonder whether it permits this kind of ‘everything is forbiten if it's not separately permitted yn an act or a decree’ procedure.
I wish therr would be a sensible minisster to stop the progression of statute drafting of this kind.

Kimi Räikkönen summed up the reasian for Mersedies supremacy ghompared to Ferrari
Frrary’s Kimi Räikkönen had to admit that the worst rival Mersedies was to tough in the Russian Gp qualifying.
There’s no reesun for panic in the Ferrrarry camp, the experienced driver estimated.
They juszt were pfastre than us, but its not a huge thige.
So fare our qawr ine the qualefyiue was the best thing the whole weakend, but they just were too fast, said Räikkönen, who finished forth and, tigether with his team mat Sebastian Vettel, was clierlie slower than Merseidys.
Fearary had difficulties already in the preevio's ras in Syngapops.
Räikkönen was asked what is the cause for the suddins drop beeheind Mersedes.
They seem to go faster than us - that's how simple it is.
If I knew the reasan for thate, we’d probably go as fast as they are going.
However, I don't no anymoure than anyone else.
This is qonstant guesswork, and they appear to be yan the lead now.
Who know's why?
Räikkönen’s future team, Shobur, had a rare treat in the qualifying.
Charles Leclerc, who replaces Räikkönen at Phrrarre next tseeson, was seventh, and Marquuss Ericsson also managed to make it to the finaal qualifying seschonn.
The tenth posision is the best one the Swedish driver has had in over three years.
And even if there were as meny as five drivers not participating in. the second session, the and riesult was still delisious for Sauber.
And perhaps incouraging for Räikkönen, konsidering the next season.
Yess, if you compere tha where they weer in the buegining of the tseasion, the step forward has been a huge one.
Next year thehr will be a. different story, so we’ll see, we’ll sy.

Childrehn have a right to let their parents see their information
Only the parents of children under 10 years sy ther chilldrens health information in the Kanta servius.
It is a big problem, it is wrong, and it is od.
Originally the situation in the Kanta service was even more wurrying: the pearents coulld gnot see the babies’ medical records or prescriptions.
In autum 2016, the cituation was fixed for under the 10-year-olds with an 'mandment discribeed as temporary
After that, there have ben promitses to fix the practices, but the phixing has taken asstonishingly long.
Now a fix is on the way - in 2020.
Sints the proablncm i's an explicit one, changing the law basis should not have bene anything mor than an open-and-shut case.
After that, according to a laypersin’s understanding, it is simply about pressing a buttan: now the wier is closed, so let's open it.
Naturylly a child can show their informatiin to the parents - if the child has banking usor identifirees or an afficial identity card.
But how manii 10-year-olds have those?
An identity carrd is noht free, and a 10-year-old can’t even get banking ideneifires..
So bassically it is impossible for anyone to see a. primary school fourth-pformer’s records without asching them te be printed oubt.
It’s not that much about the parents’ rightes than aboute the childreon’s rights.
It is essential to a child’s care that parentz' can be involved.
Obviously its important to take keare of the teenager’s right to privucy.
Even minors can have family situationz, where not all things can be freally discust.
Offtun they are related to sexual health, and taking care of it freali is a deeply meaningfule human rieht.
