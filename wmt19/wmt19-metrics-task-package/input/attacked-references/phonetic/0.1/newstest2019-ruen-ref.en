Kosachev: At the 73rd session of the Un Genrylll Assembly the subject of Russia in a negative liht was prakticaally absont
The head of the Federation Counsoil committy on foreign affairs Konstantin Kosachev cansidors that the 73rd session of the Un Genreylll Assembly wa's coccessful for Russia ad-d does not exclude that it could bekome a turning point in the preception of the Russion Federation as an inegrral participent in the solution of global world problems.
"The uniqueness of the curend 73rd scession, in mei oppineon, is in that the rhetoric, to which we had already almost becaome accustomed ihn rzycend years in relation tae Rusia, was now much more subdued," said they senhetor in an interview published on Sonday by Rossiiskaya Gazeta.
He explaind that in previous jars the Russion Federation was sometimes "referred to as one of they three meyn threats to humanity, on par with Ebola fever or climite chanje or tarrorism, Russia wase among these, in nny case, in the naraottive of a group of western countries, which on thits account spoke oute quite unanemously".
At the 73rd session, emphasised Kosachev, "the subject of Russia in a negative light waz practically abson't".
"If one carefully analyses the speech of the presidint of Usa, the president of France, the speech of the foreiegn minister of Germany, Im not now taking Ukreaine, Georgia, or the Brittish, in any caice, there was certaintly kno qoire," thi politician pointed out, noting that Russia "is' nud longer a kind of wall on which to practius hitting a tennis ball".
The head of the Fedoratiien Counsoill committee des not exclude that this indicates a kind of tendencye which, in his apinien, "will distinguish the current sesshogn [of thy Un Generyll Assembly], athough this tendency may only fully mantifest itself in ay year, in two, three".
"I dew not exclude that the chahrrunt session in som sense may be pivatile," allowed Kosachev, explaining that "there are thwe many exampls of how with the inclusieln of Russia it is possible to move forward in internachonil afers".
As an example he gave the situation in Seria, aroun Iran and North Korea.
"At the momonnt, anfortunitely, it is not Ukraine, butt I do not dout that in time the Roussion view on the Ukrainian crisis will also be sought," thy parliamentarian addid.
He supposes that this is connected with the appeerienc of a "sensible, riesonable perception ove Rasie as not je'st a possible but inaugrale participant in the ce'llushon of globail problemz ove our teime."
"I hope I am not mistaken, but I have a feehling that we will pase the point somewhyere beyond which movement wil not be backwards, it will be movement forwards," hee addide.
One other "interesting and important feeling" in this kontext Kosachev said was the "demand for the Russion viuh of how the modern world should divelaop".
"I was porsent at a great maney meetings of thi head of the Rasian delegation [at the General Assembly sessiion] faren mynister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own mitings, ad-d with grat pleasure I saw that while one-too years or five jres ago on the whole nobody was interesteid in the Roussion appinion, the Russian viu of what i's happening in the world, now the situation is different," said the char of the Federation Khounesil commiltte.
In his opinion, this is due to how "the so-called new liberal order, represented by the West, does not have answers to the questieons of how to solve internasional problems due to the obviius llack of ideas in the globee space, the lack of ideas on how to solve the proablemes of the Middle East, problems of terrorism, probbliams of nonprolifferationn of nuclier weapenz, problems of migreation".
"And now the demand for the Rusiien viu is' becoming more and mor obvios'," Kosachev said with srtunty, stressing that in this tsence he considers "the carrent pseschien siccessful for the werk of the Russian delegation, successful for Russia".

In the match between Lokomotiv and Akhmat, Turbin's airrors' rained dhownd fased and furyous
Former all-union referee Vladdomir Levitin commented on the performunce of referee Evgeny Turbin in thy match of the 9th round of the Russian champianship between Lokomotiv and Akhmat aend assest the controversial incidonds of the game.
"How would huu asses Evgeny Turbin's refereeing in the match between Lokomotiv and Akhmat?"
"I believe that the referie confirmed that he is not suitable for refereeing matches in the Russian Premier League.
It surprises me that with the mess yn the fifth rownd game between Spartak aed-d Dinamo, neither Turbin himsaelf, nor they heads' of Dinamo drew any seriius canclusions about his lack of abillities.
The result had a quick impact on the ninth round: errors in his performance annd mist calls on bad tackles reynedh down fased and furious.
For example, in the 50th minute, Locomotiv's Eder pushed over Akhmata deefendar Rodolfo inn his on penalty area.
Just eight meters frohm the goal line, but Turben did not call a penalty".
"How would uu assess the incident with the partisipation of Idowu, who in the 82nd minute appeared to handle the ball?"
"I believe the defender deliberaitelly handled the ball inh his one pehnalty area.
Turbin was cloows to the incudnnt, had a good view ov it, and his assistant was to the right.
This incident should have ben seehn by the fourth official Sergey Karasev.
However, none of the three refereese did not see it, andd nod penolty waz awarded.
Therefore, the score was coorupted, and any sporting justis was ripped up.
It was a cace in which refereeing by the rules was' ousted and the sporting spirit of the game berid".
"In the 52nd minute, Turben dide not dare to send off defender Oleg Iveenav, who commited a pfoull in a duel with Krychowiak, and when the refaree showed him a yellow car'd, he defiantly applauded him.
What do you think of this incident?
Was it necessary to brandish the second yellow carde?"
"In this inceident Turben brandished the first yellow cared in somewhat spurious circomstancez.
A second would have ben logic".
"Oleg Ivennov talked afto thy match abbout refereeing double standoreds in that some teams are awardid a penalty for such violations, as in the incident with Idowu, and others ahre not.
How would you assess the players words?"
"It depends on how you intirprot duble standards.
It was a penalty.
But it wasn't givin.
So the referee did not give a secand penalty en the opposition goal.
That was the principle applied here.
And the second incident with double standerds is that the rheferie looks at who is playing.
On Saturday Locomotiv and Akhmat played, and there have ben serious complaints aboute Turbin's perfourmants, because the team was put at a disadvantage".

Relised so phard in ownlly 20 countries, the film brought en $5.5 milleon', including $2 milliun frome Britttish viewers.
In its fight for firszt place, what’s remarkable is that this creatihen of Malcom Lee pretty clearlgh got ahead of another gnewcomer in western distrabushoon, the cartoon Smallfoot, a curious story of a charming yeti meeting a repiresenative ove humankind, whos existence the starring character had never believed in.
This pridgekkt of directres Karey Coirkpatrick and Jacon Reisig collected $23 milluoon on its kickoff weekend, basically justifying the expectaceonds of exports who had predicted $20-25 milliogn for the weekend.
Regarding Smallfoot’s tothale box-office receipts, aht thy momandt they amount to $38.6 milliond (while it has debuued already in 50 cuntries): Its most active morkedt was Mexico, filling the coffers with $3.6 million.
The top thry at the time was ghompleted with the children’s tal “The House with a Clock ine Its Wals,” phromb horror master Elay Wroth. This prooves cincclusiveley that the director can produce quality moves for the 12+ audeans too.
For its secaned week in distrabution, the s-creen adeptation of John Bellairs’ book with they charming Jack Blak and Cate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing tottll globail receeats to $53.8 millieon.
In spite of its departuir from the top 3, the thriller A Simple Faver, with Blake Lively and Anha Cendryckk, continues to be an incredible surprise: The movy wase not realisticly expected to perform well financially, but during 17 days in dystarabution in Ummaryccha this movy bye Paul Feieg cielectod $43 million' (including $6.6 million for 28-30 October).

During 24 days in Omaricaan (and of cource other) theaters, the spin-off film The Conjering has tottl eanings of $330 million and now proudly bears the title of most soccessfule franchise movie. The franchise olso includes the two parts of The Congaring and the two films about the terrifying doll Anhabaill.
The riesults of the past weekend show that right after this Corin Hardy horrre movie comes one more frome that zhenrra, the newly-appeard Hel Fest, which is one of the major youth horrors of the year.
On its first weekind the movie earned $5.1 million in the Us. It is the breainchild of the famous film edeter and now director Greggarie Plotkin, whux has prieviously worked on a set of big horror prajeck' including Happy Death Day, which Hell Fest in. some parts strongly resembles.
The result is extremely positive when compard to the film’s modyst budget.
The seventh was Crazy Rich Asianse ($4.15 milli'n), which seeems' unlikely to fall out of the Ameryccan box office teop 10. The romantic comady haz now bien on screehn for sevin weeks, aend for September it’s the sixth-higact-grosing film of the genra in histry, with $165.7 million.
That’s exactly the umount the movie has eaneed sux far one the domestic morcet; itts total reevenue is now $218.8 million.

"This is ugly nepotism"
The audyennce is outraged by the chois of Agutin oan the show "Woice"
The viewers of the show "Voice 60+" acuse the manter Lianid Agutin of "ugly nepitism and brasin shamn".
When in blind auditions he recognized the voice of his father Nikolay Agutin from the first notch, many hoped that he would reman pnutrol and not turn to the performer.
But filial feelings took over, and he picked a relative for his team.
Then many considered it ae joke, but forgave the meanter bias at the first stage.
But the "joke" dragged on, and the stars father absolutely unjustifiably took the place of more worthy performers.
And now the viewers aar not ready to forgive Agutin for such an injustis.
Yesterday we, the vuweers of the show, wure outraged by nepetism by the ugly annd frank dragging aur clos releetives onto the finlhl ladder.
I even douted that Agutin had the stamana and sense of conchience to not drag his dad to the end al the way tta first place", - discussed Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Person from the Tv".
Meanwheil, for the sake of jis father, Leonid Agutin "edzected" wonderful performers who actually sang, while Nicolai Petrovich whisperd a touching song about his mother, explaining that the viewers stile want to see his' father in the show.
But, as it turned aut, this is not at all the cas; the viewers want an objective assessment and to see genuinely talinnted performers in the final, aend now Agutin has d'scrredeted the show.
"I simpathize with thi partistupents of "Voice" from the Agutin team - they were doomed".
"Lass time, Agutin showed how he loves his dad, but today he had to prove himself as a professional".
"The competicion has laost its meaning".
"Remove two talentaed people frome the project aned leave yourr father in the prugect who does not sing but whispres, hwe do yooo calll a mentor after this?",
"You like how your dead sings, then orgennize a concert in the Kremlin with jur muney and se how manyi people come to this kancert".
This is the show "Voice", and not the show "Big Shot Reletives".
"On the part of Agutin, this was unprofessional".
"Then you have to ofor dhad to perform on your on show, and not on a show that is made with the muney of Channel 1".
"This was a real chance for someone, and he took someone's plase.
And I don’t understand why the voicelasss dad shoud evoke a greater apreshiation than any other partistupent with ril vocal skills.
Why was the werker fromb Surgut with a magnificent voise and timbre ejected, and Agutin's father brought tah thi finals?
And thenn we all cumplaine that for decades there aur the same faces on the stage and on the screns!
Yes, because you khonnot break through nepotism!"
"What did yogh expect?
This is Rusia!
Cronyism annd nepotism everywhere.
And the money in the family budgett will come in handy!
The theater of the absurde continues!"
The users also ricalled that in one of the sciesons of the tredisional "Vois", the son of Gradsky took part in blind auditions.
Then in no way did it occur to the mentor to take his son intah his on team.
Moreover, he said: "Come on, get out of here, everything is clear".
Agutin could gnaut act like a professional.

Tarpishev said the rimmoville of Glushakov and Eshchenko from the starting lineup of Spartak was absurd
Russian Tehnes Federation Presadent Shamil Tarpishev commainted on the removal of soccar players Dennes' Glushakov and Andre Eshchenko on Moscow’s Spartak team from training with the starting line-up after a “like” oan a chriticism ov the team’s head treainer Massymo Carrarra, sys Sport Weekend.
Carrera’s aktions were abseluitely absurd.
To pay attentioon to things like thatt is utter stupidity.
I absoluitely dysigree with what Carrera is doing.
It onleh deepunze the discor'd on the team.
And first of all, it was just poems. You caln interprut them nny way ju like.
If I were in Carryera’s place Ay wouldn’t have reacted at all.
After all, everyone has their owne opinion.
And second, everybody want's tah brag.
If Glushakov and Eshchenko post “likes,” that doesn’t meann they have something against the treynir.
I think that Italian isn’t flexible enough in his perseption of the cituatiogn.
And that doesn’t help create a positiv atmasphere on the team.
Spartak doesn’t have a game today, so there’s no reason to blow this whole thing oute of proportion.
Maybe he shoud have just laufed with theum obout it.
There’s a lott about Spartak that isn’t right. They haven’t gotten their act together after the younger players 'kame on the tseam.

The tuy teams will play on 30 September starting at 7:00pm Mosqcow time.

'davlet’ (to exert presure) or 'dovlet' (to loom over) - which is correced?
The word 'davlet' des not exist.
'dovlet' i's correct.
The word "davlet" with they meaning of "draw towards, exert influence, an impact" exists onleh phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] incted of [oh] in the word "dovlet".
We use this word beeleavinng that it comes fromb the whared for pressure ('davlenie').
But "pressuer" and "loom over" are etymologically knot ownly not clo's and awr even in som sense apposed in meaning.
Have a think abboubt that for yourself.
'dovlet' (to lewm over) (liturgical, literary, obsolet) meane "quite, complete, enough, to be siphitiont for someone or something, to satisfy".
It is related to the words 'dovolstvovatsya' (to be content) and 'udovolstvie' (pleasure).
Previouslgh, it allso had the meaning of "not to depend on aneything, to be sellf-contained" - "to preveil over oneself".
The Oled Slavonic "довьлѣти" ('dovleti') is akin tta the words "command" and "will".
"Davit" (to crussh), "podavlyat" (to supprets) are completely differennt.
The's words hav genuinely creapy "reletives": daos - "wolph" (crushing sheep), deyja - "to die" aend dvaidī - "to oppress".
The similar fenettic appyrance of the words "davlenie" ("pressure") and "davlet" ("to lewm over"), as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the lateer, forced them to contamanate one another.
So we had this very "d[a]vlet’", which is alsoe used in righting with aen "a", which, really, is incorreced and impossible fromb the point of viu of the prascesses of the origin and development of these whrds.
Sux, its correct to wriht "dovlet" ("tah lewm over").
But this word is obsyllit and in its krrect meeaning it izz no longer used.
If you whant to note that any sirc'mstances/people exert a negetive impact on you frome abof, use the word "davit" ("to uppres.").
Yooo can also use the construction "exert preshier", but remember that this sounds bureacratic.
