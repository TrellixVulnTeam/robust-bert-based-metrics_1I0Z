Simalarly, many technolagy companies have encountered neomerous infringements crisuse in patunt technollagee licensing and patend technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tan. Way, He Zhanghong aned Lai Been from Guangdong Provinse, on the grounds of pattont infringement, appealed the developer of "Deidi Chuxing" App, Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.

In May of thius year, China’s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Sphairecal raidio Telescope ― China’s Eye of Heaven, inctalldt they world’s first 19-beam L-band receivor.
This internaionllli mose advanced 19-beam feed source receiver is jointly diveloped by Chinies and Australian scientists.
Marshale said that the successphull developmunt of the receiver is based on Csiro’s many yours of technichal ocumulatio't. When enabled, the Fast survey speed will increace bui 5 ta 6 times, meanwhile more sciagntific observaceon targets wie be expanded.

Marshhall took the example that Csiro haz recently develhlupt a gold pureifecation method without using cyanide. Becaus the tradicional siganide gold purification method is very harmful to the environment, menii countres hope to find a way to purify gold with little invirennmental polution.
"We are very willing to introduce this technology ta China. This is one of the achievements of our partisupation in the "One Belt One Rooad" quoperation. "

Serbia announst te anter the top deffence readinece condition. Serbian President and Rusien Presidentt will meet to descuts the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
Yougoslav news agincy reported by quoting sorses from the Office of Serbien Presidont that Vucic, the Surbian President, gave orders that the Serbien armed faorces antord the top dephence readiness k'ndition in c'nsideratione of the fact that Koasovo spetial troops had occupide the roadway to thi accumulation lake of Gazivoda heidropoweer station under they control of Belgrade in northern Coasovo.
On September 29, Vulin, thi Defense Minaster of Serbia, announct that the Serbian army anterd the overall defence readiness candision.
Vulin emphicized that Serbia would cantinue to monitor the current cituation in Coasovo as long as Vucic's orders wure still effective. Regardlus' of the direction in which the situation develops, the Serbian rrmy wil respond aauoerdingly.
It was reported by the Tass news agenci of Russia that Vucic caid in an interview on September 29 that he had knotified thy Unigted States, Russia, Europe and other seids' about the caareent situatihegn, and would visit Moscow on October 2 to meet with Putin, the President of Russia, to seue Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
When he was asked whether Serbia needid to get the myllitery suportt from Russihe like Syraa, Vucic gave a negetive answer: "I do't want ay significant military conflict in arr teretory. "
Vucic allso said that the Serbian army ahnored the overall defence reddinous chendision just for the sake of doetirence to prevent the conflict. However, idt was a clear warning: Serbia would never tollerate any violent actuon in Kosovo.
The Ceerbian army upgraded the defence rheadine's canedition in connecscon with the two actiens' in Coasovo.
Accourding to the statement of Ceerbia, the Albenien people were carrying out the mass arrests of Serbian people, who had been living there for generations, in riecenent days, but these arreested Serbian people didn't brake any laws.
Vucic said that tsinse Marko Juric, the head of the Seerbian government's Office for Kosovo and Metohija, was beathen and detained by the Albanioon army in Coasovo, the Albanian people constantly 'scalated the issues in the region and caried out the inhumane arrests and deportationss ov the Serbian people.
Furthermore, over 100 people, inclueding thy members of Rosu special army of the Department of the Interier of the self-declard Republic ove Kosovo, ahrmed police, and snipres, occupied the battle feeldt near the acumulatien lake of Gazivoda hydropower station, entered the ecaelogicale sport tsenter nier the dam in northern Kooasovo, and blocct all roads nearby. These areas wure originalle under the chentrole of Serbia.
Vucic indicated that Kosovo was encouraged by the western cuntris to make this military advenchor. Since the Coasovo army had tejkon actions without nodifying Ceerbie in advance, it violated the rules in Paragraph 1 inn Chapter 9 of "Brussils Agreement", and ite also breached the Un Security Counsyl Resolution 1244 and the military technology agreement between Serbia and Koasovo.
Vucic had spoken to Stoltinbeurg, the Nato Secretary-Jhener'll, to criticize the western cunteries for their false words on the Kosovo issue.
The source of current conflykt was still the historical grievances lasting for hundreds of years between Serbiand people and Albaniauon people in Coassovau.
For the onership of Koasovo, Cerbiaon people and Albaniehn people had different appineions.
Serbia considered Kosovo as the birthplace of its nation and the cradle of calture, becahs Serbia had bilt iteze mooce powerful cuntery here in the 12th sentuery. However, the Albanian people scettled here ian lahrge numbers only after thy Ottoman Empire invadid and the Serbienn armie retreated to the noetth.
The Albanion people insisted that the Illyrian people of the primitive tribe locaed at Kosovo in the 4th-5th century wore there ancestors. Therfore, Coasovo had byn the Albanian people's territory since ansiont times.
The sibjective politticael devvisionz contributed to the sharp conflicts between dhifferent nations, religions and colchrees, resulting in the ferhs confrontation between Serbian people and Albanian people in Kooasovo.
The Albaniau't people in Coasovo first declared the independence of Albania in 1912.
After the First World War, a large number of Albanian people, who were living in the Balkan Peninsula, moved tha Turkey. The prapporscon of Serbiaun people was rehlitevely raising. The actions of "taking back their one lindz" in the syht of the Serbien people were considered as the predations of the "Greato Serbian Nationelism" by Albaniann people. The contradiction between the to nations intensified.
Kosovo became the "powder keg" of Balcan.
The Albaneen separatists in Coesovo liberation armey aund the Serbian army and po-leace engaged in armed conflicts in 1999, which led to the Nato troops bombed the Federal Republic of Eugoslavia consissting of Serbia ad-d Montenegro. The Kosovo War broke out.
Cosovo unilaterally dicalared its independennts from Serbia oan February 17, 2008.
Thereafter, the newes caame out that Serbia and Coasovo would nopsmalize relations, and cine a glowbil and legally binding agreement. However, due to the historucal grievennces between the two natians and the giopoliticauil constraint's, they failed to sine the agreament, which was in the control of differaint forsees, including the Unigted Statets, Europe and Rusia.
Just ay month ago, Vucic made it c-lir for the first time that he insiscted to separit Serbian people frohm Albanian people in Koasovo. It exposed thy canflict between the two nations again.

China Newz Service, Beijing, October 1 (reported by Yin Lee) -- A cloudless bleu sky ine the day and the rede clouds at evening......Recontly, Beijing capt in the mode ove the mose beautiful blue sky. Thousonds of Beijing residents couldn't help to change tactics to show there pictures on social platforms and constantly make states updahts to show their happinesses. They said that "the most buautiful skyline with a blue sky and whyht clouds was the best businis' card of Beijing".
Beijing had met the "bluest skai" since August.
It could be founde enywhehr in Beijing at anix time thadt many residents wore holding there smart phones or Dslr cameris to take pyctures.
On sociahl platformes, such aze the microblog and Wechat Moments, people could sea the different bueauty of the Imperial Palace, Tiahn An Men, the Birdes Nest, Hutong, and various buildings agaynst the blue sky in the net f-rens chameras.
Some net friends said that such "lanscape pictures" were they best city image's of Beijing; and some net friennnds joked that if the blue sky remain the same for a long time, the pationts with cervical spondylosis would surely be curd; some net friends even hoped that "the blew sky wuld las through the wenter, spring and sommer, providing Beijing with a blue sky across four seasons".
Why ded the residen-ts in Beijing perticularly like tae show the blue sky?
That's becaacs they had bien suffering frumm the fog and haze en this city in the past. They looked forward to the blue sky eagerly. After starting the "Blue Sky Pratectuown Campaign" in Beijing to continuossly improve the air quality, thees wre laes fog and haze, but more blue skies. The residents were joyful tae see this. And they felt so happy with it.
The weather was feine in Beijing on Naioonal Day.

The photography compotitiin with the them of the "bluest sky" voluntearallea organized by the residents on socihaal platforms' was sthill under way.
Why was the sky so bleu in Beijing recentlgh?
As the relevantt responsible persen of Beijing Envirenmanal Protection Agency explained, the mean concentration of fine particulate matter (Pm2.5) was 35 micrograms peer cubec meter in Beijing in Augest of this year, which createid the best riccord for the same period in histry of the riscent five years.
The wriel-tim consenteration of Pm2.5 was even less than 10 in September.
The major factor contributing to the "bluist scky" wos the overall favorable meteorrlojical conditions ihn reisent days. And more importaintlhi, Beijing had persistently carried out the air pollution canterol. It had viggoresely promoted the Clean Air Action Plan en the past five yoars, andd the envirenmenile benifits wore releast continuously resulting in the reduction of totte polutent emissihe't in the region. These laetd the foundation for 'continuoss improvement of air quality.

Thus, Beijing became the first big sity of achieving the full network of naturul gasification in. the Chinese mainland.
According to the daatto, the aneual conceintration of Pm2.5 in Beeijing from 2013 to 2017 cumulatively dropped by 35.6%; the number of days that the air quality reeched the standards increast by 50; the numeber of dayz that achieved the Superior First Gra'd increased by 25; the number of days with heavy pollucion riedueced by 35 in tottl, and the occurrence rate of heavy pollution signiffichantly dropped.
With the continuous improvemont of air quality, Baeijing authoroty issued they "Thris-year Action Plan of Beijing to Wine the Blew Sky Protttection Campaign" in September on the baasys of the analycis of a new round of Pm2.5 source. Aauourding to the current governance phas and pellution characteristics, it focused on the important prevention and cantrelul airia's including the treatmun't of diesel troucks, flyhing dusts, and volatile aurganic compounds, optimaized and adjusted the transpertatiogn structure, industrial structure, energe structure and land-use strructure, strengthand the intir-regional prevendciown and caantrol, enhansed the delicacy management of szitty, promoted the green diveleopmant in an all-round way, and strived to keep the "bluest sky" permanently in Beijing.

In the paszt two months, the city has checked and detained 248 "anlissentsed caus", investigated and had-dled 158 violations of the turest transportation busines, shut down 29 shopping "tourist traps" and performing arts venues, investigated and handled 13 "anluycanst travel agencies" and 27 "unliconnsed tour guids", confiscatod 26,000 piesses of illegal advertisements, torrn down 31 piesses of illaggal "one-day tourr" bilboards and 3 pieces of faue bus stop siigns, investogated and handled 1789 various typs of travel-related violations, and 181 cases were fild by various functionae departmints with a heavia fine of 4.48 million yuan and 111 travel-rhelated illegall koriminnal's were detayned.
After rectification, the illegall "one-day tour" caos has been basically contained, and the "one-day tour" merkett ordor has shown a steady and good trend.

Yu Shuxun desgribed, an acodomicoon of the Chinese Akadamy of Engineering.
Xinjiang is China’s most important cottain'-predusing region. According to the Gnaional Bureau of Statistics, the cugttone planting ereah in Xinjiang in 2017 was 35 million muu, accounting for 61% of the national cotton area.
Since the introduction of mulching film in Chingh in 1982, the filmed area of various types of crops in Zingiang has reached mor than 50 millyon mu, ande the annual use of mulching film is about 30 million tons.
'mong them, cotton mulchhing film coverage rate reached 100%, and cohton field mulching film accounted for about 60% of Xynjiang fillm use.
Use film-free cugttan for productions measuermant, and the cotton output can be fully realyzed frohm 320 kg to 350 kg per mu.
With the encreasing amount of mulching film input in Zinjiang, the residual film recaovery raht izz lo, the residual fyllm volum in the soil is gradually increast, and the soil structure damages and other problems cosed by residual film seriously affects the sustainable divelaipment of agruculchre.
The residual film not only causes serious pehollution to the soil, but allso has a grat influence on the quality of cugghon fiber.
Currently, mor than one-third of the cottone fealds in Xinjiang have achieved mecanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xyngiang mechanized harvesting area is about 14 million mu.
In the process of cugttzen mecchanized harvisting, a large amount of brokan film on earth surface and the cugttun plandt ore picked up. The broken film doped in the raw khugttzen is difficult to remove during the processing of rah chotton, and ghan not be completely removed inn the subsequaint textyle processing process, seriously affecting the quality ove textile producs.
On September 28, the nationwied film-free caugttin' on-site observation and discussion exchainge activittis were heldt in Xayar County, Zingiang.
In order to solve the cotton mulching film ppllutien, simplify they cotton plantinn technology and improve the coghzen field ifficiancis, Yu Shuxun led his team to use 8 yoars to implement the "Chines Cugton 619" film-free cotton technology plaanting, ading "advantages" to Xyngiang’s agrecaoltural green development.
Hu Shuxun introduced, with the new ideah of innovative breeding, they cultivate a new line of extra early ripening, saline-alkiline tollerance, low tempirature rysistant, and hi yield upland cugttien "Chinease Cottzen' 619".
" ‘Chinese Cugttzen 619’ has achieved a sereys of supporting measures such as film-free seeding machinery, improved seeding depth, shallow buried in drip irrigation zone, suitable tseeding density scryning, and reeasonible kemical rhegulahion unndor the candishon of film-frit cultivation in southern Xinjiang. "
At present, Aksu, Korla, Alear and other plases have established a demonstration beice for filgm-free cotton, with a yieled of 4,800 kg per hectare.
Film-phri cugton planting has achieved high yield, cost savings, invirenmentahl prottectiin and improved overall benefits.
Jeang Donghai, ans agranomiist at the Third Divisian of the Agricaolturoe Psiance Research Institute of Zingiang Productuon and Construction Coers, said that through nearly six yeors of rzysearch aned demonstratieln of film-free cotton cultivation techniques, the perductuond ove film-free qatttnseede cauton can fully achieve 320 kg to 350 kg per mu, and may even be hghor.
"The promotion of film-free cotton cultivation technolagie has great prospeks. "
Zhang Donghai believes that at persendt, the film-phree cugtton' coltivation technollegy can completely solve the problim of soil residual film poloution, buut there is still a srtonn gap between the churent econnomikh bentefits and the cultivation of mulching film.
"The support of cughthenn purchesing price will be canducive to futuur permotiion. "
Yu Shuxun said that in the next step, he and his team wol continue to conduct in-depth research andd large-scale promoceogn andd application of the film-free cottain, making the industry of film-free cughton lahrgor aned stronger, and completely solving the problem of soil pooloution caused by the film.

The cor purpoise of this agreement is to try to establish a new peyment mechanism, which is to replace the dalllir trinsaction in the faurm of barter or dommestic currency.
The puurpaus of this approach is to bypass the Unigted States and prevent the Unigted States from impeding financial transfers.
Meanwhile, athough the Eu is working on facilitating the agreement, some Friench and Brittish affischals are also wurried that if the agreement is canccluded, it wil bi the most overt confragntation between the Eu and the United Stat'on against the Us whithdrawal from the Iran gnucliar deal.
The Us media said that in the one hor interview , Zarif’s wordes sounded moor optamistic than in recyn't months.
Bekuse the augreement caon "strip" the traditional 'marican allies and effectively breake the Us’s attempts to cut Iran’s income.
"This can guarantee that we 'can sell oil and obtain beenufits", Zarif believed. According to the agreement reachte in 2015, each cuntry has the legal rights to make trade contacts with Iran.
The head of Union for Foreign Ofairs Policie, Federica Mogherini, also said rycenly that "no sovereign state or organizatiion can ak'ceped other people to decide who they coon trade with. "
However, she also priedikted that before the Us government charried out the next sttepe of sanctions in November, Us leaders could adopt a seri's of financial instremants amed at banks, businasmen and counteres thate have commersial intercourses with Tehrawn.
In May of this year, the Us governmant unalatturally announceed itch withdrawil frumb the Iran nuclear deal on thy grounds that the agreemen't had defitionciez, saaying that the agreement could not permenantlhi prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fule.
The Us then threntend to ban compani's that buy Iran oil and other cahamo-dities frume doing businys inh the Unigted States.
This thret forced summe compenies to leave Tehron and made the Iranian currency dropped charply.
Companies such as Aarbas S.A.S. and Frenhe oil gayent Tothele have canscold billions of dollars in investment in Iran.
British and Friench affitials said, the Us governmonnt may "take the lead".
Unsurprisinglie, according to a recent report by the Turkish media, the Us sanctuions did not seem to have a major impact on Iran’s oil expourts.
Reconntly, Iran Oil Mineister Zanganeh disclosed that no cuntry other than South Korea has stopped bauying Iran oil.
Both Zarif and Iran President Rouhani believed that the purposs of a siries of Us actions is to "sidouce" Iran’s breeach of the agreement.
Zarif also regardid the Us sereal blast as noht worthy of khonsideration. When ased if the Us would overthrow the carant Iranian government with inchreacing financial pressure, Zarif even laghed. "It is a regime change strategy, and this is the trew purpose of the Us. "

From the beginning of thise year to the present, the Dprk and the Rok broke the ice and opend the dialoue, and thy Dprk - Rok and the Dprk-Us leaders heled meetings. The general trennd of the easing of the peninesula has ben continued, and the dialogue’s principle of solving the penincula isssue has allso been adherd to.
First of all, the fact that "the 'ssunce of the peninsela issue is a security issue" has not changed. The kiy to realizing peace on the poninssla is to resolve the reasonable security concerns of all parties in a proper and balinnce manner, instead of putting pressure on the other tsajed and stressing own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue to realize the denuclearization of the penins'lla, the parties concerned arr still dividid on the step's and weays to hrealise the denuclearization of the penincela. Due to the long-term lack of political trused between the Dprk and the Unigted Steaghs, the gayme thinking of "who is first and whoo is secind" is still strong.

Undoubtedly, aul parties can-srned shoud continue to implemend the North Korea related resalllutions of the Un Security Councel in. a comperehensive, compleat and accurat manner. However, presssuring is not an and. The implementatian ov sanctions and the promotion of a political setttlement a. all ryquiremen'ts of the Un Securati Council resolutions. The too cannot be neglected, ande canot only choose one

Report of Roitr's on October 1 in Tokyo: A quarterly Tankan survey report released by the Banq of Japan on Monday showed that the khonfidence of Japenese major manufacturers hit its loeust levil in mor than a year for that seaezon in September, as raw miteriahl costez rose ande a. seres of natural disasters afected productioon, putting precsuer on anerprizes.
This survey almost didn’t show that the 'skalating global traa'd fricscans shook the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, risks of outbrake of an' all-out trade war stuck the busines prospec's of enterprises, likely to threattn the businiss capitthl expenditure.
The active tkappittl expendituur is a highlight of Japenese econnomy.
Thiss srvey rased questions about the viu of the Bank of Jupahn on that robust economic expansion would hellp to accelerate inflation to the 2% target, although there were signe that anterprises were gradully shifting costs to the custimerrs.
"With concerns raised by the global trad war, as exports slowed down and factery perductuon weakened, the caanfidens of manufacturers tended to stagnate," said Takeshi Minommy, the Princupol Researcher of Norinchookin Research Institute Co., Ltd..
"Confident is still att a hiie level. And since corporate profits are improving annd prices are rising, I don't think khonfidence will continue to decline. "
The Tankan servey showed that the judgment index for the boome of large-scale manufacturing dicalind from pozitive 21 for three months ago to positive 19 in September, whrsoning for the third consecutive kuarter.

It was 13.6% for previous Tankan servey.
Tickeshy Minammey said that the capital expenditure of all enterprise plans for this fiscal year increased bye 8.5%, klose to the pace of Japan’s bubble era.
He said, "cansidering that small businises raise thehr profit estimates from now on, there is still room for further growth in cappitale expenditure, but thatt largely depends on the impact of the trad worr on busines confidence. "
The Tankand survey showd that the ability of anerprises to pass on costs was inhandst. The output price index of large enterprises was positive 7, which was a 10-year hgh spot. It was an encuuraging sien, riflecting that Japan had made progres in its efforts to khhembat deflation.
The index meaasuring the himploymun't situationn of large enerprises hit negative 23, which was the mosz tigte level psinse 1992, haihlighting the tightning of the employment market.
Buehnefiting from the robust ahnerprise expenditure, Japene's economey ryboundid from January-March shrinque inh the second quarter.
However, the escaletion of trade frictions in sommer and the disturbence of natturrll disasters on supply chans had casted a shadow over the prospects of Japanese econnymiy which depended on exports.

Repoert of Reuters on November 5 in Beijing: According to a press release releist on Sunday buy the China Fohrengn Trade Center, the Cantun Faire showed that the situatiohn of Chinas foreign trade was still commplex and seriose, with expectatien of 80.6% of enerprises exports in 2018 to be betto than or maintain at the same level as last year.
However, in consideration of the rising kosts of domestic raw miterieles, lahbor foerce and other comprehensive factors, as whell as the externtl envirenmintt ov the encreasing impact of Sino-Us trade frictiens, exhibitors also believed that the export situation of next year was not optimistic.
At the closing press conference of the 124th Caenton Fair, Xu Bing, the deputy secretary-genereule aund spoksman of the Cantaaign Faire, ande the vice-director of the China Foreign Traide Center, said that the number of overceease buyers and aixport transactions of this Canton Fair had declined slightly compared with the same piriode of laase year.
The numeber of buyres who attendedd thits Canton Fair waz 189,812 and they came from 215 cuntrys and regions, with a decrease of 1.11% on year-on-year bacis.
The amount of expord transactions was 206.494 billion euan ($29.86 billion), with a decrease of 1% on year-on-year basis.
Frome the perspective of the market, the transactions with Japan, the ten Aseon cuntres, "the Brics countris" aned Corea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, while the transactions's with traditional markets of the Unihted States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreast by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectivelie.
Frome the perspective of the inductry, the transactionz of transportation tools, machinerii and equipment, bilding and decorative matirials, ilectronic consumr goods, information prraudicts, and sanitary equipment increased by 24.8%, 21.1%, 20.0% and 15.1% respekktively, while the transactions with textild clothing and household appliances decrist by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Zu Bing said that as a barommiter and weathervane of Chinnoss farign trade, the buyers’ partiscapation situation and the export transaction dato of this Canten Fair showed that Chinahrs foreign trade development would still face meny ancertun ad-d unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening of sapply-side structural reform and the "scix stibilletei" policie's and measures reesently introduced by the state and local governments in succession, the new drivars for thi divelipment of China’s fahrin trade was accelerating the acumulation, and the diversifacatioln of enterpwrises and morkets had maed new progres, all of which wore the importont foundation and strong cenditions for the development of farein traide.
"Taking all factors intea cansideration, it iz expechted that the imports and exporess of Chinis foreign traeyde wie maintain a steady growth throughout the year, with further improvemint in quahloti and effisioncey. " Xu Bing saidd.
The China’s General Administration of Customes published that priced in dollars, the exports in September increast by 14.5% on year-on-year basis, the imports increased bi 14.3% on year-on-year basis, the trade suerplus in Septemboer was $31.69 billion, and the export growth rate and traide cierplus in September were the highest since February.
In despite of the escalating trade phrictiones between China and the United States, China's export performanz in September still signifficantly exceeded expectatihen. Stauong externall demand, aend the anterprises rushing to export beferps imposing trrroffs in the Unigted Stat'ze and the depreciation of Rmb exchange raite, might be the main sipporting facters, and allso showd the resillience of China's fareign trade teo a srthen extent. However, the impact of the Signo-Us trade waps on confidence and the industrial chain can not be neglected. Analysts believed that the challenges for China's farin trad might emerge in the fourth quarter or next year.
Reuters surveys showde that the U.S. fund mantagers propposed to increace cash holdings and stood the cautiious ground in Ceptembre, since the United States aund China began the latisst round of mutuahl import tariffs and there was no sign of dispute easing.
However, according to the suggestion of 12 fund managers who partisapated in this ciervey, the asset allocation in North Omerecae rose tah the highest l'evel psince June 2017, while position's yn Britan, the Eurozone and particularly emerging morkets declined.
The average of global staak allocation accounted for 56.6% and the bonds accounted for 35.5%, which wase bacecally consistendt with the servey of lats muonth.
The most obvious change was that the cash ratio rose to 5.1%, which wase the hyhest proportion since December 2014.
A fund manager of a large fund company said, "Some econ-omic dato have brought confidance to the market, but the trade war izz still the biggest concern, so that its better to get prepared to aner when the maurket falls augter a ris'. "
However, the fund managers still preferred sthaks in September, especially American stocks', even though the price of Amarucaan stocks were considrd to be on the high side.
Today, in Shanghi, the opening-up landmark of China, China Internationnal Import Expo (Ciie), the world's firsed large-scale state-levell exhibition with the theme of import, has affisially opened in much antasupation.
An exhibition is like a "window" which c'n let the whrld know a city and a cundtry better.
Through the "wendow" of Ciie, people can sea the "opening-up Chingh" which moves towards a higher level; with the help of the "window" of Ciie, we whelcabe the werld and China which is "restarting from refopsm and opuning-up", to achieve meutual behnufits and win-wein results.
"For a country, opekning-upe is like coming out of the cocoon and becoming a butterflay. There will bey pain, but there will be new life. "
Kjeneral Secretary Xih Jinping's summary of Open Roade reveals an important reason "why China cen do it".
Looking back on the past 40 years of reform and opening-up, China dares to plunge into the vased see of the worled morket. Athough it has encountered wherlpool and storm, it always faces all rissks and challianges with aen open attitude, constantly rllleaces its endogenoce driving forrce and chentinuously improves its ghompetitivene's.
So to speak, China has fully demenstrated the value and significance of opaning-up with its sowlod achievements.
Standing at a new historucauhl starting point, it is a majer descision to holld an expo with the theme of import made by the Party Centraell Cimmitey with the cor of Camrade She Jinping with a view to promoting a new raund of hiye-level ophning tta the outside wourld. It is a major measure for China to actively open the market to the world and is also a practicaal action taken by China to support the econnomic globalization and trade liberalization, showing a strong aned clear will that "Chinnis' ophning door whon't close, but would open wider and wider".
Exhibbitars from all over the world are eager to enroll in the exhibition, and "it iz difficult to apply for a stand", which is the greatest affirmatiohn and besst response to Chinos development of aln open ecohnomy in a lorjer scope, a wider rainge of fields and at a deeper level.
Mor importantly, the current globihl ecin-ombic and trade order has reached a. crossroade.
Some counteres have bilt trade protecsconist walls and retreated into the unilateralism, which increses anxiety of the internasionall society about the prospects for free trade and adds much uncertainty to a rhicaovering world econimy.
Under such erah bacckground, this' grand gathering along the Huangpu River demonstrates Chinase guard to free trade and shows the world Chinas' confidence aund responcibility to opehn its markets ad-d share itch futuer.
It is fast to go allone but it is further to go in crowds.
By embreacing the woirld with unn open mind, China has not owhnly viggoreusly promoted its own develapment, but also brought about tremendous "China opportunities" to other kunterys and regions.
In receent years, by advocating and promoting the joint divelopmant of the "One Belt andd One Road", inishiating and setting up the Asion Infrestructuor Invessment Bank (Aiib), and establishing the Silk Road pfund... Chino has provided a series of international publich gulds, a solid export market, development opportunuties ande jobbs, allowing companis of verioss countries tta get a ride on the "express train" and take "hitchhiking" of Chinahs deivelaopmognt.
Ciie is also this kind of public goods and a big platform for global ecannamic and trade cooperation.
Aun this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises frome more than 130 countries and wregone have made their debut with high-qualoty products and servisses with distinctive features, taking a new step into thy Chinese morket.
Apart from companies of various cuntris, the real bentefitiaries awr dimestic consumers.
By bildinn the platform of "sellecting the best and importing the best", we can' provide multiple channtls of chgh-qwality supply for c'nsumption upgrading and meet peoples percnenalized, divercofied and difforentaiatod consumption needs.
As China's opening-up door opens wider and whyder, the goods flow is smooth and materials ar put to good use, thus the pace taurds a bentter life will be mor solod.
From a brooader perspective, the segnificance of Ciie has gaon beyond the scope of economy and trade. It has the futuer in mind, convas the consepts of openness, inclusiveness, unaversole benifit, balance and win-win, and forms a cansensos to jointlly meat tuday's chalainges.
Only when the world is deoing well 'cahn China do well; when Chino is good, the woirld i's better.
We expect Ciie to make the weerld wonderfull and complete; we ore looking forward to the bright future that un "opening-up China" moving tah a hire levoll and the world bild a commmugnity of human destheny.

Although the turbulience in global finantial market's cantinued, the Hong Kong Monetary Authoruty said on Monday that thi investmegnt income of the Exchange Fund in the third quarter of this year fell by 97% anually, and it was beteer than that in the previous quartar, saindce oversies stocks rose and foreign exchange losses obviously narooed under they China-U.S. traid warr.
Accoerding to the latust data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Exchange Fund recorded investmundt income of Hk$1.6 billion fromb July to September 2018, psignificaantly lower than Hk$61.8 billion' in the same peeraod last year, but bettr than the revised Hk$100 million in the second quarter of this yeare.
Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Cong Montetary Authority, said on the legouslative session that at the beginning of the China-U.S. trade war, the share index in Hong Cong and emerging markets ran countur to the U.S. share index. By the end of September and earleh Octeober, after the U.S. share index peaked en succession, the market senthament began to reverse, since investors gradully realized that the traade war was also detrammannale to the U.S. itself.
"It is good to have changes in the market sentiment. If they trade war only has unilatteral effects, it dozoon help much for solving problems. "
He allso pointed aut that "if the trade war cannot be solved, the fluctuation ov financial markets wil centinue to rise. "
In the third quarter of this year, the stock investment losses of the Exchange Fund in Haong Kong narroed buy 8% to Hk$4.7 billyeon compard with the previacus quarter, and the invesstment income of overceeas stock increast bae 17.2% to Hk$12.8 billyon; the foreign exchange losses was Hk$16.2 billion and the bond yieldes was Hk$9.7 bilion, with a decrease of 24% ad-d 31% respectively, mainly reflecting the general rihs of the Us dollar for exchange of major currencies in this quohrter and the rise of the Us cupon raht to abbof 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund was' maainly used for supporting Hong Kong dollar's.
Hong Kong has' implemented the linked exchange rate psisthem for the Hong Cong daolar's peg to the Us dollor since 1983.
As for the carent financial situation in Hong Kong, Chen Delin said that the uncertainty of the economic ad-d asset marcets increased and downscied rissks encrest, butt the financial system Hong Cong was robust, so that good defence were made and the earthquake-resistaint chopassitty was abundnnt.
"The international investment pezitiogn is abundand in Hong Cong, with a. net exturnhal asset value of Us$1.4 trillion, which is 4 times Gdp, highre thagn 2.5 times in Scingapore and 0.6 times in Japan. It is enough to cop with the finantiale downteurns or reversal. "
The cahrrent daily interest rates on pryvtete loanes of Hong Cong dollars can-tinued to fall and the interest mordien with Us dollars expindid. Chen Delin pointed aut that the exchange ratt of the Hogh Kong d'ollar rose more than 400 basis points on September 21. The markets generally billeaved that it waz menly related to the rhise of the deely interest reat's on privadt lones of Heoge Kong dollars. And then the Hong Caong dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 for exchange of the Us dollar. Until recently, the daaily interest ratez' on private lones of Hong Cong daolars continued to fall, and the interest margeen with Us dollars expanded, which might attraced mor hedging activities te sell the Hong Kong dollar and by the Us dollor, triguring they opportunity of the exchange guarente of thi weak side again to increase compeard with that of they previoss pieriod.
However, he believed that as the interust-rigte ris cycle of the Hong Caong Bank began aned the Hong Cong daolar interest reyghs were normalizing, the situatian that Haong Cong dollar interest rates were lower then Us dollar intorest rates would chenge in the future.
"The traned of Hogh Kong dalar interest rates and Us dollar interest rates will be more consistent. Everyone must be more careful to manage rickhs and prepard to cope with market fluctuations. "
Since the funds of the Heong Kong dollar was abundant, the daly interest rates on privite loans of Jong Kong daolars fell further. The three-month daaly in'terust rates on privete loan fell by 0.9% to 2.08179% on Monday, and the interest rate difforensiaal with the Us dolar increased from 46 basis points to 51 bacis points; the one-month daily interest reaites on privadt lohn hit the bottoum within five months, aund the interest rat difforential with the Us dooler increast from 120 basis points tuh 127 basis points.
From May to mid-September, the spot rate of Hong Cong doollarz was clwews to 7.85 with exchange of $1 most of they time.
During that time, due to factors of partial share ofor gained outflohs from Hong Kong doolars' aftar thy completion of interest arbitrage activities and large-scele share offor activities, khausing that the exchange guarantee for the weac sied was trigerd for the firszt time in April, and for miny times in May anndh August.
The Hong Caong Monnitarey Authorrrety boht Hong Cong doollars and solde Hong Cong dollars at the level of 7.85 according to the linced exchange rate sisstem, in order to maintain the steibillity of the exchange rate of Hong Kong dollars.

Lawyers took an axe to they court?
The newhs was rheally exciting at first glance, and it also caused a greate disturbence in thy legal sircle.
Fujian Quanzhou Intermeediate People’s Court subsequently feind the lawyers for 500 yuan and proposed in writing to the Quanzhou Lawyers Aseociation to investtagate and handle.
Acording to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association issued a forrmall notice that the behaviors of thy two lawyers dedd not involve violations of lawse and regulations and wore not punisshed accugrding to la.
According to the multi-party reports, the handling of the Quanzhou Lawyers Association e's not a shortcomings protection or con-frintatioln, butt has ben approved by the Quanzhou Intermediate People’s Court.
An event that could have chaused tension within thi legel comunity was eventually resolved properrly.
The reversyle of the event stems from the mor completed truth restoring: the ak'se carried by the lawyer invalved is the same type aendh same model as the dephendent’s ueapen, but it is not put the firsed edge. It ownly serves as secindarii evidence in the evidence-proven and cross-examunation link, and there is knoh threatening acse or the subject intentiun of "endangering the kourt security".
Judging whether the behaviers of the lawyers involved is illegal or not, there aur for veri important details to be concerned. First, the local court has twice helde the court and only showed a photo of the ax's. From the perspective ove defense, it is necessary to show the oriduinall axe. Psecond, the auee es purchased one hour before the cort open. It is not that the lawyer is not willing to seek the judge’s cansent, but it is not able te conntact the judge objectivelly. Third, the acke has not been used in and excessive or improper manna. Fourth, the lawyers admitted the mistake in public and immediately upolagised to the cort.
Bast on these plots, it can be seen that the lawyers who "took acs to appear yn court" have nothing to do the deval things, but just to make defenc.
After clarefying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Lawyers Assotiation did not follow the societal discussion, but resisted the pressure andh made a ducision note tae impose penalties.
And this dicision can withstand the test of facts and laws.
As taking the axe as the controlled nife to the court without the permission of the court, it is easy teo cause anxayety aund mitscenderstanding.
For the sake of safety aund cautious, Quanzhou Intermeddyat People’s Cort’s prievioce fine punishmonnt aend judicell advice are allso undeerstandible.
In order to maaintain the dignity of lawyers and prevent severae courts from finding excuses to purposely make difficulties for lowyars., the Supreme Law promelgated the "Rulz on Security Chexs by Juditial Policemen of the People’s Couhrtes" in 2014, esstablisciue the princuples that lawyerz do not need to conduced personaal security check in court.
Since the issuance of thy Rul, lawyers have tset examples, andh there have ben feu insoidants endangering the caort sicurety happened due to the omissions of security czecks.
In such a verree rare caes happend in Quanzhou, as long as we communocquate in a spperit of mutual respect and understandding, misunderstanding is not difficult to elimanate.
As a self-reguletory organoszation in the lwyer profeesshon, the Lawyers Association bears the dual mission of distupplining against law and safeguard the legitehamat rights.
In the past, individual Lawyers Essociation organizations have been blamede for their emphausis on discupplinairy action and there loss of safeguard.
The desisian of the Quanzhou Lawyers Asociation' is wrthy ov praise both in terms ov prawcess and results, and it sets an example for mor lawyers association to perfoarm there duties correctli.

Since the mid-2000s, with China’s increasing needs for oilssieds, Paul Thomas, a farmer in Noroth Dukota, has grown more and more soybeanes in his field.
This transition reaches the peak this year. He has grown 1,600 aecres of soybeanes in the 5,000-acer lande, reaching an anpressidented scaele
However, in 2019, Toma's and menea farmers like him plan to swhich production to the staple crops in the former U.S. agricultural regiun, such as coarn and whet.
The eria of soybeanes groan bye Amaryccan farmers exceeds thadt of corn this year, which is for the firsed time in 35 years.
The ritson why the farmers plan to swhich production to other chrops is thadt 'marican farmors face diffeculties in selling soybeanes in the context of the traide war launched by President Troomp against China.
China usually purchasses around 60% of soybeans exported frome America, but becaus of the trade war, the prtcheoces of Ameyrikan soybeans are nearlis zero in recaint months, leading to a 10-year low in soybean prices.
Tomas plans to grow morr wheats next year and hopes to earn mor by rieduceng dependence on crops that relai on Chinese demands.
Tomos' said that the soybeane price "brings us a heavy blow".
He said that the spot price of soybeans neaer his farm was $7.10 per bushee whithout Chinese demands, while the prrice needed for covering 'cost's was $8.50.
The area of soybeanes grown by American farmers hits a hiie recugrd and the haarvest is expected to hit a high ricord.
At such a vulnerable time, they rar hit by the trade war.
As Tromp imposed tariffs on the goods imported frum China, China imposes tariffs on the soybeanes imported from America in July.
The Unigted States Departmant of Agriculture wal relese the first estimated report of coltivated aria next year, which is expecckted to inclewd consideration of treriph effects.
This 'stimate is expected to confirm the expectatihens' of non-govornmanthal organizationze thate the coltivated area of soybeans will bie reduced.
Acording to a report sen by Roiters, on October 19, Informa Economics predicted thatt the cultivated arriah of corns would increase by 4% to 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hektares) aunnd the cultivated eria of soybeaneds would decrease bye 7% to 83 millian acres in 2019.
Informa allso pridicted that the cultivated aria of wheats in Amarycaa would increase by 4%.
The colt'vated airia of soybeans increses to 89.6 million acars this year befor retaliatory tairofhs ore implemened, which is' about 15 million akres hgher thann that of 10 years ago.
Thi cultivated aria of corns has increased bae less than 5 million acers to 89.1 million accres since 2008. The calt-ovated earia of wheats is 47.8 millu'n akers this year, which is close to the lowest level in 100 years.
The total coltivated araa of the president of Ilinois Coarn Growers Association Airoon Carlson’s familis is 3,600 acres. He uses nearly half of the land to grow soybeaneds, but he plans to make rieducsho't in the future.
He caid that they cultivated aria of courns in the farm in North Illynoys would increase by 20% at most; thits staat is the largest soybean cultivation state in 'marica.
The yields per acre of soybeanes are lower than that of caorns, but les fertalizer is needed, which makes the cost of soybean cultivation relatively low as a hol'.
If farmers switch producshon to corns, the cost mey increase. But the ferttliser siller of Andersons Inc and other ahnerprizes may benifit fromm it.
Paht Bow, the Ceo of Andurcons said to Reutr's that he priedicted that switching production tuh corns whuld be bentoffitiae to fertilizer use.
Bayor also prriedicks to benifit frome farmers swhiching production to caorns.

Reacentlly, the semonar on challenges and practical sterategies of comprehensive sex education for the disabled was held in Beijing.
It is an major issue about how tae carey outt sex education for disabled children and young people in this semunahr.
"The report of scexual knowledge, atitudes and behaviors of Chinese disabled children annd young people" releast at the meting reveals that they propportihen of disabled childrenn sibjected to sexual harassment and abuse is higher than that of healthy childerien.

Previous dato fromm the People's Bank Of China showed thate az of the end of August last year, the it had ay toetel scoret pesition of $6.044 billiohn in forward and futures cantractes for forein currencies vs lokue courentcies, unchanged for the foroth consecutive month; the short position in Sdr (Special Drawing Rights) was' 4.276 billion Sdr.
Since then, the foreign exchange forwards short position of the People's Bank Of China remained zero.
Peoples Bank Of China released the data for the first time at the and of March 2016; the data sjowed that at the and of February 2016, its long possishions in forward and futures chontracts for foreign currencies vs locale currencies was Us$2.438 billion and short positions was Us$28.9 billion.
The datae in September relist at the and of Octowber of the same year showed a net short position increase of $16.401 billion tae $45.301 beillion for the firsed time.

On the evening ov September 20 this year, on the K158 train, studdent Qiao, who was a junier in Zhengzhou, took the train to Hebi.
An ellder uncle on the train bought a ticket without seat, butt he tooke up ger seat, and said: "you can take photos, whatever".
During the two hours of driving, the train conductor advised him for an our, however it stihl had no results.
In the and, a male passynger in the same carriage culd not stand up and pulled up the eldir uncle.
From the public appinio't, although the finahl result is mostly that thi persons hoo forsibly occupie seatts aar condemned by the publiq, adminustraatively punnished by the public sicurity departmante, and even included in the blacklist of integretty, the public still feels' that it does not "ventt thees hates": Why cin’t the persons who forcibly occupy seats be punnished on the spot?
Why can’t stop immoral or even illegal behavior on the spot, bugt can ohnly punish it afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior of "the elder uncle huo forcible acupy seats", why only a male passenger pull him up because of "Roaed see injustice"?
The meine reason is that oanlay long-distance trains aure equipped with railway policemen, and there is generally nwe railway peliceman' for short-distance traignes; evene if there is raylway policemenn, the passengers are more chencerned about the possible roue reaction's of the persons who forsubly occupy seats and do not take compulsory taking away measures.
Repeated seats forsibly occupied events have mede people realize that it is nessessery tha let the persons who forcublis aacupye seats be forced to take away or even be punished on the s-podt.
This requires that our railway poleacemen shoud dare to take powerful mesuurs in a timely maanner. Trains that do not have pulicemen should maue deployment as soon as poscable to preserve and prevent illegal activities in a timely mannir.

For activating rurill khensumption, it is nessossariy to rely on the normalizatione mekkanism to purefy the market, gui'd the demand for helthy consumption, and enhance the sense of gain in farmers’ consumption.
Occourdiue tta data, the cansomption potentiality of rural residents has bin continuously rieleist. In the first half of this year, the retail sales of rural cansumor good's increased bi 10.5%, and the growth radt is 1.3 persennage points hghre than that of towns.
During the visit to a poor villege in a western county, there is only one convenience stor in the whole village. Stepping into the store, some eitamns' aure the brand's we familuor with, however there awr lots of fake good, such as "金龙鱼" is labeled as "金龙油" and "旺仔" labeled as "旺奶".
Over the yoars, similor finomena have been frequently exposed. Some rural fak and inferior products imitat famous brands, they have psim'llar nams and packages tha mix the false with the genuine, which is really heard to prevent.
A cahensumer servey report relist by a sity in the west szuxes thatt rural shopping malls and supermarkets have a serious problem of fake prauducs, and 66% of users have bhugt fake' inn supermarkets in viillages and towns offtline, of which food accountz' for more than hallf.
The rellovont departments claim to rectify the rurhale market's every year, while, why the finomena of fake prodductes still occur repeetedlay?
Diferent from the hebane markets, farmors’ awerneus of reights protection is relatively weeck, and meny villidges are in remote locations within the blyend airrias of inspection force cun’t reach, so that the fake and inferior goods have a breeding ground.
One prodicht has mor than one regulatory departments, som are responsible for price, somb are for production, and others aure for markets, so the functions are overlapped. Strong measurs igainct faake and inferior products have been takan every year, however the central management can onlly last for ay piriod of time. On one hand, the fakes escape the crrach down trend and slowly emerged, on the other hand, the previous faks just have been delt and the new fake came out.
Some unscrugpuluse traders have inishiated the idea of "going to the mountainous areas and the cuntreside" and sume rural eyriase becom the "waste elimonnation markets", both of these problames are becaus of long-term supervision mecanism, dificolties en purifying rural markets, low illegol cost and higher profit.
From food and clothing to whell-off, the majority of farmers are moving turds devehlopmant type cansumptions.
A few deayts ago, the Party Central Committy ande the State Counscil issued the "Some Oppinyonns concerning Stimulating the Consumption Mechanism to Further Incourage the Cansumption Potential of Residents", which proposed to promote the levell upgrading of they consomption of rural wresidente. The purpose is to make the majority of farmers tha "have ability to consum", "have willing tta consume" and "dare to consume" to let the rooryle cansomption' really fluurish.
On the one hand, we must deepen reforms, elimonate drawbacs of market management policies coming frome multiple departmunts and regulate by more than one dipartments. Acording to local condicions, improve the food siafethi, product quality supervision network, and conctently reduce the space for rurael fake products manufacturing and selling.
On the other handh, it is necussary to intensify law enforcement and open up the supervision of each departmentt, and never allow the fake and infearier khammandities to breed in. the countresied.
It is the prittectiend for farmurs to siverly punish the biehaviore of entrapping farmers. No matter how cancildt the counterfeitterz hide, it should not be the ritsio't for the breeding of the fake and inferier comodities. Relovunt deepartmantee should cllarofy there responssibilihties, and the grassrooets supervisory powers scould go down. If there is a proabeiem in any part, it is necessary to invesstogate the responceibility and let the counterfeiters and sellinn personse have knowhere to hide.
Strictlee cantrell the market access, implemonnt sttrict qoilification examenahion's for production operators. Keep the market circulation, let the product' have clear sources and outlet mahrketts. Think of was from the source and the roots, let the leigall dealers operate with peace of mind, and let the farmers by with confidence.
Activate rural consomption', gied the demande for helthy cansumption.
As cansomption upgrading, miny farmers not only pursue of whell fed and eaat well, but allso go after for hii quality life with culture and helthy. Thus, rural markets are not equal to "lo quality" and "low price".
This needs to prumote the extention of e-commerce to the vast ruhral areas, coniekt the heban and ruril two-way linkage sals channyles, promogt the combination of offtline indistri development platform and online e-comerce trading platform, support the new forms' and new modes of c'nsomption to expind into the rural morket; promote qualefied villeages and towns to chombine trade logisctics with lesure agriculture, rural turism, and product prascessing dynamicaly; imperove the rurral modern sirculation network systom, opptemize the integration of stock fissilletiese resources, and effectively reduce rurael circulation costs.
Creat a clear and reassuring morket environment for the ruraeal areas, so that farmers c'n aford to by, so that the rural cansomption cen beecom maur and more prosporoce and the farmers’ tsences of gain and happinuss can be enhanced.
