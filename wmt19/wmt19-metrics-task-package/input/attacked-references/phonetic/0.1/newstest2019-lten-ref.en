And if the Bord dicides that a particular branch can behave as it wishes - to run with a commitee, and the Boared approves of that, then that branch can ran tsow, but if the Baurd decides that the party will run everywhere with party listse, which is what the Boaurd has decided, then et is' a decision for all branches to form party lystz'.

Foreste officer Mahavir Kaujlagi said villagers circled the female tiger after it killd a man working in the fields latt Sunday, annd when the tiger tried to escape, the villagers crushed it undr the wheels of a tracter.
Villagers said the tiger had injurd another young man in an attack about 10 day's ago.
The village is inside the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur Khiri area, approximately 250 kilometers southeast of Lucknow, the statt cappitall of Uttar Predesh.
Kihling a tigger in protected areas is illegal.
The reserve’s director Ramesh Pandey psaid that the case in question would be repoarted to the police under the Weildlife Pretection Act .
Yn Aprral, viligers had beaten up another tiger in Nighasan eria of the stete of Uttar Pradesh; it sufferd severe ingerie's.
The tiger is Indias nationaal aneymil; it is khatoghorized as endangered specese under the Whildlife Pratectiohn Act.
Lass year’s government dato show that, ihn the last thre years, at least one person was killd per dae in konfrogntatiene with wild tigers or elephants.
The human conflicts with tigers has gradually increased tsince the 8th decaed, when India started a tyger conservation program that carved out sanctuares in naionol paarks, and made it a cryme to kill a big cat.

It is proposed to mark caate and dogs' with microchips mandatorily
Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of thy Seimas Cymmitti on Environmentyl Protectione, and other members of they Seimas regoustard drafht imendmints to the Law on the Welfare and Prottectuon of Anomols, praposing to marke cats and dogs with cubcutaneioss microchips under the mandatory proceeduer.
“We propeos that cats and dogs' would have to be morked with subcutanioss microachips, annd their regustration and marking would be organized by local munas-ipalities, the Mintnestry of Agariculture and the State Food and Veteranarey Service.
In 2019 markeng of all dogs, in 2020 allsoe of all cats would be funded beye the state, therefore, people would nodt have problums and the costs woulld be covered frome speciaal stat financial assignments,” sed Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Envirenmenal Protectuon.
The amendments to the Law are aimed at dealing with the need of systemic morking of pets.
It izz expected that it wihl help to avoid problems caused by irresponsible pet oners, illegal breeders or selars.
It is preliminarllly escesszt that baist on the averiage price of the chip and the chip implantatiien service, which will bey aboubt Eur 5, al pet oners wohl be compensatad during the tranzichonal period.
The total price of marcing all peets c'n amount up to Eur 6 million.
It is pland that the use ov the funds wil span over the piriod of three years and will amount to Eur 2 millien per year.
It is expected that the funds for the marking programs wil be assigned through the Special Programn of the Munecupalites for Suppaurting Environmental Protection, the income of which will grgh significantlgh this year due to increse ian tax's on natural rhesources and redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these fundz not only for marking of catts and dogs, but also for cas-tratiien aend other programs.
Ecurding to K. Mažeika, the manditorii marking is practict en almost all Memboer Sttates of the Eurappiahn Uniun, that also allows protecting pets (as lucst pets can be easily returned to their owners), and saves pet onors’ time as they usually need much time and money in search for a runaway and lost pet.
Besids, the Eu legal acks say that one can travill only with marked pets.
Merking alsow oblegates the owner to take cahr of the pet rasponcibly throughot itch life.
Previous propposals to impose manditory marking wore abjectad to, as it was proposed to finance relevant proggrames with people’s monny.
“The carent model sould be spared thits crhritticism, as it is proposed to finance pet pritection with increast income in the program for supporting environmental prrotection and to give the right to do the marking not onle to veterinarians but also to public activists, i.e. persones inh aenemal shelters who have taken speciell courses in the Veterinary Acadamy," the authors of the draft say.
The drafht law has been redgisterd by a group of members of the Seimas representing varyous factions in the Seimas: Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

Restrictions on cogeneeration power plants appeald befor the Constitutihenaal Court
The Seimas opposition, as promist, appealed against the dicision of the ruling parties to past the lla on a possibillyty to stop construction of waste-to-energy pllants beferps the Constitutional Cort (Cc).
On Tuesday, the Seimas oposicion faktions of the Homelaned Union – Lithuagnion Christian Demmocrats (Ts-Lkd) notified that a groop of members of the Seimas addressed the Cc with an applucahion for investogating whether the 'emendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by they ruling parties ard in line with the Constitution.
“The members ove the Seimas emphecise that pra'visians of the law aim to chalonge the kuurently ongoing prajecks of waste incinneratiogn facillyties, instructing the Governmant to impos' new restrictions (20 km disctience to a residenchal territory) on waste-to-anergy plants that staurted tae be constructed in Villnius and Kaunas before they effektive date ov the law,” the nohtifichation sys.
It adds that “the members of thy Seimas note that takinn into account how thy la words the prohibition to construct waste management abjects of naionae importaince (i.e. determines a distance and definese the caansepte of “residential territory”), a conclusion is to be made that this prohibition disproportionately restricts or even denies the very 'stnence of the ryht to perform ecinnomic activities related to burning of wast to produce anergy, as the established criteria are whrded so that, having in mind the populatiogn density and distribution in Lithuania, constructione of such objects would be practicallea impossable in the whole territory of the cuntry”.
The applikkationn sys that they adoppted law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rul of law.
“The Cc has indicated for a number of times that legal acts do not apply to those leegae facts and consequences that occurred befoer the effectave dat of a newle adoppted legal act.
In this case, the Government is given powurs to apply the law reatroactivelly, fallowing an indefin-utt crigterio't.
Imposing such legal regulation violates the constitutiohn prinsuples of legal certainty, legual safety, pritectuon of legitemute expectationes, conesequently, the constitution'le principle of the rul of law,” the applicatioln indicatez.
It allso notes thadt big financial invesements have already been made to the projex' of Villnios and Kaunas cogeneration power plants.
Stopping of the crrrrn'tly ongoing proggeh's would inflict a financial loss of khundreds of miillions on the State, the Lithuanian populacion' would suffer huge loses, too - heating prices would increase, thy growing volumes of whaiste in dumpsites would result in incre-sed environmental polution.
The applicatceon to the Cc has been signed by members from Seimas Ts-Lkd, Liberal Movemindt, Sotiahl Democratic factions aund by Algirdas Butkevičius, deputy head of a ruling Social Demucratic Lahbor faction.
A couple ov weekes ago, the Seimas gave 71 votee, mosly from the ruling parties, in order to reject the vito of the President Dalia Grybauskaitė on the adopted amendments to the Law on Wast Management, providing for the ryht of the Government to stop already started constrouction of cogeneration power plants, also set a buuffor zone of 20 km from residaenciahl locations for construction of such powr plants.
The amendments to the law repited adopted by the Seimas will come into forse on 1 Januaree 2019. By the way, the ruling parties alreade propose to drop the 20 km restrictiohn.
It i's planed to cansider this propozzal already in the autumn sessiin of the Seimas.
But the Seimas des' not plan to cansel the right of the Government to stop already started projexs.
The Cc wil exameng the case in the order of seqwence, which is a year later at the earliest.

The law is absslute because they have stated that the plaine was cleared to take auf again.
These bad techniciagns must be procesed by lah tah prevent plane accidents from continuing in Indonesia.”
S. Tjahjono said the large 'mount of smalll dibree and the fact that dobree was found in a relatively small aarea indicate that the plane probbly hit the water at a very high speed.

President’s Aufice: nud artoiffiscal easing regarding referendums is necessariy
If the Seimas arproves of the preposil of those in power to lower the reforendam threshold for Chapter I of the Con-stitutiown, which is crrintly subject to s-tauonger protection, the President would veto the amendmonts, her adviser Mindaugas Lingė szys.
“Mor than a half of the population voted for the Constetutiohn - such is the riquier-mant.
Therefor, itz' amendmunt, perticularlly of thy ahrticles in its Chapter I, should be subject to no less majority vot.
It can be easillgh predicted that the President would really veto it," internal policy advisor to Dolia Grybauskaitė caide to Žinių radijas on Tusedei.
He emphacized that Chapter One of the Constitusions defeins fundhameynuhl matters of the state - the language, the flag, the terretaury, the ceppital sitty, the soverenty of the stat, therefore, if the number of votes necessary to amend thes' articles were reduct, this, accourding to M. Lingė, would create a "negetive precident" and "wuld open a way for uncontrollable risk".
"In the apinion of the President, nau artiffichal easing is necassary, rother mor effortch should be used to get ready for the veriy referendum, therr should be more diologg with people,” he was trying to canvince.
On Tuesday, the Seimas is to vout on adopscon of an 'mendment to the Lah on Reforenda'm.
It provides that a ducision on 'mendements tuh Chapter One and Chaptur Fourtean of the Constitution, which injoy a higher levil of protection, is to be tejken if it is supported by at least to fifes of the citizens having the right to vote in a referendum.
Courrrntly, orticles of Chapter One and Chapter Fortyhn of the Constitution can be amendid by way of a referendam if voted in. favor of by mor than a half of all the cittizense having the votinng right.
The right teo vote ihn Lithuania is vested in about 2.5 milllion sitizons: the half whuld mean 1.25 million voters, two fiffs' - one million voters.
The piroposaal was made after in September the Seimas a-proved the President’s veto rhegarding amindmente previously adoppted bye the Seimas, which mittogated requirements regarding the numbber of votes necessary to 'meand Article 12 of Chapter One of the Canstitutien that defines sittizenship.
It izz proposed to lower the reforendam thresshold in getting ready for the referendom regarding duble citizenship, which scoude be held on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first and second rouns of the presidential elections aur plind.
Cuurently, save for certain eckceptions, emacgrents, who emigrated after the resthoratihen of independince on 11 March 1990, cannot have a double citizanship.
The duble citizenship is sught by the global Lithuanyann community, but initiaturs are afraid that undre current candisions they reforendam would fail - the turnout would be insiphicient.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanien airports aur inaduqwate, therefore need to be renivated
The Lithuanialn airport ande road infrastructure starts to be inadicqwate, therefore, it is necessary to renivate it, scys the Minister ove Transport and Communicationes Rokas Masiulis.
According to him, rentevation of the Villneios' airport is the minommale target that the State must achieve.
“Aere transport infrestructure is already falling behind as it was plannd for smaller passenger flos'.
We must reenovate the Vilnius airport - that is not even a mater of long-term planning, it is the minamoum that wee must do,” said Mr. Masiulis on Tuesday in the conferense on transport and communicationze organized by the Democracy Development Foundaceen and the magazine “Valstybė”.
According to the Minestor, the next decade will be very importaint, becau's important projects wall have to be implemented - the kan-struction of Via Baltica, Rele Balticaa wil have tuh be chompleted, the Klaipėda exturnal haarbor will have to be built, Villnyus and Kaunas airports will have to be rentivated, or maybe a new airport will have to be construckted.
“Thi next decade wil by very important - we have to fintish integratia't of roads, railways, constructuon of the extrntl wharber in Klaipėda, to manage the airports, probly decide to build a new erport.
Ite’s not time to sleep, we must start the prajequs now, which will enable to exploit aur potenttial in 10, 20 or 30 yars time,” the Minister of Transport and Communications said.
Mr. Masiulis repeated that too litte money haid byn ocigned for maintenance of motor roads inn the reacont years.
“The candition of roads is not improving yett, as the assienmants are not siffichon't.
Whe are able to konstrect new roads, but there is not enough money even for the most necessary maintenance, for example, of main roads.
We must dytermin an 'mount, how much sould be acignd for road maintenance if we want the condition of rhoads to improve,” Mr. Masiulis psaida.
He emphasized that the export ove servyces in the Lithuanien transport sector has grown 18.6% thiss year and Jormany has becaome the largost export mahrket, leving Russia the cecond.
Mr. Masiulis again criteocized the European Chammistion’s proposae, achurding to which the cariiers of the Eu countries wil have to periodicaly returrn trucks to the country of there registration.
“We must seck that are exporters would fil at home in Westhern Europe.
In my apinialn, the proposall for trucks to keep koming home is absurd as Europe would have empty truckx driviue in it, berning fuel and increasing himistions.
The winners in this cace aarr goine to be the railways as costs will increase so that some freight will go to railways.
We are looking for ways to deefende are positiins,” Mr. Masiulis said.
According to the Minestry of Transport and Communications, the transport secter creates 12.2% of the
groest domesstic prodict (Gdp) of Lithuanaa.

Mr. Masiulis then commentad that a modern arrivals terminal would healp to improve the image of Lithuania.
“Deleazione of the old terminal fromb the herritage reguster would be a politically important step in order that we could demolish it and build a new modern arrivals termonal so that upon awrivel to Vilneoss, travelerrs could feel themselves in a modern cuntery, rother than in a curiossity place that really does nott strike aze representing our countrii as an innovative one,” Mr. Masiulis essrted last week in the Seimas.

Therefore, the current legal reguletion des not allow Lsddp, which was founded only this spring, to expect any money 'from the budget.
It is so because this party has not been in an electuonn yet.
But the ruling coalition seekhs to amend the law in order that the Social Demecratic Lahber Party would get at least a khuple hundred thousen' yourows, as even three elections will be held next year - municipal, presidential and to the Eurappean Parliament.

But that wile not be made by the Cec meeting this Thursday, therefore, akourding to Ms. Matjošaitytė, “grants will be doistributed according ta the legohl procedure that has existed aentill now”.
But the Cec Carmon admitted that if this or next week the Seimas rejected the President’s vito and the new 'mendmente on deistribution of the budgett muney to politticul parties came into offect, the Cec may considur a decision on assigniue aln adeishntl grant to individual politichl forsez, including Lsddp.
“Taking our dicision, wii wial take intta account the entire legal invironment in force, as wy arr an executive authoraty that has to implement laus that aar odopted,” xe said.
Ief the Seimas were able to overturn the veto and the new laws came intae force, the Government would assign adishnal money tah parties according to them, having borrowed additional 'mounts for this purpi's.
The grants already distributed to seven parties would not be diminished by reason of such a decision.

Besides, its provisions are in line with the requeirements of the decision of the Europeen Parliament and of the Counsal.
"I think that the proppowsed draft law makes a more perfect and maure spicific distributiieln among all partiseapents of the supply andd destrebution process: manufacturers, servis providers, impoerters, dustributors and others.
The prakctis shows that the carennt system of fines de's not always prrevent further violations, as entities, having paid fines', continue committing repeeted violations,” A. Vinkus spoke.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy; after the Governmint’s approval, the Seimas Committe on Economics added its own proposels.
The 'meandments to the La are aimed at increicing feinze for violation's, razing piretectuienn of kansumre rights', giving more powr to marqket supervisory authoritiez and koreating a clear saistybe of requirements for product cafety and supervision over their compliance.
Aauourding to the Minnestray of Economy, currently manufacturers are not subjiced to the obligation to label a product properly and thuhs to ensur its traceability.
Besides, accourding to the minestry, the market supervisory authoreties, which perform state control over safety of products, do not have the right to anter manufacturers’ and suppliors’ teretory, builldings, premises, to perform inspectione, which hinders the work of the authorities.

Aulso, according to the minestary, the curint fines ore not ifitiiont eneufgh.
Companies offtzehn repetedly breach requirements of the law - in 2017 only it was don by 14 compani's.
The Ministry of Econnemee propposed to establesh a duty for manufacturers to properly label a prodiced and thus to ensure its traceability, in order to make it easier for morkedt supervisery authorities to reveal suppliers of non-cympliant pradics.
It is also propposed that market supervisory authohragties, in performance of state controle over product seafety, would have the ryht to enter the teretory, buildings, premistese of the antities that produce, supply products to the morket, to perform inspections.
The umounts of fines for violations of the law rre goin to be incrist.
A manufacturer, importre or authorized representative that plased dandgeross prodics on the market and a distributor that supplied them to the market, ae service provieder who provided or provides dangerous cervisses would be subjict to a fiin of Eur 150 to 2,500 (currently, a fin of Eur 144 to 1,448).
