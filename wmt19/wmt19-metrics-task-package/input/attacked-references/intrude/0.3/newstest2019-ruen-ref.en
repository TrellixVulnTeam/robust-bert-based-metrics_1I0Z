On Se?p?te?mber 3.0, 1;9;28, i.e%., exactly 90 years ago, th*e Bri}ti}sh bacteriologist Alexander Fleming announced an un]pr]e]ce]den]te]d discovery.
The discovery o`f penicil.li.n marked the beginning of the e<ra of m[odern antibiotics, brought F@lem@ing worldwide fame a<nd made hi+m the No=bel laureate.
B+y the w:a:y, the isolation of penicillin from m/old fun@gi was not the first di=scovery of Fl|e|mi|ng.
A fe]w years earlier, when he ha|d a cold, he placed mucus fr+om his own n/ose o<n a Petri dish (t:hi:s is a kind o#f a gla&ss dish in w~hich e_x_peri_m_ents a}re co?nd?uc?te?d with bacteria) and a few days later he discovered that th]e bacteria t:h:at w#as th?e?re had be*e*n destroyed.
Penicillin was also d(is(c(o(ver(ed b'y cha%n%ce in a|lmost the same way.
Fleming '>s name was added to the l]i]st o=f the 100 mo{st prominent personalities i*n hu>m>a>n history.
His d+i+s+cov+er+y, according t%o many s<chol<ars, changed the cou*rs*e of histo)ry.
W-ith t$he h]elp of penicillin, medicine began t"o b*eat the m@o@st long|s|tan|din|g diseases previously con/sid/ered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene ...
When, shortly after recei!v!ing th&e N;ob;el Prize, in 1945, Fleming arrived in the French c+a+pi+t+al, Paris new>spaper>s wrote: “ He did m:or:e t<han doze%ns of division\s t@o defea$t fascism and liberate France '^'.
According t/o experts, Fl&em&ing ’ s discovery o\f the world '+s first ant=i=bio=tic has saved the li'ves o&f mo?re than 20]0 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming died in h.is hom'e i?n London in 1955 fro.m a h}e}ar}t attack.
He was cremated, and a week later h/is ashes were b`ur`ied i[n the famous Lon<do<n C,a,th,ed,ral o"f St. P)aul.
Where, by the wa=y, a talkative Russian-speaking g}ui}de drew th`e attention of m}e and m\y w<ife t`o it.
And a f<ew years l;ater, we h;ad a chance t)o see Alexander Fleming's full s^ize statue i-n the most unexpected place f/or th?is i<n t;h;e capital of Spain.

Trump spok^e of “ being i?n l%ove ” with Ki"m Jong-un
While earlier the?y h?a?d bullied each o/th/er, the leaders o!f the U,S an^d North Korea have practi|call|y fallen in love, joked D;onald Trump.
US Pr>esiden>t Don+al+d T_r_ump reported a we]ll-executed joke about their succ[e[sses in resolving the North Ko(rea crisis.
A:ft:er starting wi/th mutual threats of annihilation, n_ow the leaders of th}e tw<o countries have smoothed out thei^r relations so well th?at th)e)y are virtually i&n lo*v*e w%it%h each other, th%e American President remarked.
Th:e man i$n the White House mentioned that he ha(d taken o>n th(e North Korea pro!b!l!em from the previous administration as the mo:st difficult problem i%n foreign po=l=icy.
Tru-mp note<s t)hat Barack Ob.ama ’ s t@eam had s(o neglected relations w_i_th North Korea t{h{a{t it couldn ’ t e(v(e(n re)ach the country ’ s leader#ship b}y phone — the other side basically didn ’ t pick u:p the receiver.
Then the US and North Korea we=re on th#e ve|r|ge o|f war, but today the North Kore!a!n leader i`s w'ri'ting “ beautiful letters ” to the W=hite House, sai=d Tr[u[m[p.
T@r@um@p a_dm_itted that he ha:d be,e,n “ nasty ” t(o Kim Jong-un, whi+c+h, b\y the way, was mutual.
But n%ow their relations have been smoothed out t}o th&e point that the le.aders “ have f`al`len i[n l>ov>e with each ot;her . ”
Trump meanwhile as\k\ed peop(le not to t%ake h+is words literally and warned t?hat American media will interpret his sta+tements as i|nc|o|m|pet|en|ce.
Trump pointed out tha"t recently P)y)on)gy)a)ng ha@d stopped its nuclear an)d missile tests, an|d is cl*os*i*n*g military bases.
The A}m}eri}can president is sure tha-t all o@f this i&s the a_chi_evement of his administration.
Last Tuesday Donald Tr.ump spoke flatt~e~rin~gl~y o'f Ki`m Jong-un at a m*eeting of th'e UN ’ s General Assembly.
T]ru]m]p thanked the North K<orean leader f<o<r his bravery an&d f$or the steps h|e has taken to de-escalate tensions.
Trump a[l[so noted t~ha~t sa!n!ctions again%s%t North Korea are being kept in place until the mo}m}en}t of f.u.l.l de`nu`cleariz`atio`n of the Kor&ea&n peninsula.

A@t th^e end o]f the negotiations, the two side+s expressed the int;entio;n to move in t&he direction of a pe#acefu#l resolution of the con!f!lic!t, while n~o~t t<aki<n<g on a#ny legal obligations.
Positive results from t>he meet>ing were t%he suspension of n,ucle,a,r and missile tests by North Kore}a, a|s well as the r#et#u#rn to the US of t_he remai#n#s of American so#ldiers from tha,t country.
A[t the same time, n*o other p-r-act-i-cal s?t?eps toward the denuclearization o&f North Korea are being ta:ken.

To do this, she p=roposes a@s th;e Ukr?ai?nian product - `&` a cultu[ra[l wave, a cultural on;sla;ugh;t."
Nitsoi s\hared her thoughts on `%` the feasibility of eradicating t`h`e Russ'i'an lan<guage i"n Ukr'a'ine" with t}he Ukrainian publication "Observer".
I(n h@er words, t?he rig|ht Ukrainian product is ready now - it already exists a~nd will continue to b*e deve*lo*pe*d.
With ti-me, Ukrainians will `]` re}cov}er" from this "M~osc~ow lang=uage ',', she asserted.
Fo-r example, in neighboring Poland, in her words, Russia-n speech was widespread on tel>e>v>ision a<nd r)adio, b(ut i"t was practically absent i|n t/he public arena.
In th.i.s regard, in Nitsoi's opinion, Ukra\i\nians a<re not usin(g aggressive methods i|n this process: actions b)y auth[orit[i[e[s t(o prohibit t/he use of th]e Russian language, in her o'p'inion, m$erel$y "expand the boundari=es for Uk*r*aini*a*n speech at a legal le'vel."
P#re#viou#sly, Nitsoi shared her e\xp\e\r\i\ence supporting a "Ukrainian language regime" a>t a children '!s c"a"mp in t?h?e Carpathians, where s~h~e w=as invited t-o work.
In D_e_cem_b_er 2$016 s:he thre~atened to sue the Watsons bookstore chain, o;n;e o]f whose cashiers s;p;oke to her in Russian.
Nitsoi l"o"s"t he_r temper an~d threw her change at the young wo{man.
She call&ed Ukrainians' use of Russian w>ords "linguistic schizophrenia '-', calling on U<kr<ai<n<ian<s to re`frai`n f.ro.m us)ing Russian l-et-ter-s even w&hen writing last names.
Re~ce~nt~ly Nit@so@i announced that the n*ame "Rus '#' was s.tol.en fro&m Ukrainians, and thus Rus\sia should be referred to a|s Muscovy.
Even the Ukrainian S)ec)urity Service c_ould not evade the writer '?s wrath: having visited there a>n>d o_ver_h_ear_d con]v]e]rsa]t]ion]s among coworkers i&n Russian, she started a scandal an,d absconded, sla`m`ming th?e d(oor.

Among other things, in the course of t|h|e c`r`imin`al intelligence and surveillance op_erat_i_on_s c}on}ducted by employees of t/h/e Ministry o;f Internal A#ff#airs, it w=as estab~l~is~he~d that Radzhab Abdu^l^a^t^ip^ov had lobbied for the appointment o-f Magomed Makhac`he`v to the p^o^sition of head o^f the b\ur\eau, allegedly havin|g received f/or this 70 mln rub.

After disclosure of t#his information a=t t@he meeting of t'he Sovetsky r]egi]onal c+ourt on Friday Radzhab Abdulatipov denied the accusations against h<im.
"O/f course, a@ll, that today is brought o{n m~e i#n the form of a:n accusation, t_o me it is a+ll new, I am co.mpl.et.ely unaware of it, '-' h]e s\aid.

Kosachev: At t_he 73{rd session of the U&N Gen~e~r~al As]sem]bl]y the s{ub{je{ct of Russia i#n a negative light was practically absent
The head o,f the F'e'der'a'ti'o'n Council committee on foreign affairs Konstantin Kos#achev considers tha_t the 73rd s"es"si"on of the UN General Assembly was su:ccessfu:l f:or Russia a+n+d does not ex}clude tha[t it could become a turning poi]nt in the perception of the Russian Federation a<s an in?tegr?a?l participant i'n the solution of g+loba+l wo*rld pr>obl>em>s.
"The uniqueness of t,he c-ur-rent 73rd se[s[s[ion, in my op|ini|on, i>s i(n that t+he rhetori:c, to wh,ic,h w'e had already a`lmost become accustomed in recent years i@n relation to Russia, was now much more s*u*bdued, '-' said the senator i$n a!n interview published on Sunday b.y Rossiiskaya Gazeta.
H}e explained that in previous years th"e Ru?ssian Federation was sometimes "referred to a=s o'ne of the three m]ain threats to h>um>a>n>ity, on par with Ebola fever or climate chang/e or te}rr}oris}m, Russia w<as among these, in a.ny cas&e, in th^e n'a'rr'ati've of a group of western countries, which o]n this a~cco~unt spoke o<ut quit#e unani`m`o`us`ly '%'.
A,t t[he 73rd sessio:n, emphasised Kosachev, "the subject o"f Russia in a negat!iv!e light was practically a)bsent '#'.
"If one carefully analyses the spee`c`h of the president of USA, t}h}e p'resid'en't o"f France, the speech o*f the forei/gn mi%ni%ster of Ge=rmany, I'm no:t now taking Ukr~ain~e, G~e~org~ia, o(r the British, i.n any case, ther-e was certainly no c:hoi:r," the p}oliticia}n pointed ou\t, no+ti+n+g that R-u-ss-ia "is n>o longer a kind o%f wa]ll on which to practise hitt^i^n^g a t#en#n#is ball".
Th!e he+ad of t(he Federation Council committee do{es n|ot exclude that this indicates a kind of tend<e<nc<y which, in his o?pini?o?n, "will d[istingu[is[h the current session [o?f the U>N General Assembly], although t/h/is tendency m?a?y only fully ma{nif{es{t itself i#n a ye,ar, i!n tw[o, three".
"I d&o not exclude that the curre"n"t sess\ion in some sen`s`e may be pivotal," allowed Kosachev, explaining tha#t "there are t~oo many examples of how w]it]h th>e i)nclu)s)ion of Russia it i]s p\ossible to mo,ve forward i[n international affairs '%'.
As an example h&e gave t,h,e si@tua@ti@o@n in Syria, around Ir@an and No;rth Korea.
"A.t the moment, un`f`ortun`at`ely, i't i>s no#t Ukraine, bu-t I do n:o:t doubt that in time the Russian vi_ew on the Ukrainian c}r}is}i}s wi_l_l a}l}s}o be sought," the parliamentarian a}dde}d.
He supposes that this is connected with th~e appearance of a "sensible, reasonable perception of Rus$sia as not just a p~oss~ible but in<tegral partic#ipant i\n th(e solution o*f gl)obal pro`blems o^f our time . '\'
"I hope I am not mist<ake<n, but I have a fee'ling th&at w;e will pas*s t"he point somewhere beyo;nd which movement wi.ll not b*e backwards, it w>i>ll be moveme,nt forwards," he ad#ded.
One ot<her `>` interesting and i+mportant feeling ';' i/n this context Kosachev said was the `~` dema*nd f#or the R]ussi]a]n view of how the modern world should develop".
`#` I was pre`sent at a great many meetings o-f the head o!f the Russian delegation [a?t the General Assembly session] foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, I he@l@d m/y o}wn meetings, an`d with gr'eat p,l,e,asure I saw that while o|ne-tw|o years or f+i+ve years a$go on the w]hole nobody wa%s interested in th{e Russian opi[nion, the Russian view o/f wha|t i_s happening i:n the wo/rld, now the situation i<s different," said th.e chair o[f the Federation Council committee.
In h^is opinion, this i!s du^e t/o how "t*he so-called ne&w li.b.e.ral order, represented by the West, doe{s not have answers t'o the questions o|f how to solve international problems du$e t$o the obv<ious lack of ideas i>n t"he global space, th"e lack of ideas on how to solve th,e problems o:f th^e M$iddle East, problems o-f terrorism, problems of n.on.p.r.oli.f.er.atio.n of nuclear wea*pons, problems of migration '?'.
"And now th'e demand f{or the Russian v&iew is becoming m\ore a@n@d mo%re obvious," Kosachev said with certa~i~nty, str$e$s$sing t=hat in this sense he c"onsid"ers "the current session successful fo~r the wo%rk of th|e Russian delegation, s@ucce@ssf@u@l for Russia '|'.

And during th_e op"e"rati"o"n, t~he doctors saw a tu-m-or behind the cyst", - said Kikabi;dze i_n the progra@m `]` Once Upon a Tim.e".
Th{e tu*m*o*r turned out t:o be malignant.
Then, 37 y,e,ars ago, th(e residents o!f Tbilisi even came t)o his doorstep to say g`oo`dby`e t.o t(he(ir idol.
Bu_t the act,or's wife did not allow the li;ving ac&t&o&r t)o be written of_f, she firmly believed th-at h(e could beat the disease and for ove}r a year d)id not leave h=er beloved hu\sba\nd's bedside.

A meeting of th{e nationwide i#niti#a#tive group for a referendu,m again~st rais=ing the retiremen)t age was held in Mos@cow on Saturday.
Representatives of 13 subgroups took par#t i}n the meeting, putting forward pro'posa'ls for the w`ordi`ng of qu{e{stions (in to!t!a!l, t"he CEC regis"tere"d f.ive questions).
They decid_ed t%o apply to the Central El(ect(ora(l Commission to register a single initiative group an"d ask the publ@ic t-he questi&on: `*` Are y)ou in favo~r o}f the pensio]n a'ge, as established by legislation a's of July 1, 2018, at w>h>i>c>h Russian citizens gain the right to a"n old-age pension, no`t being incr}ea}sed?"
Th+is wo~rdi~ng wa<s registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives di"d not par~ticipat~e in th{e meeting, but it wa%s considered t?he simplest and le!gally most succinct.
Most of the meeting p!arti!cipa!nts w/ere sup'p'o'rte'rs of t*he Fair Russia member Il>ya Svi~ri~do~v (s(ix subgroups) a$nd the Communist Party o)f the Russian Federation (fou*r subgroups).

In the matc-h between Lo,ko,moti,v an<d A,k,hm,at, Turbin's errors rained d,o,wn fast and furious
Former all-union referee Vladimir Levitin commented o-n th?e performance of r,ef,ere,e Ev)g)e)ny Tu(rb(i(n i)n the match of the 9th ro{u{nd of the Russian championship between L'okomo'tiv a)nd Akhmat a<nd assessed the controversial incidents o-f the ga*me.
`#` How wo-u-l-d y{ou assess Evgeny Turbin '&s refereeing in the match between L*okomot*i*v an,d Akhmat?"
"I believe that the r#efe#r#ee conf|irm|ed tha^t he i\s not suitable fo*r r&ef&e&ree&i&n&g matches i=n the Russian Premier League.
I&t surprises m(e that with th|e mess i$n t~h~e fifth round game between Spartak and Din>am>o, ne!i!ther Turbin himself, no%r t)he heads of Dinamo drew any serious conclusions abou$t his lac.k of abilities.
Th{e result had a quick impact o_n th#e nin$th round: errors in his performance a^nd missed calls on b[a[d tackles rai@ne@d d^own fast an"d furious.
For example, in th.e 50t%h m~i~nute, Locomotiv's Eder pushed over Akhmata defender R&od&olfo in hi"s o:wn penalty a`r`e`a.
Just eight m@et@e@rs f)ro)m t&he g*oa*l l?i?n?e, but Turbin did no<t call a penalty".
"H\ow would you assess the incident with the parti.c.ip.ation of I\dowu, wh|o i'n the 8!2nd minute a|pp|e|ared to handle the b+all?"
`/` I bel|iev|e the defender d!eliberately handled the ball i[n h!i!s own penalty area.
T#urb#in w&as close to the inc/id/ent, had a good v?iew o_f it, a~nd his as|si|s|t|ant was to the right.
This incide(n(t should h!av!e been seen by the fourth official S@ergey Karase"v.
However, no]ne of t|h|e th~ree r.efe.rees did no=t see it, and no penalty was a-ward-ed.
T_he_r_efore, the score w.a.s corrupted, and any s&por&ting j\us\t\i\ce was rippe<d up.
It was a case i`n which refer#eeing by t^he rules wa)s ousted a-nd the sporting spirit o{f the game buried '['.
`=` In th#e 52nd minute, Tur+bi+n d>i>d not dar=e to send off defender Oleg Ivanov, who c*om*m*it*ed a foul i*n a duel with Krychowiak, and when t\he r!ef!eree sho-wed him a yellow card, h+e defiantly ap_pl_auded hi}m.
What d}o you th^ink of thi]s incident?
W*as it necessary t@o brand~i~sh the second yellow c~a~r~d?"
"In this incident Tu+r+bin b`randish`ed th'e fir_s_t y[e[llow card in somewhat spurious circumstances.
A second wo-ul-d hav|e been logic '~'.
`{` Oleg Ivanov tal'k'e'd after the mat/ch about refereeing d+oubl+e standards in th_at some teams a%re aw`a`rded a penalty for such vio;l;atio;ns, a-s i{n the incident with Idowu, and others are n{o{t.
H[ow would y/ou assess t\he player's words?"
"It depends o~n how y>o>u in\terp\r\et double standards.
I\t was a pe\n\a\lty.
B"ut it wasn't g)iven.
S)o the referee d{i{d not give a second pe;nal;ty in t)he op)p)o)s)itio)n goal.
That was t{he pr\inci\p\le a*pplied here.
A.nd t+h+e second incident wi{th double standards is that th`e referee looks a]t who is p?laying.
On Saturday Locomotiv an,d A\khm\at p{layed, and there have been ser-io-us c`omp`laints about Turbin '{s performance, becau:se the team w%a%s put a=t a disadvantage".

The Unite)d States h)as c'on'temp'late'd a naval blockade of Russian deliveries of oi%l a|nd gas
T>he United S,ta,tes could begin a naval blockade o<f Russia in ord<er t#o obtain a>n advantage on the global energy m`ar`ket.
The US government is so eager t}o fight for success on t-he global hydrocarbon market t-h-at it i/s prepared to r'e'sort to a n"av"al blockade of Ru@ssia, whi]ch r`ema`i`n`s on]e of the wo\rld ’ s main suppliers o%f fu"els.
US Department of the Interior he!ad Ryan Zinke sp#o#ke y%est%e%r%day of t)h)e possibility of a na_val bloc*kade.
Unlike other sim_ila_rly name%d government agencies ar+ou+nd the world, th]e department conducts not police functions, b-u-t c$iv$ili$a$n ones, and this includes carr:yi:ng out policy i?n t\he ar+ea o>f natural resources.
For th~i~s r<ea<son, Zinke ’ s annou/n/cement falls entirely within his sphere o,f re+s+po+nsi+b+i+l+it+y, though no]t wit-h-out political overtones.
Appearing a`t an industrial even.t in Pittsburg, Zinke st\a\te\d that wi\th it-s naval forces the US controls shipp_ing lanes in the Mi>ddle Eas_t a"nd could block them if the need a*r*ose.
Zin-ke ’ s words could lead to the co~ncl~us~ion that the need m=a=y b$e tied to W}a}s}h}in}gto}n ’ s desi\re to interfere wi(th Rus`s`ian deliveries on the g&lobal e^n^ergy market.
Zi&nke mentioned t{h{a{t Russ-ia s+till received th"e lion ’ s sha$re o~f its income from world oil and gas deliveries.
He said he is sur=e th`at a desire to d/i/s/tr/ibute e!ner!gy ship!me!nts in t$h$e Middle East as well a?s E%a%st%ern Eur>o>pe wa#s the prime motive for Moscow ’ s expansion in this re=gion.
T'he agency head made it clear that th"e US i#s still considering ma)i)ntai)ni)ng its le`a`ders`h`ip o<n the global energy m.a.rket, now th:at it has b<e<com<e the la^r^gest supplier of oil an\d gas.
Fo_r this, Washington wil^l have to pu?t confine R.ussi.a and Iran, and Zi(n(k(e considers a naval b=loc=kad=e o"f com'm'er'ci'a'l routes to be an acceptable m'eans to th?i?s end.

Ex"pe"nsiv"e violin passed onto a pa$wnsho$p fo_r pittance
When a man brought a violin t$o a LBC Boutique a:nd Loan pawnshop located in t}h}e ci(ty of Somerville, Massach|uset|t|s, the pawnshop w!ork!er offered only US:D 50 fo'r the o"l"d an'd flimsy-looking i:nst:rumen:t.
But a:n experienced stor^e manager, Dylan Mc'De'rmmitt, s:us:pe:cted that i)t was in fact an old and expen+siv+e ins_t_r_u_ment, and he dec{ided to consult with an ex#pert fo*r an appraisal.
It was then discovered tha?t the viol*in was made i;n 1759 by the famous It^al^ia^n vi~o~li~n m<aker Ferdinando Gagliano a<nd is est'im'ated t-o be worth USD 250,000.
The bows alon(e for such v$io$lins ar"e valued at U}SD 16,000–18,000.
A:n investigation revealed tha't the vi#ol#in had recently b*ee*n stolen f_rom one of the residents of the city, and t%he instrument wa~s then return$ed to i-ts rightful owner.
It i;s n^o^t ye}t known how the person who s|old th)e violi%n to the pawnshop obtained the instrument, but i(t is known that th'e seller had no c,r,imi,n,al bac;kground.
The manager sa<ys that n/ow everyone who brings a violin t\o the pawnshop will b(e asked t!o play it to mak/e sure t^hat i*t really belongs t:o them.

The comedy Nig}ht S#chool, w}hich debuted last Friday at American movie thea[ters, ea;r;n;ed $28 milli?o?n on its firs-t wee)k)end in distribution.
Th-i-s s,ucce,ss allowed the unimaginative flick starring K]evin Har.t and Tiffany Haddish t}o top th[e US box office for 28;-;30 September.
Rele}ased so far i=n o.nly 2-0 countries, t.he film bro{ugh{t in $5.5 million, including $2 million f;rom British vie;w;er;s.
In its fig?h?t fo{r firs"t place, what ’ s remarkable is that this cr#ea#tion of Ma@lc@ol@m L+ee pretty clearly g]ot ahea.d of another newcomer in w$este$rn dis,tri,bution, the cartoon Smallfoot, a curious st$o$r$y of a c=h=arming yeti meeting a representative o%f humankind, wh^o^s^e ex)is)t)en)c)e the starring charac{ter had n%ever believed in.
T(h(is project o;f directors K+ar+e+y Kirkpatrick and Ja>so>n Reisig collected $23 million on its kickoff weekend, basically just~i~fyi~ng the exp?e?ctat?ions of experts wh&o had predicted $20?-25 million fo&r t}he we$ekend.
Re/g/a/r/d/ing S?mal?l?foot ’ s total bo;x-off;ice receipts, at the moment th/e/y amount to $38.:6 million (while i*t has debuted already i@n 50 countries): Its m;ost active ma~r~ket was Mexico, fill!in!g the coffers wit!h $3,.6 mi}llion.
The top three a+t the time was completed w)it)h th$e children ’ s tale “ The House with a Clock i{n Its W-a-lls, ” from horror master E!li Roth . This proves conclusively t!hat the director ca)n pro\d\uce quali|ty mo%vies fo_r t>h>e 12+ audien~ce t!oo.
Fo$r i(ts seco*n*d w*e*ek in di`stri`but`io`n, t;he screen adaptation of John Bellairs ’ book with the charming J+a+ck Bl/ac/k and C|at|e Blanchett earned $12.5 mill+ion, br>ingin>g total global receipts t_o $53.8 million.
In spite of its departure from t\h\e top 3, the thriller A Simple Favor, with Blake Lively a;n;d Anna Kendrick, continues t/o be an incredible surprise: The mov.ie was no*t rea^li^st^i^ca^l^ly expec)t)e)d to perform w<ell financially, but du&ring 1$7 days i,n distri`b`u`tion i[n A)m)e)r)i)ca this m)o)vie by Paul Feig collected $43 million (i_n_cl_u_ding $6{.{6 m;illion for 28+-30 O<c<t<obe<r). And right now i^t actually h@a@s $62.+9 m^i^l^lion in t(otal sales.
The las#t of the top fiv?e this we&ek was the h:or:r:or show The Nun, which raked i?n $5._4 mil*lio*n in the reporting p)eriod.
During 24 days i%n A_mer_i_c_an (and of c!o!u!rse other) t+heat+ers, th`e spin-off fil;m The C@on@ju@rin@g has total ea<rnings of $3#30 million and n*ow proudly bears th.e tit:l:e of most successful franchise movie . The franc,hi,se also inclu|des the two parts of T)h)e Conjuring and t?h?e tw^o films about the terrifying doll An:na:b:e:ll:e.
T\h\e results of the past weekend s\h\ow that r[igh[t after t=his Cori-n Hardy horror movie comes o"ne more from tha$t genre, the n^ewly-a^ppear^ed Hell Fest, which is one of the maj*or you>th horrors o;f th)e year.
O&n i{ts first weeken{d the movie earned $5.1 million in the US . It i,s t_he brainchild o$f the f.a.mous f|ilm editor a^n^d now dire:ct:or Gregory Plotkin, who ha"s previously wor:ked o\n a set o_f big horro.r projects including Happy Death Day, which Hell Fest in so'me p>a>rts strongly resembles.
The r;esul;t is extrem-e-ly posi:tive when comp}ared to the film ’ s modest b{u{dget.
Th{e seventh was Crazy R}i}ch Asians ($4.1!5 m;i;ll;io;n), which seems unlikely to fall o"ut o|f the American b!ox of`fi`ce t<o<p 10 . T$he romantic comedy h@as now been on sc%r%een for seven wee-ks, a-nd for Se~pt~e~mb~er it ’ s th'e sixth-highest-grossing film o.f the g.e.nr.e in history, with $165.7 million.
That ’ s exactly t]h]e amount the movie ha]s earned so fa'r o(n the domestic market; its t+ota+l rev%en%ue i+s n=ow $218.8 million.
The last three of th/e US to|p ten by revenue f{or 28-30 Sep#t#e#m#b#er were The Predator, W'h'ite Boy Ri,ck, and Pepper\m\int — las>t weekend they earned $3.7 mil`lion, $2.3"8 million, an$d $1?.1 mil.l.ion, respectively.
W"e ’ ll add that n+ext w>ee>kend in th.e US, the long-awaited Venom with Tom Ha,rdy w!ill b=e i#n full swing . It wil.l without a doubt tak'e over the leading position i_n the American b/ox o|ff|i|ce on the first weekends o*f October.

Actually o=u=r leaders lo/s/t the matchup 0:3, so it was difficult for u~s t/o g]et back into thi+s ma}tch, although we ha^d opportunities.

`%` This is ugly nepotism ')'
The audience i-s outraged by the choice o;f A(gutin o}n th}e show "Voice"
The viewers of the s%how "Voice 60+ '_' accuse the mentor Le,o,n,id Ag*ut*i*n of `@` ugl`y nepotism and brazen sh}am".
When in blind auditions he recognized t`he voice o^f his father N-ik-ola-y Agutin fr@om the f_ir_st notes, m:any ho.pe.d th:at he would remain n<eut<ral an-d not turn to the performer.
But filial f'ee'li'n'gs too|k ov+er, and he picked a r.elati.ve for his te$a$m.
T&hen man+y considered it a j"o"k"e, but forgave t"he mentor bias a/t the fir@st stage.
B-ut th"e `]` joke" dragged on, and t)he star's father absolutely unjust-if-ia-b-ly took the p<lace of more w%orthy performers.
And now the v\i\ewers are not re]ady to f>orgi>ve Agutin fo^r su&c&h an injustice.
Yes]te]r]day we, the viewers o@f t!h!e show, wer<e outraged by nepotism by t`he u{gly a(nd f,ra,n,k dragging our close relatives ont;o the final ladder.
I even doubt_ed that Agutin had the stamina and sense o-f c@o@nsci@enc@e to not drag his dad t]o the end all the w:a:y to first pl/ace", - discussed I+rina Pe.tr.ovs.ka.ya and K's'en'i'a Lar*in*a i-n t+h+e program "P:erson f`rom the TV".
Meanwhile, for t'he s}ake of h{i{s father, Leonid Agutin `?` ejected" wonderful performers who actually s#ang, whil)e Nikolai Petrovich whis^p^ere^d a tou<chi<ng so.ng a{bout his mother, ex(plaining that the viewers still want to s>ee his fa^ther in the sh{ow.
But, as it turned out, this i@s n&o&t at a/ll the case; th'e v#iewers want an ob\jective as=sess=me=nt a~nd to see genuinely talented performers i^n the final, and now Agu,t,in ha;s discredited th(e show.
"I sym|pa|t|hize w"i"th t{h{e participants o?f "Voice" f,ro,m the Agutin team - t%h%e%y were doomed".
"L|as|t t]im]e, Agu]tin s!howed how he l{o{ves hi"s dad, but today he had t:o prove himself as a professional '['.
`{` The competition has lo"st i*ts meaning".
"Remove two talented people f~ro~m the project and lea]ve your fathe*r i@n the pro@ject wh$o d.oes not s.i.ng b;ut whispers, how do y\ou call a mentor after this? ",
"You like how your dad sings, then organize a concert i{n th%e Kremlin w,ith you@r m"on"ey and s>ee how ma`ny p~eople come to th{is concert".
T{his is the s<h<o<w `_` Voice", and no"t the show "Bi!g Shot Relatives '*'.
"O|n the part o`f A~gu~tin, this w;a;s unprofessional".
`{` Then you have t,o offer d;ad to perform on yo@ur o;wn show, and not o:n a show that is ma#de w!i!t!h the money of Channel 1 ','.
"This wa;s a r`e`al chance for s,o,meo,n,e, and he took someone ')s p)l)ace.
And I don ’ t understand w&hy the voicele"ss dad sho(ul(d evoke a greater appreciation than an}y o]ther p.a.rt.ici.pant with re$a$l vocal s^k^il^l^s.
Why was t.he worker from S/ur/gu/t w[ith a magnificent voice and timbre eje^c^te^d, and Agutin's father broug^h^t to t"h"e f%inals?
And then we all compla)i)n tha't f%or dec<ad<es there are the s_ame faces on the stage a&nd on the screen;s!
Yes, be`c`aus`e you cannot b"r"eak th)rough ne&poti&sm!"

T\h\e users a-lso recalled that i)n on^e of t[he seasons of th`e t}radi}ti}o}na}l "Voice", the son of Gradsky took part in b}lin}d auditi$on$s.
Then in no wa[y did it occur to the mentor to take h,is s]o]n in.to h\is own t?eam.
Mo,reove,r, he s|a|i|d: "Come on, g.e.t out of here, everything i%s cl>e>a>r '|'.

Ac!c!o!rdin!g t&o him, the scientific comm~uni~ty is n,ow developing directions f[or such activities.
"T&here is no c!o!nso!li!d!a!t!ed o[p[inion yet '+', - the sc$ien$t$ist emphasized.
He noted t#hat one of the options is t;o place a low-frequency r?a?d?io telescope o(n the far side o*f the Moo$n, whi)ch would h_elp to avoid inte`r`fer`e`nc`e that originates from th+e Ea"rth.
"This i~s the only place where s#u#ch a telescope can b?e deployed t-o rese^arc^h cosmic sources o\f radio w%a%v%e%s", - Petrukovich a@dded.
He also believes that the Moo^n c?ou?ld be used f|or testi(ng ro"b"otics, to use l\oca\l resources for construction.
In addition, c\o\smonauts sho'ul'd be engaged i-n t|he se|a|r|ch f\or primitive organic matte#r on the Earth ’ s satellite, the scientist be+li+ev+e+s.

Offended customer dumps basket with f]ece]s at the 7-E)l)even st-or-e
D[amia[n Simms, a 41-year-old resident o{f St. P>etersbur>g, Florida, harbored a g'ru'dge against th)e manager of a 7-El"e"ve"n 24-hour c_onvenience store: in M@a@y Simms was e<j<ect<e<d from t]he store by the man[ager for inappropriate be-havior.
S]o Si:m:m:s decided to get back at his enem'y in a)n or{i{g{i{nal way.
A@t half p'ast o<ne in the morning, he entered the store an#d du!mped t{he contents o%f the basket t/hat he brought with him partly on the floor as wel)l a]s partly on the products o!n the s]hel]ves.
T)h)e basket contained feces and uri"n"e, which Si]m]ms "bo~rro~wed" f{rom a nearby porta t!oi!let.
Police wh\o arrived a&t t=he scene o~f th=e incident arrested the "avenger."
He was boo!ked into jail a<n<d was r!e!leased b*y posting bail of USD 3>00 pending t|r|i|al.

Although Simms's crime seems more ridiculous than se,r,ious, h$is court sentence could be quite harsh, since he i|s a repea|t offender: he ha's b;e;e;n ch,arg,ed w|it|h gr)and larcen+y, robbery, illegal p?ossess?i?on o?f a weapon, dru,n,k driv!ing, an!d animal abuse.

The SBU e_stabl_i_shed the ide>nt>it>y and d}et}a}i}ned the owner o^f a Peugeot-301, who yesterday wa}s driving around t~h~e c[apit[al with the lice!n!s!e plates of the so-called `(` D%PR".
It turned out to be a for,mer employee of the MFA of Ukra$ine, who currently works a&s an ag&ent fo@r one o}f t#h#e i\nsuran\c\e companies in Uk\r\ai\n\e.
A"cco"r"ding to the pr|ess c%ente%r of the SBU, the d@etai@n@e@e explain$ed that the car had been w~ant~ed by Int:erpol si-n-ce 2014, and was t'herefo'r'e detained i?n R#ussia and transferred to him a.s the representative o:f an insurance company.
When crossing th*e Ukrainia;n-Ru;s;sian border, h$e removed the fake number plates, but a&t th&e ent{r{ance t+o Kiev he in's'tal'led them again.

Macedonia: the referendum failed due t;o t^he low tu\r\nout
The referendum was intended to endorse t;he agreement of t.he aut.ho.rit.i.es in Athens a>n>d Skopje to re`name th(e Balkan c)ountry to "Northern Macedonia '#'.
Greece objected to the u>s>e by the Mac(ed(oni(ans o=f the name of its h[i[storic[al prov,ince.
T;he renaming offered p/r/os/pe/c/ts for the for-me-r Yugoslav Republic t<o open a way to NATO a~nd la?t?er the EU.
But, as t'he EFE age'n'cy reports, the j=us=t 34% t)urnou)t at t.he S`un`d`ay plebiscite `_` d[id not re<a<ch" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since th^e referendum was o\nly advisory in nature, the a*ut*h*or*it*ies i\n Skopje m.ay decide not to reject t/he r~en~amin~g.
S:pea:king soon after t$he closure o*f the polling stations, the prime minister of Macedonia Zoran Z)ae)v, a supporter o}f c,ha,nging the name of t<h<e republi;c, said that if am'o'n'g the v@otes ca=s=t there are m}ore "yes '-' vo_tes, t*hen Macedonia wil@l change it(s name, despite the quorum not reached.

Res;ident;s of Kemerov<o outraged by flock of she:ep in cemetery
O'n Septe=m=ber 3,0, a me]ss]a]ge was posted on a frequente?d soc<ial network page devoted t[o Kemerovo by an eyewitness stating that livestock fr`ee`ly r@o@am one of t,he local cemeteries.
A fairly large siz.ed her.d of animals has been browsing between the fenc}es and a$r$e ea:ti:ng t$he grass.
Commentators expressed var^ious opin$ions: some l!ocal residents n/o/ted that a few livestock i{n the small cemetery causes no h{arm t}o an;yone, and their appetite could e>ven help clear the are_a o;f weeds a-n-d mo`w the grass . Nevertheless, some r/esid/ent/s of the city a=r=e n,ot enamored of the animals.
O:ne outraged r\e\sident o\f Kemerovo po"ste"d (style preserved): `^` Th?i?s i@s a burial place, not a pasture.
Sheep ha}ve n~o business be;ing there.
Of course, you c`an't say t&ha&t the sheep a,re commiting a+n act o{f blasphemy, but th~at's not the p$oint . '('
In any event, one o~f the e,yew,it,nes,se,s noted that the pr{oble{m of the p!re!se!n!ce o<f the a:nimals in the middle of the cemetery is alre<ad<y kno@w@n, an[d the n`ece`ssary measures will b!e t-ak-en soon.
'/Dav/let ’ (to exert p!re!ssure) or 'dovlet' (to l|oom o`ver) - which i`s cor`rect?
Th/e word 'da~vlet' doe\s not exist.
'Dovle=t' is cor]re]ct.
The word `|` dav"let" with t>he meaning of `!` d)ra)w towards, e)x)ert influence, a?n impact '>' exists only phonetically, be,cause we hear the s%ound [a] instead of [o] in t(he wor>d "do<vl<et".
We us%e this word b#e#li#ev#ing that it co|me|s from t/h/e wo}r}d f=o=r pressure ('davlenie').
But "pressure" and "l{o{om o|ver" a\r\e ety%m%o%logi%cally not only not c%l%ose a$nd are even i'n some sense o[p[po[sed in meaning.
H(ave a think ab;ou;t t_ha_t for yourself.
'"Do"vlet' (to loom over) (liturgical, liter/ary, obsolete) m.e.a.ns "quite, complete, en]o]ug]h, t;o b!e suff[i[cien[t for s,omeon,e o$r something, t'o satisfy '\'.
It i~s related to the w!ord!s 'do&vo&lst&v&ovat&s&ya' (t-o be c[o[nten[t) and ']udovo]lstvie' (pleasure).
Previ?ous?ly, i[t also had t;he me;anin;g of `/` not to depend o(n anything, to be self-contained" - `"` t-o prevail ov;er oneself".
Th"e Ol-d Sl"avoni"c "довьлѣти" ('dovleti') is akin to t;he words "command '}' an:d "will '/'.
"Davit '{' (t[o crus"h), "podavlyat"' (t<o suppress) are completely differ`e`n`t.

Russia protected itself from terrorists with its o(pe(ratio(n i`n S{y{r{ia
After three y]ears of Russian mi@lita@ry op!era!t!ions in Syria, approximately 100,000 te-rr-orists ha[ve be]e]n ki]lle]d, of which 85,000 were killed by t(he R/u/s/sian Aerospace Forces.
This was discus-s-ed in connection wi{th the third a!nnive!rsary of the start of the Russian military operation i=n Sy*ria b:y the former commander i~n chief of the Aer]ospa]ce F}o}r}ces, t]he head o-f the Federation C.o.un.c.il Committee o$n Defence and Security Viktor Bon?d?are?v.
He n[ot[ed the h`igh accuracy of air:b:or:ne weaponry: Aerospace Forces hav/e precisely struck a}nd continue to prec`ise`l`y strike a,ll their terrorist t"a"rge"t"s.
I|n Bondarev '=s wo>rds, after t#h#ree years in S)y)ri)a ten]s of thousands of terror=ist targets hav_e be|en destroyed - including, for e#xa#mple, ammunition stockpiles, fortifications, and headquarters.
R%u%s%sian a'irs'tr'ikes broke the jihadist[s' defences - t\hi\s was a decisive in~vestme~nt i"n the advance of Syrian government forces, r'eports Inte;rfax.
In this regard, i.n the words of Bo|n|dare|v, the operation of o`ur f-orces in Syria allowe*d the protection o-f Russ|i|a i>tself fro+m terrorists, many of whom had Russia<n passports.
At the start of the operation in Syria over t&wo thir@ds o@f t_h_e territory of the Arab R<e<pu<b<lic wa~s under the control of te$rrorist groups, including the "`I|sl|a|m|i|c St]at]e" (I|S, prohibited in Russia) a~n~d `=` Jabhat al-Nusra" (prohi(b(i(ted in Russ,i,a).
According to th*e d|ata of the Ge^nera^l Staff of the Ru\s\sian Armed Fo&rces, four thousand IS fighters are Russian c;itizen;s and around five thousand ar}e citiz(en(s o#f pos!t-!Sovi!e!t countries, re(p(orts TASS.
This figure r%efer%s only to those pe>op>le who h/a/ve bee!n id!e!ntified, and does n@o@t taken int~o account those w[h[o were no<t identified, Bondarev emphasized.
The ma$jor$i$t$y of the!m wer}e trained and prep?a?r?ed to take up ar<ms at an@y moment, and Russian passports g(av(e them the r]ight t;o freely enter t=he territory of our country.
Thus, remarked Bondarev, in Syria Rus%sia f'ights international terrorism a"broad - ot<h<erwise this evi+l would `,` spill ove-r onto u,s."

The Met*ropol*i*ta*n urged hi)s followers n_o_t to b"e taken in by those who mislead beli!e!vers.

T:he p~ri~est emphasized, "Bel~ievers have alr[ead[y understood and decided which church t?h?ey w^il^l attend.
Ho\we\ver, someone wa%nts to sow h[ost[il[it[y and dis~cord once again.

An agree!m!e!nt t:o rename the former Y*u*gosla*v Republic of Macedonia as the Rep:ubli:c of Northern Macedonia was reached o*n June 17 as a re_su_lt of lo*ng*-ter*m negotiations w=ith n(eighbo(rin(g Greece, which refused to recognize the rig-ht of its norther/n neighbor t-o b)e called Macedonia, perceiving t`h`at such a na*m*e challenged the same Greek p{rov{ince an~d Gree%k history.
