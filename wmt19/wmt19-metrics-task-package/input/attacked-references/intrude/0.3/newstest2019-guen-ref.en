Thousands of farme+r+s have gone t|o the Hi*g*h Court to protest against t:he dream project bullet train o=f G@u@jar@at.
T"he Central Government h~a~s filed a petition for acquiring the la;nd f~rom the Gujarat farmers for th;e dream project of the Bul;let Train i<n the H_igh Co/urt.
A)t t:he hearing, 1,00'0 f?a?rmers spoke of the affidavit submitted advising that the State Government d>id not ha}v}e the right t}o acqui*r*e their land.
The bench of the C%h%i%e%f Ju`stice ha?d issued an ultimatum t-o t`h`e Central Government saying th@a@t if th:e:y did n*ot provi>de a reply on land acquisition by 26t%h, th_e court would release the f|i|na|l order.

The C=en=t=ral Go$vernment is attempting no,t t{o re!spon!d and thus not allowing the Hi!gh Court to proceed with the ca`se.
T$he collectors a=re threatening farmers as a last resort because the S|t|at|e Government does not ha,ve a;n;y strong d%ef%ense against l>and acquisition.
T|hey are bei>n>g blackmailed to se>i>ze the land as per th&e new c(o(nd(itions.
They a!re being thr)ea)tened that if t[he la~nd i`s not acquire*d, it will be seized.
Th#e Central Govern<me<n<t has n!o!t presented an an.s.we.r t}o the High C/o/urt, despite the Sup=reme Court's order dated 10th August.
As a r[esul[t, t~he farmers will again g<o t>o the Supreme Court tomorrow t.o demand th}e cou&rt o?rd?er to be complied with.

There is a pro$vision to cancel the contract if the agreement made b~y th"e Central Gov+e+rn+ment with JICA is u/nfai/r t;o th+e f}arm}ers.
The farmers will i^n^for^m JIC_A about this case . Pur`s`uant t?o a con"tr"ac"t for the bullet train with Japan's JIC(A company, thousands of crores o]f loans have been taken f\or th$e bulle)t trai#n.

China is tryi)ng to make th/e Yuan an international cu_r_rency, si:mil:ar t'o the Dollar, E%uro, Y%en and Pound.
India and Russia are looking a!t t*he possibility of m^ak^ing t@his de}al in R%u%p%ees and Ru#b#le, considering the prospect of a ban f}r}o}m th.e United States.
International Desk: A#mi#d the t{h{reats of US sa|nct|ions, India and Russia have mad.e an agreeme\nt on the S\-40\0 De*f*e*nse Missile Sy!stem today.
R\uss\ia's President Vladi@mi@r Putin will be signing this agreement w]it]h Prime Mini(ste(r N{a{ren{dra Modi on th/e second day o:f his two-day I<n<d<i<a visit.
In order to all:ow t~he S-400 deal, bo+th t&he na$t$i$o$ns are taking necessary steps to find a solution regarding the US Dol{lar a?s t<his transaction ’ s m$ode o{f payment.
Accor^din^g to sources, India a?n?d Ru/ssia ar?e lo\ok\ing at the possibility of m%akin%g the deal in Rupees and R-uble, c^o^nsi^d^er^in^g the p+r+ospect of a ba-n from the United States.
At the time o<f China's deal, t?h?e USA i`mpo`sed t%he ba\n.
Significantly, Russi_a made a~n S-400 m(issil(e deal with China i=n September.
Following this de'a'l, US P<resi<de<n<t Donald Trump decided t)o impose a ban o]n C'hina.
Due to th}i}s ban, it a#lm#ost b:e:cam:e impossible for China to buy t+h+e missile i^n US d`olla`r`s.
Ho]wev]er, during the last f(e(w y.ear.s, China had tri[ed t,o mak)e its currency Yuan an inte(rnati(onal currency similar to the d&olla&r.
Aft'er this i#n#itiativ#e, China is consistently tryi?ng globally m[a[ke the Yuan a,s a*n international c)urre)n)c)y similar to D)ollar, also like Euro, Yen and P<oun<d.
On the other hand, China has the largest r\e\s\erve o&f the America.n D~ol~la~r i)n the internatio(nal markets.
Chi/n/a wishes to mak\e Y^uan an international currency.
Un!ite!d States can impose C`A`ATSA (C^o^u^nterin^g Amer%ican Ad!ve!nt!ures T}hrough Sections) ba!n on this $5 billion mega defense deal.
Las-t month, t{he US im#pos#ed this ban o}n China fo#r purchasing S-400 Missile system.
India and Russia hav_e already s{t{a{rted seeking an alternative so~luti~on for th^is de*al since then.
Earlier, be[ca[u[se o;f the U\S b`an on the estimated $2 billion dea$l between I^n^dia an#d Russia for INS Ch&ak&ra's repair fare%d a nuted publicity.
Economic analysts op>i>ne t+hat to ov=erco=me this situation, India should use R#up#e#e-R#uble Exchange as th:e inte.r.na.tion.al currency fo$r this deal.
Informatively, all o_f Ind{i{a ’ s dea;ls with Russia until no,w have been denominated i|n Dol'la'r's.
How d\id t|he Un"ite"d States of America ’ s C!AATSA become a good t~hing?
Keepin_g Russia ’ s Adv?an?ce?d Defense Miss%il%e Syst'em in mind, P_re_sident Donald Trump approved the CAATSA law in A%ug%u%st . Th(e U>S ha`s drafted this l]aw to prevent Russia from wor@king a#ga#inst international interests at the global level.
It i.s u*nd*ersta*ndabl*e that this American l<aw has been p]rep]ar]ed c~ons~ideri~ng Russia in view.
Th)at i`n`c`lu`d`es Russia ’ s capture of Crime"a by a.t.tac.king Uk-raine in 2014, i*nterf*eren*ce in Syrian civi-l war and interference in 2016 U!S Presidential elect)ions.
Sud@denly a secret came ou:t which was thousands o.f yea/rs old.
Aja\b-G\h\aja\b (Fu]n an?d Interesting) Desk: This s,to,ry is abou(t a person from Tur|key w:ho made a major di"sc"overy w{hil{e doing his regular household work.
When t-h-e wall of hi;s basement broke and whil,e he wa[s r;epair;ing he came across a secret d^oor.
Th?rough the d'oor, he reached an underground tunnel, where h$e ca`me acros[s a city that w|a|s thousands of years o<l<d.
The images of this city sho}w}s that h\ow about 20,000 peop_le live\d in this underground city along wi,th their be@lon@g@in@gs an?d food it/ems.
600 acc{es{s points t"o t|he city.
The inc>id>ent is of 19}6}3, w~hen a Turkish ma}n li-ving i}n Cappadocia discovered this underground city.
While re~pa~iri~n~g the h!o!use, his basement w(all collapsed.
Un]de]r the d\e\p\t\h of 280 fe=e=t, he f'o'u'nd a=n underground city named Derinkuyu.
It{s depth w]a]s e)q)ua)l to tha(t of an 18-storey building.
The underground c'i'ty w;a;s on%ce home to 20.,0.00 people, with faci)lities inclu=ding ever'ythin'g from r~ooms, kitch$en$s, schools, churches, mosques, etc., Wi\th a ventilation system.
There are 6'00 gates t@o enter and ex(it this c>it>y.
To prevent outs/iders from in{filt{ra{t{i{n{g this underground city, f.o.rti.fied gates a}r}e p$r$ese$nt.
E?a?ch o*f its floor can be individually c"losed.
It i"s believed that th-is city was built during the Byza"ntine era between 7,80 to 1180 C*E so that people c/an b'e p%ro%te%cte%d fr#om the war between t^h^e Arabs and Byzantines and from na%t%ural disasters.
Bec;oming a tourist at;tra;cti;on:
Derinkuyu is not th$e onl#y underground city in t<he w!orl!d.
T;he;r;e are many o=t=he=r cities a=s such b?ut this is the largest amo"ngs"t them.
Only ha*lf o?f th:e c"ity can be reached, but this place h+as transformed in(to a popular tourist attraction in Ca+p+pa+doc+ia.
Due t?o its historical a;nd cultural importance, pe"ople come here t?o see i=t.

Th}e rocks which w:ere of th)e s}iz}e of a small car s`ca`r`e`d the team.
According to Bra=nson, i[t wa^s the scariest moment of hi}s life.
For th)e fir~st t"ime t~h~ey faced the scare of death.
Th@e r/ocks having size of small cars came cr)as)hing towards the~m.

The weather w.as clear and we we[re climbing uphil'l.
At t=h=a=t time, a p~or~tion of t%he opposite cliff had bro%ken away from the m_ou_nt_ain further up and h;ug;e boulders were bouncing t;owa;rd;s u&s

The truth t^hat emerged f;rom the post-mortem reports of th%e bir]ds.
International D\esk: Rumours hav|e arise`n as many birds are falling un%co%nscious a]nd co[l[l[id[ing with window panes i_n Minnesota, United States.
S+o+me peo@ple say that bir-d-s have become a pre=y to black magic, while some h-a-ve called th:is a_s a very rar'e incident.
As there is an increase in suc)h in!c!id!e!n!ts a#t many pl@ace@s in M$inne$s$ota, p$olice started thei~r investigation and solved the myst?ery behind such incidents.
The birds wer{e in}t}oxic}ated.
Police h:ad recei~v~e~d many com|p|l|ai|nts about t$h$e s\tr\a\n\g\e behaviour of the birds an&d them dropping onto the road.
Mi<n<nesota ’ s Gil\lbert police w$ere upset by ge>tting such calls a.nd started i-nvest-ig-a-ti-n-g the matter.
Gilbert police gathered all t*he birds that collided w,ith w&indow panes a-nd vehic\les and di~d po@s@t@-m@or@t@em examinations, in which the s:hock:ing disclosures were made.
These birds were intoxicated whe[n t,hey c(o(llid(ed with the windows and vehi`cles.
No>w the big question for t(he police wa;s to explain how th>e>se b-i-rds became intoxicated?
W$as anyone p/l/anning to kill the bir!ds?
Or was there a>n>y other f#acto#r behind i^t.
Birds were getti%ng drunk because o=f a fr)u)i)t.
Police solved this ca<s<e with the help o&f ex|perts.
It is told tha*t m)ost o:f t\h\e birds consumed a type of b#err#y (non-<fib<r<o<us fruit).
I%n England, such berries a{re called f{ermen{ted berries.
Sugar transforms to alco+ho+l by ferment:a:tion in such be<rrie<s.
As soon as the bir}ds ate thi}s f@r@u@i@t, the-y started to become d&r&u&nk.
A)s a result, many birds wer;e o=b=se=r=ved flying very l~ow.
These in)to)x)icate)d b{i{rds be@came deluded, and we/re th|er|efore colliding here and there.
Police p,ro,vid,ed i`nf`o`r`m`a`tion as to how to b}e safe.
Gi,lber,t police said th;at it was no@t possible t\o stop the bi`rds from eating th>is fruit.
The+r+efor+e, the pe}op}l}e were warned t*o keep th{em{selve{s safe.
The police say:s that the wi\ndo\ws with more r\efl\ec\tion a"nd windscreens can help in preventing t*hem fr=o=m colliding there.
The police infor&me&d the people through Facebook t{hat they should not pay at[tention t>o any rumour a[nd t^here i's no black magic.

In the first meeting it&self, Sac?hin h*ad p:red:i:cte:d about Prithvi Shaw.
Sp]or]ts Des{k: B,y scoring a century in his debut T|es|t match, Prithvi S`ha`w ha%s ga`in`ed a lot of fo)llowers from legends.
Prithvi Shaw is being compare_d t/o Sach<i<n Tendulkar.
The wa)y Prithvi has played bi=g innings a%t t_he school le-vel; Sachin too had b#ecome popular by playing su?ch innings.
Sachi]n Tendulkar co:ng:ra:tulated Prit-hvi Sh_a_w on his century by tweeting.
I!n the first meeting itself, Sachin h}ad predicted abou`t Prit*hv*i S\ha\w's bright future.
Sachin Tendulkar was also happy t;o see Prithvi Sh<aw ’ s g|rand s?ta?rt
Sachin ha^d prais.ed Prithvi.
Sachin remembered th{e day when h&e first saw Prithv(i ’ s b?at?ti?ng a)n)d had spoken about h}im.
Sharing h>is e>xperie>nce, S~achin said that about 10 years ag#o h?is friend Ja#gd#i#sh Chauhan had asked h[i[m to see P&r&it&hvi ’ s batting.
Chauhan had said ‘ T>his young p#lay#er want_s to mee-t you and it will b{e great i{f you me+et him . ’
Sac:hin acce`p`ted the reques^t o@f his fri^e^n^d and came to see Prithvi's batting.
Sachin sa?id that he st'il'l remember%s that h$e told h"is f@ri@e@nd that this kid woul{d play for India one day; h(e informed tha)t he told to h@is friend “ Yo@u ar?e seeing a future Indian cricketer ”.
T;o which, Sa!chin ’ s fri/end responded, “ R(ea(l(ly? ”
To whic:h Sac<h<in s>a>id that “ Mark m\y words, thi{s bo|y will definitely play for India ”.
Sachin talked abo_u_t Pri:thv:i Shaw ’ s grea`t`est strength.
While praising Pr:it:hv:i Sh"aw, Sachi=n said, “ f,rom what I have se-en, h]e (Prithvi Sha(w) is a q{uick learner . ”
Any pla-y-er having t|alent is a different thing, but i>t is more impo$rta$nt f:act t~hat what y@ou ar!e doing with that talent.
If you wan[t to become a successful i[nternati[ona[l c]rick]eter then it i>s necessary to be able t,o learn qu%ic%kly.
I`t i,s n]e]c]essary to have the ability to p@la@y for a longer time on different grounds a>nd different conditio(ns
I think th.a.t Prithvi Shaw ha=s t%h%e abi:lity to play f[or a longer time in different conditions an&d that is Prithvi ’ s grea:te:st streng;th.
Sa=chin s.ai.d that he f$ound Pri|thvi Shaw ’ s hand - eye coord&i&na&tion was amazing.
Th{e way in w[hic[h h_e reads t^he line and lengt+h of the ball is rare amo-ng players.

A(not(her astonishing fact about Dr. Ambedkar '.s a:dv:o:c:ay for national language i#s th{at th/e Chief Architect of the Consti/tutio/n, Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar and few ot{her Muslim and South I'ndian c_o_nst_itu_tion_a_l members proposed to desig]n]a]t]e Sanskrit as t'he national lang.uage.

In view of th`e discussion of tha/t day and th@e report published i?n t\h\e "National Herald" on 11 September 1.949, it can be estimated that there wa[s a suppo}rt f]or Sans$k$r$i$t langu(a(ge.
Unfortunate_ly, e!ven today we a>re n(ot able t|o designate a national language.
T[h[ere are 22 official Indian l@an@gua@ges, inc$ludi$ng Hindi, Gujarati, Sanskrit, U{rdu, in o@u@r Con&stituti&on, but t$he$re i-s n=o national language.
