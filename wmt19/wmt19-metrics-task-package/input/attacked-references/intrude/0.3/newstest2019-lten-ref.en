Then, Linas Belevičius, a&dvo&ca&te o,f MG Baltic, declared that i=n order to ens/u/r/e appropriate defen)se for a p:e:rson, the p%a%nel of j'ud'ges must allow the new advocate to get familiar with the cas!e file and a!sked t;o post[p[one t-he he|ar|ing.
“ In order t<o ensure per`so`n ’ s defense, he must get famil^iar wi:t:h th\e m,a,t,er,ia,l in t^he criminal case file.
It is no/t just a formal g!ath!eri!ng, ” L;. B~e~l~ev~ičiu~s noted.
The n,ew advocate A. Dor*oševa*s admitted that he ha]d not yet h$a$d time t\o ge>t familiar e=i=t=her with the statement of charges o&r the case fi}le in full.
In the previous hearing the suspect Š#. Gustainis informed the co@ur@t th%at he refu!sed his adv(o(c(at(e a#s he w\as not able to p|a|y him.

Custodians o_f eth.ics: T^he Board of the Liberal Movement is righ,t about the action o`f the Vi'ln'ius branch
“ Decisions taken b-y th?e Board are in line with th]e Articles of Assoc\iation, ” Vytautas T!amoši!ūn!a!s, the head o|f t*h*e C|omm|i|ssi|on, said to BNS after t;h;e Co[mmi[ssi[on meeting.
“ That decision o:f ou>r>s w"as not something new.
W&e, as th@e Com|mi|ssi|on, gav.e ou_r explanation already in July, when the issue about Pa+g+ė+giai an)d Utena h*ad come up.
We said t\hen that according t"o the Art{icl{es o)f Association, this iss-u-e is wit{hin the comp%eten%ce of the Board.
And if th.e Board decides th@at a part[ic[ula[r branch ca}n behave as it wishe.s - to ru!n w`i`th a c#omm#ittee, a#nd the Board a|p|pr|ove|s o'f that, then that bra}nch can run s+o, but if the Board d}e}ci}des that the party will run everywhere with party lists, w;hich is what the B^oard h.as deci$ded, then i)t is a dec[is[ion for all bran:c:hes to form party l"ists.
An|d if s>om>e>o>ne does no^t agre@e with t'he Bo)a)rd, then there i$s a possibility to suspend membership and run with a committee, '{' he a_dded.
According to V+. Tamošiūnas, now the B@o@a@r@d of the p%arty i]s to de|cide on i-ts further course of a$c$ti$on.
On 1_7 Octo@b@er, th.e Boar]d of t;he political party Liberal Movement can'celled the decisi@on o(f the Viln(ius city branch t!o parti"cipate in the municipal elections not with a party list, but wi(th a list of an elections committee, which i*s currently b*ei*ng f(or(m(ed.
I}n the opinion o&f t!he Board o|f the party, the decision o%f the liberals in the capit?al city to participate i}n the elections i'n the fo.rm o-f a public elections committee is in breach o>f the Ar+ti+c+les of Association of t%he party, de\c\is\ions o[f the Board.
The Vilnius branch wa#s to waive i}t}s intentions to participate in the municipal el@e@cti@ons with a commi!t!tee l$i$s$t b&y 3\1 October.
However, t$he branch f+ai+led to d}o that.
Aušr%inė Armo_naitė, former head o{f the branch, a member o*f the Seimas, has already l^ef^t t/he Liberal M%ovement.
T*he M(ayo(r of Vilnius, Remigijus Ši(maš(iu(s, former chairman of th.e Liberal Move}me}nt, wh[o intends to run fo&r th!e second term a;s th)e Mayor o:f Vilnius, ha&s alr<eady introduced th{e team and ideas of the public elec(t(i(o(n(s committee “ For Vilnius we are p=r=oud of! ”.
He al;so has left t!he pa{r{ty.
Elec|tions for municip(al councils and off\ic\es of mayo.r.s will b)e held in March next year.
Residents of a Nort=h Indian vill>age used a tr?act?o?r t%o crush a tigress, wh?o had torn u/p a man, the offi%cer%s r:epo:rted o/n Monday.
Forest officer Mahavir Kaujlagi said villagers circled the f!e!male tiger a@ft@er it killed a man working i}n t#he fi|elds late Sund<a<y, a\n\d when the tiger tried to e`scape, th,e villagers c@rus@hed i"t und#er t+he wheels of a tractor.
Villagers said t/h/e tiger had injured ano+ther y*ou*ng man in an attack about 1&0 day=s a-go.
The v>illage is in@si@de t}h}e Dud&hw&a Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur K,hir,i area, approximately 250 kilometers southeast o\f Lucknow, the st[ate capital of U$tt$a$r Prade}sh.
Killing a ti&ger i#n protected ar_eas is illegal.
Th~e res"e"rv"e ’ s director R)a)mes)h Pandey said that the cas(e i%n question would be reported t}o the police un^d^er th!e Wildlife Protection Act.
I"n April, villagers had beaten up a&n&oth&e&r tig]e]r i@n Nighasan area of the st"at"e of Ut$tar Pradesh; it su,ffer,ed severe in+j+u+ries.
The tiger is I%ndi%a's na/t/i/ona/l animal; it i|s categorized as endangered sp>e>cies un/der the Wildlife Protection A+c+t.
Last year ’ s g}o}v}ernme}nt dat_a show t&h&at, in th]e last three years, at least on%e p"er"s"on was killed per day in confrontations w@i@t@h wild t,igers o:r el)eph)a)nts.
The human c$o$nflicts with tigers has gradually increased since the 8th de{cade, when India started a tig~er con=s=e=rvation pr+ogr+a+m that carved out san`ct`u`arie`s i;n national parks, an!d m:ad:e i)t a crim&e to kill a b(ig cat.
Though methods for c%ounti%ng tigers have chang-ed, a census su+g+gest+s t{he po~p~ul~atio~n of about 1=,800 tigers t^he^n g`re`w to 2,226 in 2014.
It i(s proposed to mark ca/ts and dogs wi{t{h m~icroc~h~ips mandatorily
Kę's'tuti's Mažeika, the Chairman o<f t`he Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, and ot(her m?emb?ers of the S/eim/a/s reg{is{ter{e{d dra/f/t amendments to th@e Law on t*he Welfare and Protection of A\nimal\s, pr&opos&in&g to ma]rk cats and dogs with subcuta]n]eous microchips un(der the mandatory procedure.
“ We p!r!op!os!e that cats and dog~s would have t=o b,e marked wi-th subcutaneous micr(ochips, and their registration and marking would b<e or[gan[ized b_y l'o'ca'l municipalities, the Ministry of Agr'i'cultu'r'e and the State Food and Veter@in@a@ry Service.
In 2019 marking of all d#og#s, i>n 20?20 al)so of a#ll cats w|oul|d be fu)n)ded by t|he state, therefore, people would no{t have problems a[nd the c_os_ts would b\e covered f'rom special state financial as[s[ig[n[ment[s, ” said Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of the Seimas Com-mi-t-tee o;n E#n#v#ir#o#nm#e#ntal Protection.
The ame.ndmen.ts to the La%w are aimed a\t dealing wit`h the need o%f systemic marking of pet(s.
It is expected tha(t it will help to avoid problems caused b.y irresponsible p'et owner,s, illega!l breeders o*r sell$ers.
It is p@re@limi@n@arily as?s?es?sed that b'ase'd o*n th;e a@ve@rage price of the chip a&nd the ch}i}p implantation se[rv[ice, which will b'e about EUR 5, all pet owners will be compensated dur:in:g t/h/e transitional period.
The t+ot+al price o{f marking a`ll pets can amount up t\o E?UR 6 million.
I<t is planned that the use of the funds w&ill span o$ver the period of thre|e ye+ars and wi@ll amount t/o E>UR 2 million per yea*r.
It i's expected that th<e funds for t"he ma!rking programs w,i,ll b$e assi@gned throu?g?h the Special P(ro(g(ram of the Municipalities for Su%ppor%ti%ng E<n<vi<r<onment<al Protection, the in{c{ome of which w"i"l"l g<row significantly this year due to increase in taxes on natural resources and redistribution of f{un{d{s.
Municipalities w]ill be able to u$se these funds not only f;or mar.ki.n.g of cats a<nd d?og?s, but also for castration an%d other prog@ram@s.
Acco(rd(ing t=o K. Mažeika, the mandatory marking i=s practiced i&n almost all Member States of the Eu)ropean Union, th$a$t al_so all\ows protecting p'ets (as l.o.s.t p+ets c>an be easi"l"y returned to their owners), and s~ave~s pet owners ’ time as they usu+ally need much ti@me an/d money in s}earc}h for a runaway and l"ost pet.
B;e;sides, the E(U legal acts say th]at one can travel o=n=l=y wit#h marked pets.
Mark[in[g als}o obligates the owner to take ca&re o]f t$he pet responsibly throughout its life.
Previous proposals t:o impose mandatory marking w/ere objected t>o, as it w@as proposed t<o fi{nanc{e relevant prog]ra]ms wi:th people ’ s money.
“ Th*e current model should be spared this criticism, as i#t i(s proposed to fi)na)nce pet protect*ion with increased inc_o_me in the p=r=ogr=am for supp&ort&in&g envir\onm\ent\a\l protection and to give the right t=o do the marking not o:nly t;o vete"ri"na"ria"n"s but also t"o public activists, i:.e . p'erson's in an#imal shelters w'ho have taken special cou;r;se;s in the Veterinary Academy, '/' th-e authors of the draft s(ay.
T\h\e dra&ft la|w has b=een regist*er*ed b.y a group of memb|e|rs of t/he Seimas representing va=ri=ous fac<ti<ons i.n the Seimas: Kęstu|tis Mažeika, Algimantas Dumbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rim:a:s Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

“ W+e have a lot o<f f\rien\ds in Vilnius, o,u,r countries have always been on goo<d t>e>rms.
Lithuania i%s one of the countries with the best basketball traditions in th"e w^orl^d, there+fo+re, it wi~l~l be a}n honor f@or u$s to play he=re.
We hope Vilnius peo\ple will b)e our fa_ns . ”
Th)e Ko>s>ovo team could not c#ome to Ukraine as these countri/es do not have an"y diplomatic re%lations%hip.

I"t is most probably only a coincidence, but t+he glam<o<ro<u<s bro@w@n@-eye@d actress B@rigita Arsobaitė k[e[eps getting roles rel*ated to liars.

Decision on whether t&o w(ri(te o'ff EUR 100 million of overdue emigrants ’ ta$xe$s i.s to be ta=k=en
O+n Tuesday, the Seima/s accepted a?n amendment t)o t>he L`a`w on Declaration of the Place of Residence proposed by Ramūnas Kar&ba&uskis, th(e leader of the “ f@arme@rs ” p]ar]t]y, f@or consideration.
56 memb(ers o#f the S(eimas voted in favor o`f it, 9 - a!ga!i!ns!t, an'd 25 abstained.
The Sei&mas will continue consideration of th_e a/m/endm/e/n/t/s on 6 D<ecember or later, a/ft/e/r it gets a^n opinion from the Gove+r+nment.
R. Ka*rbaus*k*is says that these payments a>c>cr>u>e f*or people who did not declare t>heir departur[e f&rom Lithuania.
According to the me&mber o;f the Seimas, o@n@e person f%ail%s to pay about EUR 1,000 of taxes i.n a p'er'io'd of th~ree years, and currently th]e nu-mber o]f such persons is abou~t 100,000.
A social-democrat Algirdas Sysas feared that i?n t~his wa[y the Seimas “ will enc<o<ura<ge so,me people t(o defy their duties ” by dec.lar.i.ng departure and then no taxes wou+ld b%e cha~rged.
A conservative Antanas Matulas, me>m>be>r of the Com)m)itte)e o#f Healt/h Affairs, no*ted that Lithuanians, who live a(br(oad, a&buse the situation as, p|aying a small health i$n$su$r$anc$e ta=x, t^he^y co@m@e to L~ith~ua~n~ia for medical treat]ment a!n!d receive the same services a@s the residents who pay this tax.

A v|ideo of a slipping b'a'b'y bear, that ha]s beco?me vir`a`l online, reveals a serio\us problem
I`t has be&e&n fi!l!m!e!d how a mother bear climbs a st<eep snow-covered s^lope, while her c,u,b keep]s cli'm'bing, sliding d/own and again persistently climbing.
The video ha{d m@any rev[i[e[w[s and comments.
People ad*m*ire*d th!e little bear ’ s persistency - having slipped multiple ti$me$s, it u$sed to r"esum"e i<ts jour!ney towa'rds its mother.
I}t does not succeed at first, bu%t the cub does not e]ven t*ry to give u:p and fi+n+al+ly reaches i$ts goal.
The vi~deo really ca&pt&u&re&s attention b-ut it also reveals the danger p*eo*ple cause for a:ni:m:a:ls.
Sc.ien.ti.st.s say th#a#t o=ne h.as also to sp\ea\k that people ’ s wish to get to know wildlife sometimes can b/e h]armful.
“ I|t i*s obvious t[o m$e that the d~r~one scared the bears greatly.
Thei!r movemen|ts show th\at they panic.
If there had b[een no drone fly?ing a=ro=u=nd, they would have probabl`y chosen a safer way o@r wou-ld h.ave take/n it slower o{r with more caution.
It i=s a perfect example o;f h!ow drones should n(o(t be used, ” the ecologist Mark Ditmer s#a#id t)o th$e publ~i~cat~i~o~n “ The Verg,e ”.
Some time ago, M. D)itm)e)r an(d his col@leagu@es res^ear^ch^ed how drones were a`ff`ec`ting bears.
H`eart monitors wer~e placed o;n the animals.
Wh'en a drone u(s(ed t*o come close, so~me bears started runni!ng, whil+e others did not, but the h,ear,ts of al,l of them w}e}re pounding with fear.
Scientists advise to us&e drones for f@il@mi@ng an)imals in a re.sponsibl.e m|a|nner, no:t to fl&y too close, not to cause noise and not to fl#y where that i!s forb(i(dden.

The document indicates that V. Yanukovych ha[s the right t#o t&ake part i*n the hearing b,y way o[f a video conferen(ce.
O*n 3=0 Oc`tobe`r, the K!iev court announc,ed havi]ng finished debates in V. Yanukovych ’ s case.

R:e:st:rict:i:o:ns on cogeneration power pl;an;ts appealed before the C,onstituti,onal Court
The Seimas opposition, as pr+omi+sed, appealed against the dec/i/sion o*f the r>u>ling pa'rties t'o pass the l-a-w o}n a possibility to stop construction o~f waste-to-energy plants before t}he Constitutional Court (C`C).
On Tue~s~d~ay, the S.ei.m.as opposition fact+ion of the Homeland Uni;on – Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) not"i"fie"d tha\t a group o}f me&m&bers of the Seima%s addr?essed th'e CC with a*n a%pplic%at%ion f.o.r investigating whether t.h.e amendments to the L.a.w on Waste Management ado:p:t:e:d by the ruling parties are in line with the Constitution.
“ The members o^f the Seimas emphasize t^hat provisions o.f the law aim t=o challenge t$he currently ongoing proj(ects of waste i~nci~ne~r~ation fac}i}l}i}t}i}es, instructing t/he Government t^o impose new restrictions (2&0 k<m distance to a resi}denti}al territory) on waste-to-energy plants t?ha?t started t[o be constructed in Vilnius and Kau=nas before the effective dat:e o#f the la&w, ” the notification say_s.
It adds that “ the members of the S(eima(s note t.h.a.t taking into acco{unt how th}e law words the prohibition t<o c>on>st>ruct was=te management o_bj_ects o_f national importance (i+.+e . de-te-rmine-s a distance and defines the c@oncept of “ residential terr^itory ”), a c}onclu}sio}n i~s to be made that this prohi(b(ition disproportionately restricts o>r even d|en|ies the ver`y e&ssenc&e of the r(igh(t to perform economic activities related to burning o)f was(te t&o pr.o.duce energy, as t;he established cr-iteria are worded so that, ha>ving in mind t%h%e population density and dist)r)ib)ut)i)on i=n Lithuania, construction o`f such objects w>o>ul>d be practically impossible in the w~h~ole te#rri#tory of the country ”.
The app'lica'tion says that the ad)op)t)e)d l`aw is contrary t.o th,e constitutional principle o/f the rule of law.
“ Th{e CC has indicated fo'r a n@umber of times tha`t legal a_cts do n^o^t apply to those le"gal fac#ts and consequences that occurred befo+re the effe>c>t>i>ve date of a newly adopted l#e#gal act.
I+n this cas=e, the Government i)s given powers t]o apply the law retroactively, f]o]llowin]g a]n indefinite criterion.
Imposing such legal regulation v:i:ol:ate:s t|he constitution principles of legal certainty, le_ga_l safety, protection o%f le^giti^m^ate expectations, consequently, the constitution}a}l principle o[f t&he rule of l=a=w, ” th=e ap*plic*a*ti*on indicates.
It also not^es that b?ig financial investments have already been made t]o the projects of Vi-ln-ius a?nd Kauna)s cogeneration p!o!wer plants.
S_to_p_pi_ng o@f t)he currently on<g<o<i<ng project-s would i'nf'lict a financial loss of hundreds of mil&l&ions on the Sta,te, the Lithuanian population would s?uf?fer hu,ge losses, too - heating prices would increase, the gro#wing volumes of waste i.n dumpsites w#ould result i@n increased en\vir\onment\a\l pollution.
T@he application to the C`C h*a*s bee>n signed by members from Seimas TS;-;LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic factions and b,y Algirdas Butk$ev$ičius, d$eput$y hea{d o[f a ruling So]cial Democratic Labor faction.
A couple o=f w~eeks ago, the Seimas gave 71 votes, mo:st:ly from the ruling part#ies, in order t"o rejec{t the veto of the President Dalia Grybauskaitė o"n the a}dopte}d amendments to t{he Law on Waste M{an{a{gem{ent, providing fo#r the right of t'he Go\vernm\en\t to stop alr(e(ady started const#ruct#i#on o+f cogeneration powe@r plants, also se/t a buffer z#on#e of 20 k?m fro}m residential locations f)o)r construction of suc%h power plants.
T,h,e amendments to the l=aw repeated adopted by t@h@e Se?im?as will come i"nto force o)n 1 January 20&19 . By the w]ay, t/he rul-i-n-g parties already propose to drop the 20 km r&e&strictio&n.
It is pla!nned to consider th#is pro+po+sal al|ready in the autumn session of the Se)imas.
But the Sei"mas does not plan t;o cancel the righ)t o&f the Government t_o stop already started p>r>o>j>ects.
The CC will exam{in{e the case i@n t;h;e order o"f sequenc!e, which is a year la/t/er a}t the earliest.
LeBron James ’ stats i;n Laker%s club, which r.a.is.es conc:e:rn:s, revealed
The start of LeBron Ja;mes ’ career in Los Angeles L)aker)s club i|s n.ot a&s expected by hi,m himself, t.he team an@d basketball fans.
Lakers started the seas%on w$i$th f.our wins and six losses, and such a w\eak start re?s?ul?ted in ru*mo*rs that the coach Luke Walton ca.n b*e f\ired.
Still, su!c!h tal#ks were silenced b*y Mag~ic J*ohnso*n, the President of Basketball Ope_ra_t_i_o_n_s, wh_o declared the coach wo.u.ld no*t be f)i)red, but better play is expected.
The b{ig{ge{st star of t,he team L. Jam>e>s shoul@d hav(e a look at himself, t-o-o.
T%he player ’ s stats is i%m%pr%e%ssi%ve as u"sua"l, though - 26.8 points, 7|.6 rebounds an=d 7$.$7 assis?t?s.
But t#hat is no't the wh{ole truth.
Dur_i_n_g the first te`n matches o[f the season, other figures came up, showing that Lakers p;l;ay be}tte}r w/hen L|. James i]s n:o:t on the court.
+/- s"tats, showing the d"ifferenc"e i-n p^oin^ts scored or m_is_sed by the team when certain players are o|n the court, i,s not favorable f_or the pl%a%yer.
When L). James was o#n the ground this season, Lakers missed 30 poin(ts m$ore than the|i|r o"ppone"nts.
Mea>n>wh>ile, w\he\n he wa<s on the bench, L`ake`rs scored 1=9 points more than th]e]i]r opponents.
Currently, Lakers have j_ust t/he 13*th s*tand*in*g in t^he Western Conference, but several wi*n*s can change everything.

V_. Ač/ienė about detention o#f R. Ačas: I believe my hu.sb.a.n.d is i=nn=ocen=t and I believe i;n law enforcement
`*` That was the m&o&st unexpected t!hing to me t{hat I could never think o#f.
O@n t+h+e ot`he`r hand, the authorities probably are jus"t doing their jo+b.
Each of u$s a{re doing o!u!r job.
I believe in law enforcement a:ut:h:o:ri:tie:s, I believe m[y husband, t,h,at eve[rything i;s just an%d f^ai^r, t+hat h*e has not taken an,y unf(air actions, ” V. Ačienė told BNS.
R. Ačas w`a`s de\tai\ne\d b-y the Special Investigation Service (SIS) on Monday - the law enforc)ement a$u$th$ori$ti$es suspect th;at h@e, while being the Director o/f the Administration o*f the Raseiniai Municipality, t&ook a bribe of b>i>g value, an)d in exc:ha:nge he could have crea=ted e.x.c.e.p.t.io.nal co*nd*iti*o*ns fo$r a private company t"h"a"t s`igned a contract with the Ra*s*e*ini*ai bus fleet controlled by the municipal[ity.
It is suspected that representatives of private co:mpa:nies dir@ectly paid of.f R. A^č^as o-r were involved i{n disguising bribes a-s various financial oper^ati^ons.
I'n April t~his year, t!he Counci`l o)f the Raseiniai District Municipality dismissed R. A'čas from t$h$e o'ffic'e of th$e head of the Administration at the third attemp^t after a statement of dis&tru&st in him ha_d been made.
In March t"his year, a former mem!be!r of the Order an{d Justice became a member of t[he newly founded S[o[ci[al Democratic L)a)b)o)r Pa!rt!y o$f Lithuania head!ed by Gedim$inas Kirkilas, he susp^ended his membership i/n thi-s political party on Monday.
R. A#č#a#s unsuccessfully ran for the of'fice of t*he may+or a+s a representative of the electoral c!om!mitte!e “ Ta"vo Raseiniai ” several yea<rs ago.
V%. Ačienė say_s that her husband was not g'o'ing to run f}or th=e Raseiniai mayor next year, but h-e has not decided y:et on pa'rtici'p'ati'o'n in the elections f'o'r t?he mun)i)cipal councils.
V. Ačienė wa,s ele`cted to the Seimas on the li+st o'f the Lithuanian F?a?rmers an)d Greens Union, she is a member o*f the Seimas Anticor!r!u!p!tion C%ommis%s%io%n.
The politician said she wo@u@l@d wait f~or further a"ct"io"ns o&f the law enforcement aut@h@o@rit@i@es - he/r decision on rem}o}v}in}g herself from t*he work in the Commission w@ould depend on th}e}m.
"I am r}eal}ly not taking any f-ast decisions today, I wi"l"l make up my m+ind t>his wee%k, I t?hin?k.
I will se"e, i@f it becomes ne*cessa*ry, depending o}n the t>ype of a@ccusati@o@n@s, i^t is clear that I will have to take so}m}e deci=sion.
I"t i!s probably necessary that I would stay away fr+om all thos,e m\atters i-nve-stigate-d in the Anticorruption Commission, bu|t again - ti%m%e will reveal the truth, ” s=h=e s=p=o=ke.
Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, a representative o#f the conservatives in o@ppos@ition i!n the S^eim^as, urged the Spe{aker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis an[d t$he leade#r o#f the “ farmers ’ ” party Ra]m]ūnas Karbauskis to di@ssociate from statements o.f the f"act"i"on collea"g"ue Vida Ačienė and to remove her fr}om the Seimas Anticorruption C&omm&i&ssion, tr~an~sfe~rring her to an(ot(he(r Seimas co{mmittee or commission.
She says that further work o"f V. Ač[ienė in the Seimas Anticorruption Commission `(` w/o/uld c&a&us&e g)round)e)d lack of trust in the soc~ie~t~y and wou(ld discredit the w^ork o.f the important parliamentary supervisory commi+s+sion".

Gr*yb*auska*i*t*ė urges C#hina t;o create a m%ore favorable inv.estme.nt environment for the EU business
Th!e Pr]e]si]d]ent Dali;a Grybauskaitė invites Ch$ina t)o create a more f?avor?able in@vestm@e@nt environment for the European Union (EU) investments, t{o ease conditions for foreign impor!t.
In the Ch,inese import exhibition i<n Shangh,a,i, while opening t*h*e trade a)nd i$nv$estm$e$nt forum, D<. Grybauskaitė accentuated t{hat wi"tness"ing sig.n.s of slowdown in economy, the common go/a/l o]f Europe a-nd China should be “ to unite ef\for\t\s t$o stop spreading of protectionism i,n t\he world ”, aimi]ng a't essential reasons of t{h{e tension caused by trade wars, “ overproduction and unfair co$mpet$i$ti$on ”.
“ The commitment o|f C)h)ina t}o create a more attra{ctive, op|en envi]ronment fo"r investments is very important for t{he European Union - it is important i_n negotiating for a tra{de ag=r=e=e=ment with China.
It i]s i$mportant to finalize this tra?de agreement a;s s@o@on a%s possible, ensuring t[hat foreign business wo;uld feel welcome a^n^d s*e*c*ure here, also by way of strengthening intellectual property pr,otection, ” sai(d D. Grybauskaitė.
According to her, o`peni`n`g of China is importa_nt not only for Europe, but a.lso for Chin=a, as we[l[l a{s for t.he g~l~obal ec;on;omic growth.
The L_ithua_n_i_a_n lead+e+r emphasized th`at i=nv=estme=n=t transparency must be “ ab~ove interests of any bu<sines<s group ”.
`^` T<r<anspa<rency, supremacy of laws, strict adherence to international agreements - tha"t must be essential fo$r th`e envi[ronment o@f new i:nv:est:m:ent relationships, ” D. Grybauskaitė u"n"der"l"ined.
“ Corrupted capital flows sho}u}ld not b=e welcom)e in a@n@y coun&t&ry o}f th%e world - n[ot only here or in our countries, ” she adde*d.
B&y hosting the import exh?ibiti?on, Chi,na attempts to mitigate the criticism that it avoids opening i~ts m%a%rket an[d protects on/l/y its own c\o\mp\a\nies.
Leaders o(f a number of c]o]un]tries part/ic/ip/a/t/e i\n th^e ex*h*ib*ition, over 2,800 companies from 130 countries a.nd regions in the world, incl@udi@n@g Lithuania.
According t]o the L`it`huania`n Department o:f Statis{ti{cs, currently China is the 25!th among export par/t/ners.
Las%t year, the e%xp%ort of Lithuania t'o China grew by 50 percent - t`his amounted t?o EU;R 1>80 million.
M-ea-nwh-ile, th+e volume o*f impo:rt from China exceeded EUR 820 million.
Some officials a}re concerned that Chinese i%nve%stm%ent%s in Lithuania can b`r`ing undesired political i>nf>luen>ce, and th"e peculiar at.tention of Beijing t{o the Ea^ste^rn Europe undermines t$h$e EU unity.

The cause of L_io_n Air plane cr'ash r'ev'eal'ed: relatives o\f t'he victims are furious
Data fro_m a black bo#x retrieved from the crashed plane of t(he Indo-nesian airl\in\e\s Lion Air has r-ev-e-al-e-d the aircraft experienced problems wit.h i-ts speed indicator on a%t least four of its last fli\gh\ts, i}n}ve}st}igator}s reported o_n Monday.
The head of Indonesia ’ s National Transportation Safety Commit(t(ee (KNKT) Soer]j]anto Tjahj.on.o told that the plane h=a=d suffered similar problems on i-ts la|st four flights, includ~in~g t%h%e fatal one, wh>e>n on 29 October t$h$e plane plunged into th_e Jav&a Sea soo\n after t'h'e take-off i=n Dja{k{ar{ta.
The disaster killed a{l{l 189 people o?n bo{ar{d.
Many of the mass med{i{a reported problems during the previous flig}ht of Bo"eing 7*37 MAX 8 f[rom Denpa#s#a#r t<o the capital c~it~y of Indonesia.
“ Wh`en we ope%n%ed the black box, yes in)deed t)he t\e\chni\c\al problem was the a;i;rsp;e;ed or, i*n ot\h\e\r words, the speed o|f the plane, ” S. Tj#ahjono said i]n the pr/ess conference.
“ Dat,a fr!om t}h}e black box showed t[h[a[t the two flights before Den-pasa-r-J-akar-t-a a#l#s#o experienced the same pr_o_blem, ” he added.
“ The<r<e have be?en lot[s o>f rumors on social media.
No'w, w>e want to e"xplain that in the blac<k box there were (da+t+a remaining) about four flights t<h<a<t ex@perienc@e@d probl]e]ms with t~he airspeed i'n'd'icator, ” the head o*f KNKT indicated.
During a meeting with vi@c@t@i@ms ’ family members, S_. Tjahjono said that in`fo`rm`a`ti`on o]f the flight dat'a recorder w/as consistent w@ith reports t>h>at af/t/er the plan|e took off for its last flight, it$s speed an:d al;ti;tu;de were erratic.
Th_e s$e$archers hav`e not found the secon*d black box yet, which records th>e talks i]n the pil{ots ’ cockpit.
Li"on Air indicated t/h/a/t a{ft{e{r a technical failure was ide,n,t,if,ie,d during the flight f~rom Bali t~o D'jak'arta, it wa^s repaired a[s per manafacturer ’ s recommendations.
Rusdi Kirana, a co-founder of the company, was not inv>i>t>ed t\o sp)ea)k b&y the Minister o@f Transport Bud_i Kar$y$os S!umadi, who mod_erated the m/eet/ing between relatives and the officials who a?r?e overseeing the effort o&f search f&or the plane and victim r.ema.in.s and t<he accident investigation.
Bu=t he st{ood and bowed his h~e~a~d a_ft_e_r angry and d?is?tra?ugh?t f|amily memb*e*rs demanded that R. Kirana, who with his brother Kusnan founded Lion Air i+n 199;9, i~den~ti~f~y himself.
“ Lion Ai(r has f^a^iled, ” said a man who introduced himself as the father o<f passenger S:h:andy Joha,n Ramadhan, who had bee{n a prosecutor i_n th_e isla_nd, where th%e p$l$ane would have l=anded.
“ I want Mr'. Rusd=i Kirana and h;is tea_m to pay a^ttent^ion, ” he stres~se~d.
- Since the time of the c;risis, I w!as n%e%ver co+n+t+a+c+te+d by Lion A&ir.
W{e lost our child, but Lio_n A#ir has not sh%own a|n|y empa,thy to us . ”
After the meeting, R. Kirana l)ef)t in a hurry, av#oi#ding quest%i%ons f<ro<m reporter`s.
Ma?ny families a@r@e waiting for results of t/he lon]g process of i%dentif%yi%ng victims.
P<ol<ic<e medical experts have received nearly 1\40 bodybags o`f human r'em'ain's.
Only 1|4 victims ha-v-e been identified so fa%r.
The families have b;ee;n asking wh@y the two-month-old plane w~a~s gi!ven fli|ght c"l"e"ara"n"ce at all, given that there was a fa'ilu'r'e re~p~orted on a f&li&g&h&t from Bali to Jakarta on 2&8 October, where it descended rapidly righ(t after the t~ake~-~off, muc[h t&o the terror of p[ass[enger[s o:n board.
“ Lio>n A}ir said that this fault was f|ixe|d.
I,s i%t tru#e the problem was cleared? ” a s)o)n of a victim aske`d.
- If n+o+t, techn#ician#s in charge must be he#l#d respo;n;sibl;e.
The law i_s a_b_so_lute because t~he~y have stated that the plane was cleared t;o take o#ff a)gain.
The^se bad technicians must be processed b/y law t>o prevent pl)an)e accidents fr;om continuing i'n Indonesia . ”
S[. Tjahjono s#aid t@he lar+ge amount of small debris and the fact that debris wa}s found i,n a relatively s@ma@ll area ind[icate that t:he pl@an@e probably hit the water at a very hi{g{h speed.
“ The plane wa]s intact when it p<lun<ged t@o t.he sea.
It did not explode in the air, and t]he aircraft engine was running at high RPM w!he!n i^t touc<he<d t}he wa`te`r - i,t '%s marked b#y t/he l'o's's o"f al?l the blades of the turbine, ” the official explained.
The Lion Air crash is the wors)t a$irli$n$e disaster in Indonesia since 199=7, w#hen 234 people died on a Gar/ud/a fl|ight nea&r M>e>d>an.
Rescuers came to h-el-p to ext^ra^ct peopl>e from crashed cars: a minor among t!he vic:t:im:s
O,n Monday evening, two c@ars - B@M@W and Mercedes-Benz - c*olli*ded on the road Vėžaič?i?ai - Plung;ė, near Tilvika>i.
The c\ar\s had a head-on co*llision, three victims w?ere repo&rt&ed.
I,t has been reported that B$MW d^ri^ver, woma^n born in 1999, wen?t to the opposite la!ne a,n,d had a head-on collis%ion w-ith Mercedes-Benz, which had a f(at(h(er, bor"n in 1967, and a daughter, born i$n 2!005.

Pr&esi&de&n&t ’ s Office: n?o artificial e<asing regarding referendums i~s necessary
If the Seimas approves o}f t$he proposal o(f thos=e in power to l?o?wer t<he referendum threshold for Chapter I of the Con>sti>tuti>on, which i|s currently s>ubj>e>ct t#o stronger p/r/otec/t/ion, t_he President would veto the amendments, he_r advisor Mindaugas Lingė s<ays.
“ Mo`re than a half of the population voted f=or the Co!ns!titution - suc~h i]s t&h&e requirement.
T,he,re,f,o,re, i?t?s amendment, pa!r!t!icula!rly of th}e articles in i\ts Chapter I, should b&e su.bject to no less majority vote.
It can be eas!ily predicted that the President wo(u(ld really v<eto it," i.ntern.al policy advisor t)o Dal(ia Grybauskaitė sai>d to Žinių r|a|dijas on Tuesd>a>y.
He emphasized that Chapter One of the Constitution de{fi{n{es fundame-nta-l matters o]f th$e state - the language, the fl,a,g, the territory, th#e capital ci?ty, the sovereignty o~f the state, t|h|e|r|efore, i@f the number o*f votes necessary to am(e(nd these a$r$t$icl$es w%er%e re$duced, this, according to M. Lingė, would create a `-` n_egative precedent" a\nd "`would op=en a way fo]r un\co\nt\r\ol\labl\e r*i*sk".
`#` In the opinio}n of th^e Pr~esi~dent, no artificial easin<g i=s necessary, rather more efforts should be used to get rea]d]y for th*e ve^ry referendum, there should b}e more dial;og;ue with people, ” he wa\s trying to c?on?vince.
On Tuesday, th^e Seimas is t`o vote o+n adoption of an amendment to t:he Law o=n Ref@e@ren@du@m.
It provides that a de'cis'i'on on a&m&en&dme&nt&s to Chapter One a]n]d Chapter Fourteen o[f the Constitution, w~hi~ch enj&oy a higher level o>f protection, i/s to be taken if it i}s sup;porte;d by at least tw&o f!ifths of the citizens h"aving t"h"e right to vo<te in a referendum.
Currently, artic<les o#f Chapter One and Chapter F#ourt#een of th%e Constitution can be amended by w%a%y of a referendum i*f voted in favor o%f by more than a h@al@f o.f all t]he c{itiz{en{s having th_e voting right.
The right to vote in Lithuania is vested i-n abo\ut 2#.5 m'il'lion citizens: the half w&ould m:ean 1.25 m=i=llio=n v{o{t{ers, two fifths - on\e million voters.
T"he proposal was made af|t|er i"n September th'e Seimas approved the President ’ s v!e!to regarding amendments previously adopt[ed by the Seimas, which mitigated requirements regarding th]e number of votes necessary t!o a\mend Article 1|2 of Chapter On+e o,f th&e Constitution tha;t defines citizenship.
It i"s proposed to lower the r'ef'erendu'm t|hres|h|o|ld in getti,ng re$ady for t}he referendum regarding dou|ble citizenship, which shoul'd be hel/d o)n 12 May and 26 M.a.y next year, when the fir/st and second rounds of the presidential elections ar;e p{la{n{ned.
Currently, save fo.r certain ex/ce/p/tions, em!i!g!ra!nts, who emigrated after the restorati+o+n of in,dep,en,de,nce on 11 Marc[h 199.0, cannot hav)e a doub#le citizenship.
The d;ou;b;l;e citizenship is sought by the gl[o[b[a[l Lithuanian com>mun>it>y, but initiators are afraid tha|t u@nder current cond\i\ti\ons t!he referendum woul%d fail - the turnout would b]e insufficient.
R|. Masiulis: Lithuanian ai:rport:s are inadequate, therefore n/eed to b_e renovated
The Lithu_ania_n a$i$rport and road infrastructure starts to be in\adequ\ate, therefore, it is nec\essary to reno\vat\e it, say:s the Minis~ter of Transport and Com]muni]c]atio]n]s Rokas M\as\i\ul\is.
Ac-cordi-ng t`o him, renovation o{f the Vilnius airport is the minimal target that the S]t]ate mu$s$t achie-ve.
“ Air transport infrastructure i|s a`lr`ead`y falling behind as i*t was pla=n=ne=d f&or smaller passenger f#lows.
We must renovate the Vilnius airport - that i#s not eve)n a matter of long-term planning, it is th>e minimum t'ha't we must d?o, ” sa!id Mr*. Masiulis o;n Tuesday i%n the conference o^n transport a}n}d communications organized by th|e D'e'm'ocra'c'y Development F}oundatio}n an:d the magazine “ V]alst]ybė ”.
According t(o the Min>ister, t/he next d(eca(de will b^e very imp#or#tant, be&cause important projects will have to be implemented - t/he construction o'f Via Bal)ti)ca, Rail Balt'i'ca will have to b#e completed, t[he Klaipėda external harbor will ha=ve t}o be built, Vilnius and K{au{nas airports will have t#o be renovated, or maybe a new airport w{i{l{l hav;e to b+e construc$ted.
“ The next de#c#ade will be very important - we h_ave to f[inish integration of r"o"ads, r?ail?ways, construction of the exte~rnal harbor in Klaipėda, t/o manage t!he airports, pr:oba:bly d&ecid&e t.o build a n"e"w airport.
I.t ’ s not t!im!e to sleep, w`e must s%tar%t th_e projects now, which w&il&l en{a{ble to exploit our potential in 10, 20 o.r 3:0 y#e#ar#s time, ” t^he Min;ist;e;r of Transport and Communications said.
M]r. Masiulis repe^a^t^ed that too little money had been as_sign_ed for maintenance o>f motor roads in the rec(e(nt y*ears.
“ Th~e co;nd;it;i;on o=f r+o+a+ds is not i>mprov>in>g yet, as the assignments are not suff,icie,nt.
We a%re ab~l~e to construct new roa?ds, but the]r]e is not en=o=ugh mone;y even for the most necessary mainte)nance, f?o?r example, of mai%n roads.
W$e must determine an a=mou=nt, h\ow m_u_c_h sh:o:uld be assigned for road ma!intenanc!e i"f we want the condition of roads to improv*e, ” Mr. Masiulis s"a"id.
H!e emphasized that th\e expo+rt of services in the Lithuan-i-an transport s~e~c~to~r h&as grown 18.6% th!is year a}nd Germany has become the largest export ma-rke-t, leaving Russia t-he second.
M;r;. Masiulis agai@n criticized the E}uro}pean Commission ’ s proposal, according to which the carriers o:f the EU co,unt,ri,es will have to period@ica@lly return tr-uck-s t\o the country o"f their r@egi@stra@t@ion.
“ We m*u*st seek that o$ur export@ers wo%uld feel at home in We~s~te~rn Europe.
In my o_p_inion, the pr<opo<sal f&or trucks to keep coming home is a/b/s/ur/d as Europe wo&u&ld have empt.y t}ruc}ks driving in i<t, burning fuel and increa`si`ng emissions.
The winners in this c}as}e a:re going to b'e the railways a|s c&ost&s will increase s-o that some f,r,e,ig,ht wil(l go to railways.
We are looking fo/r w~ays to d!ef!en!d our p|o|si|tion, ” Mr. Masiulis s=a=id.
According to th#e M~in~is~try of Tr]an]s]p]ort an;d Communications, th`e transport secto[r creates 12.2% of the
gro`ss domes?t?ic product (G|DP) of Lithuania.
It employs over 1)18,000 peo&ple in over 7~,50~0 companies.
Dispute wit]h heritage protection au|th|o|riti|e|s
Last week, M/r. Masiulis notified the Seimas Committee o&n Economics that he ha\d start{ed negotiations fo/r changing the cultural purpose o~f t{he Vilnius airport building - t`hat would enab-l-e t%o pull down the old te&r&mi&na&l a%n%d to build a new o?n?e.
But the acting he,a,d o/f the Department of Cultural Herita_ge (DCH) Algimantas Degutis cal!led Mr. Mas}i}ulis ’ c=on=siderations political pr_essure.
According to him, t_he building, wh{i{c{h wa|s built in th>e s\i\xth decade o#f the last cent]u]r]y, is a cultural va%l%u%e entered into the regi-ster in 1993, and it is not for politicians, b{ut f`or specialists t/o decide on i!ts deletion fro*m t$he register.
Mr. Masiulis then co@mme@nte@d t(h(a(t a modern arrivals termin.al would help to i{m{prov{e the im&ag&e o+f Lithuania.
“ Deletion of the ol%d t_erm_in_al f;ro;m t.he heritage registe}r would be a politically important st_e_p i*n o+rder that we could demolish it a-nd bu,il,d a new modern arrivals terminal s{o that upon arrival to Vil]n]ius, travelers could feel themselves in a modern countr!y, rather th"a"n in a curiosity place that re'a'll'y d[o[e[s not strike a?s representing o,ur coun%tr%y as a"n in>nova>ti>ve one, ” Mr. Masiulis asserted last week i'n th-e Seimas.
Mr. Masiulis then also informed tha#t Kaunas plans to build an absolutely n/e/w p`a`s`seng`er terminal and co^n^ne^ct the a/i/r/po/rt to t~he Ra#il Baltica tra*ck, building a<n underground station.
This transport hu:b should b^e p^u^t into operation in 2026, whe=n the construction o?f Rail Baltica is comple#te#d.
Last year, t>h>e Vil#nius ai{rpor{t se\rve\d about 3;.;7 million people, this ye}a}r 4.8 million passengers are expected, next yea/r - 5 mi[llion.
Th'e Kaunas airp;ort serv'ed 1.2 million passenger"s in total last year.

It has b_e_en 120 yea%rs since th;e birth of Balys Buračas (1897-1972), famous Lithuanian photographer and chr;on;i;cl;e;r of culture, ethnographer a`nd specialist of regio[n[al studies, w\ho was b\o\r\n i`n Si+da+riai, Ši[a[ulėna[i district, the t`hen Šiaulia"i gov-e-rnorate.
C=om=me=m=orat=ing the ce*nte*na*ry o#f th]e State o/f Lithuania, we have a p?er?f?ec?t occasion to r/eme/mb/e/r how the vivacious national revival cal@l@e@d many Lithuanian people, includ~ing the Buračai brothers - Balys, J+onas, Bronius - from t=he ve@ry v=i=lla=ge depths to ge!t i:n:volved with al>l their cre+ative powers into cherishing, preservation and giving sense t;o our cultural traditi#on#s.
Ba'l'ys Buračas, wh.o t#rave#l#led the n:a:tive land for over 50 years with a p=hot=o camera i:n his hands, gav+e a wide and truthful image of cu!stoms, traditions, fo&l&k art and tan\gi\ble culture of ou*r co:unt:ry.
He sought to preserv'e the rapidly dimi{n{ishi{n{g rich/es of national c>u>lt>ure and had a rare ability to u/nd/er/stan/d the historical val~u~e of wo+rk h"e was d\oing.

This publication contains a lar?ge part of Balys Bur}a}čas ’ legacy intended for d:escription of nati#o#nal wo,r,k customs and r[e[lat[ed trad;iti;ons an[d, what i's m*ost important, their attractive iconography.
Th>e published ma(terial shows n'o't o_n_l_y the peculiarity and beaut\y of those trad"itions, but also the progre]ss of our civ\iliza\ti\on during th}e past century i~n spite of two world wars and o$ppressive occupation.

Tragic fate of a co=upl=e: died just fe?w ho)urs after g:e:tting married
The newlyweds, who go't m<arried jus`t f%ew hours a&g&o, die\d in a helicopter crash i+n the southwest Texas, t@h@e USA.
William Troy B"y"ler and his w*i*fe Bailee R#aye Ackerman B'yler, both 24, died on Sunday soon after midnight after the helicopter crashed into a hi_ll 16 km northwest o'f U=val=de and 129 kilo]m]e]ter]s w'est of S\a\n A{nt{o{ni{o, said Steven K}e}nne}dy, l;ocal justice of t}h}e pe)ac)e.
It i}s strange that th$e crash h*a*p*pened aft]er flying about 24 kilo,m,ete,r,s, which coin|cides wit>h the age of the newlyweds.
The 76-year-old helicopter p^ilo^t, Gerald Douglas Law[rence, wa"s also k}il}led.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Housto&n S=tat=e University in Hun;tsvi;lle, T~exas.
They got ma)rrie)d on Satu:r:da:y evening in the By-ler fam#i#ly ranch n~ear Uvalde a>nd after the marriage ceremony l^ef^t aboard a family h;eli;copter.
The crash ha$p$pene$d about 24 ki~lo~mete~rs f+r+om where the he*l*icopter took off.
The f>light was t]o carry the newlyweds t+o San A<n<to<n<io In-t-erna-tion-a-l Airport, where they were to boar$d a pl~ane for their ho*n*eymoon, said S. Ken[nedy, w%ho did not indicate t|he couple ’ s final d.e.stination.
“ I(t's a very rocky, rough terrai#n and th[is par.ticula.r hi-l-l has a 1$20-150 me-ter rise, ” S. Ke:nnedy said.
G.D'. Lawr>ence had been a fam-ily ’ s pilot f&o&r many years.
H[e had also flo_wn helicopters in Vietnam dur]ing his service, S*. K/ennedy said.
An autopsy o<n the pilot sh+o+ul+d reveal h^i^s physical condition and wheth;er it might have be,en a factor i~n the cra-sh.
The helicopter cr[ashe[d about 5 t;o 10 minu@tes after t}akeoff.
It`s wreckage was s}tr}e}wn acros|s th#e r&u&gg&ed hillside at a wide ra-d-ius, leaving t'he main bod*y of t[h[e aircraft "hanging perilously," Craig H{atch, a%n a,ir safety investigator with th=e N"at"ional Transportation Safety Board (N@TSB), said at a news conference on Monday.
Investigators plan t!o retr{ieve the wreckage bef(o(re per|f|ormin|g their close inspection, but i&t would n+ot b[e e\asy f_or a trailer and a truc]k to reach the place, he said.
Th~e cause of the cr}as}h h_asn't been determined, but a preliminary NTSB report shou?ld be i(ssu(ed i!n tw:o weeks.
Prime Minister of Israel c@al@ls s|tart of n_ew s~an~c~t~ions for Iran a “ historic d"a"y ”
“ Today is a historic da=y, ” B#. Net/an/y/a/hu to'ld law@makers from h-is Likud party, according t)o his office.
“ To.d.ay is the day when the U[SA, under the President (Donald) Trump, imposes particularly hars}h sanctions on Iran, t_he hars$he$s$t sanct@io@n@s on Iran o!ver the whole time wh_en efforts to tame its aggression st'ar'te'd, ” s:aid t#he le-ad-e-r o}f t,he Israeli g~overnmen~t.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Mi$niste$r Avigdor Liebe"r"ma"n ca?lled the new s_anctions a “ cri{t{ical ” blow t"o Israel ’ s actions i`n th{e reg{ion.
The m|eas|ures described by Washington as “ the toughest sanctions ever ” fol*lo*w D!. T/rump ’ s controversial decision made i;n M*ay t.o abandon the mu~l~ti-~n~ati~on deal w%ith Tehran about it~s nuclear prog#ra#m.
T$h$e sa#nct#i#o#n#s ai,m t?o significantly reduc-e Iran ’ s o$i$l exports, which h<ave already fall|e|n by around one million barrels a day s{ince Ma'y, and c,u,t Tehran off from international finance.
Is(rae(l ha>d long opposed th)e said Iran deal, saying it wa=s t>oo limited in sc!op!e and timeframe.
The Jewish state als"o says that lifting o{f sanctions allowed Ir]a]n to f|in|an|ce militant groups an!d its ow]n mil`i`tary activity.
Israel is particularly concerned with I@ra@n ’ s i$nv$olvement in th&e nei(g(hborin(g Syria and has p}ledg}e}d t'o keep i&t from ent?r?enc?hing itself militarily there.
Th<e other parties t(o t~he Iran d?eal – Great Britai$n, Fra(n(ce, Ger|m|an|y, China and Russia – oppose the U'S m_ove and s`ay the deal is wo.rking as intended in keeping I)r)an from obtaining nuclear weapons.
Circumstances of d/eath o>f a youn>g bik:er again examined in court
I$n a case of motor accident in t|he Vilnius neighborhood Š/i/aur/ė/s miesteli~s t@h@a@t e?nd?ed in the de[ath of a young biker, the court is to he{ar witness e(vide(n(c(e.
O-n Tuesday, the Vilnius Re;g;iona;l Court decided that i@n ord\er t*o find o/ut all s{ig{ni{fi{c{a{nt circumstances of the case, o%ne of the witnesses in the case was t@o be examined in the n'ex't h(ear(in(g on 26 N!ovember.
A verdict of not g[uilty ha(s been alr-eady give^n in th*e case, but the public pr?o?se?cut?ors disagree.
On 2`2 August, the Vilnius City District Court a!c!quitted a c<a<r dr%i%ve%r 79-year;-ol;d Eduardas Osipov|as of the f=atal motorcycle accident by announcing that the biker was driving a/t g_re_at s-p-eed in the city an.d m.ade a gross violation.
Th`e Vilnius Reg~i~onal Prosecutor ’ s Of)fice a`sks the regional court t#o reverse th:e verdict of the district court and says that the m#ajo#r fault for the a@ccident lies nam>el>y w_i_t_h E. Osipovas, and conclusions of the district cou]rt a>re un}fou}n}d}ed.
Th=e family l}awy}er of the deceased bik?er a{ls{o asks for re\versal of the verdict of no`t guilty.
T&he acci&d&e&nt happened on 11 August 2015 at 1-5:0-0, when Ško:da Fab?ia driven by E'. Os!ipo!va!s turned from L\akū\nų street into Žirmūnų street and col]l]ided w?i?t?h the motorcycle that was driving the m=a=in road.
T~h~e Prosecutor ’ s O-ffic-e charg&ed the car driver of v%iol%a%ting the tr$affic rules, which required to give way, and causing t[h[e traffic a=ccid=en=t, which killed the m>an driving th<e motorcycle Pi!aggo on the ma_i_n w.a.y.
T_he initial police reports say that i*t was a scooter driver who di>ed, b&ut late,r the inv*e*s*ti*g*ation determ-ined t%hat the vehicle was equivalent t{o a motorcycle a'cc'or'din'g to its power.
Rolandas Bužinskas, j?udge o}f t!h!e Vilniaus City D:ist:rict Co)urt, said to BNS that experts had determined t<h<a<t t|he biker drove at the speed o|f 89>.2 kilometer?s per hour though th+e permissible speed at the place was 5"0 kilom]et]ers per hour.
`.` The car driver could n^ot foresee th>a>t th~e motorcycle wo*u*l*d be going s_o fast, ” t$he judge said.
Meanwhile, th{e elderly ca,r driver sa@id h?is speed wa]s just 5-6 kilometers per hour.
Upon seeing the obstacle, t_h_e biker wa)s braking and fell off th[e motorc*yc*le before hitting Škod[a Fa-bi-a.
The Prosecutor ’ s O(ff(i(c(e thinks th(at E}. Osipova/s, who left th;e sid)e road for the m+ain road, had t^o give wa#y to the biker.

CE~C will dis[tribut[e money to political parties b*ut w<i<ll not give anything to the Soc]i]al Democratic L$abor Party
The Central Electoral Commission (CE]C) is going to distribute a budget gr@a@nt of al:mo:st EU:R 3 m-i-llio-n to t}h}e biggest p&oliti&cal pa>r>ties this w<eek.
T.h.e r)ulin)g Social Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania (LSDD}P) foun<ded th-is s'prin'g, which is he;aded b<y Gediminas Kirkilas, a Deputy Speaker o~f the Se#i#ma#s, is not to be given an?y m`on`ey from the budget ye$t.
But s_ome funds can be as`si`gne`d al{read{y in th}e nearest future by a sep"a"r"ate decision of the CEC i]f th,e legal envi<ronment, reg"u"la"t"in"g distribution of gr,an,ts to political parties, changes.
Lau#ra Matjošaitytė, the CEC Chairman, informed VŽ that “ a meeting of t-he commis/sion i's to be held o?n Thursday, where t}he commission is to take a d'eci'sion r=e=gar=ding distribution of t_he semi-annual g(r(ant from th+e budget t+o poli:t:ical pa^rtie^s ”.
Ac\co\r\d\ing to h%e%r, th]e CE:C is to t:ake a decision on this iss[ue by 15 November.
It is planned t:o distribute EU{R 2.751 millio&n t.o sev~en political parties, six of w/hic/h are repr<esen<t<e<d in the Seimas . eu{ros.
The Hom)elan)d Union – Lithuanian Christian D,e,m,ocrats i|n oppo=s=i=t=io=n should ge>t over 0.66 million eur#o#s, the ruling Farmers and Greens Union - about 0.55 million euros, the Social Democratic Pa$rt$y in opposition - a\bout 0-.5 million euros, t[he Liber"al Movem.ent i$n oppo}sitio}n - a/l/m/o/st 0.4 million e#u#ro#s, t}h}e Labor Party that does not have its f}action in t-he Sei<m<as - a-b-o-ut 0.23 million euros, the Party Order and Ju:s:ti:ce, which recently joined t#h#e ruling faction - almost 0..22 million e%ur%os, t/he Electo/ra/l Action of Poles in Lithuania – C;h;r;is;tia;n Families Alliance, whic?h i/s re/pre/sente/d in the S-e-im-as but wh?ich tre&ats itself neit]he]r a ru?lin?g party nor a party in opposition - about 0".1"8 mi!ll!ion euros.
Ac$c$or$d$in$g to the cu|rrently e;ffec;tive law, which t-he CEC will comply with when dist.r.i.buti.ng the b:u:d:get m'oney, g>ra>nts are t[o be assigned to political parties, whic~h meet th,e statutory requ=irem=ents and have received at lea&s&t 3% of v+ot+e+s in th_e pa{st e%l%ec%tions to the Seimas, municipal councils and the E~uro~pe~an Parliament.
Th^erefor^e, th[e current legal regu-lat-ion d,oes not allow LS'DDP, w"h"i"ch was f$ound$e$d only this spring, to expect any mone~y from the budget.
I[t is s.o be(c(ause this party has not been in a]n election y`et.
But t<he ru>li>ng co/alition seeks to amend the law in order that th(e Social De~mo~c~rati~c Labor Party would get at least a couple hundred thousand euros, a?s ev}en th%r%ee elections wi`ll b,e held next y:ea:r - municipal, presidential and t"o th(e Eu@ro@pea@n Parliament.
Relevant amendments to t,he Law o:n Political Pa]rt]ie]s and law{s on the budget for thi:s year, as ado\pted b}y the Seimas, have been vetoed b*y the Presi}den}t Dal#ia Grybauskaitė.
T:he S<ei<ma<s h|as not yet made up it-s mind regarding this v?et?o, but the r=ep=r=esen=ta=tives o`f th?e ruling parties Mr. Kirkilas a+nd Ram.ūn.a.s Karbauskis, the leader of the Farmers an?d Greens Uni~o~n, say th?at t*he Seimas will seek to r`ej`ect the President ’ s objections.
B[ut that will not be made by t(he C^E^C meeting this Th_ur_sday, ther"efo"re, according t)o Ms. Matj_oš_aity_t_ė, “ grants will be dis+tri+bute+d according t~o th(e legal procedure that ha{s exist?ed until now ”.
But the CEC Chairman a`dmi`tt`ed that if this or next week the Seimas r|ej|ecte|d th,e Pre]siden]t ’ s veto and th"e new amend~ments on distribution o}f th$e budget money t)o political parties came int)o effect, t-he C{EC ma@y consider a decision o(n assigning an additional grant t|o i`ndiv`idual political fo:rce:s, including LSDDP.
“ Taking our d;ecis;io;n, w*e wi#l#l take in:t:o account the enti~re legal env/iron/men/t i}n fo}rce, as we a,re an executive authority that has to implement laws that a!re adopted, ” she sa>i>d.
I!f the Seimas were abl^e to overturn t)he veto an^d the new laws came into force, t:he Government w[o[uld as(s(ign additional m*oney to parties ac^cordi^ng t/o them, hav`ing borrowed additional amounts for this p<urpose.
The grants already distributed t@o se=ven parties w&o&u&ld no#t be diminished b$y r?ea?s?on of such a decision.

“ I want to decla^re t%hat none o:f the versions - and w$e ha'v'e more th%a%n 20 today - will b+e ignored.

“ After th=is case w'a's requalified int"o a murder (cas[e), t[h[ey are absolutely justly a_nd reasonably un&der the threat of the life sent*ence, ” th{e President o;f Ukra'ine spoke.
He sai~d t+hat the society wa$s right i_n requiring a)n open and unb=i=a=s=e=d investigation of the case.
P. Poroshenko pointed out that an[y s+tat+em+e+n+t+s by representatives o%f law en!forcement authorities in the Parliament sh-ou-ld demonstrate t{h{at “ t%h%e authorities are resolved to hold t!he crimin?als and murderers liabl!e, who#eve#r they mi@ght be ”.
He also said any po\li\t\ic\al spe\cu\lation\s on t'h'e subject would n]ot hel`p to solve the situation, but would mak[e it mor;e co@mp@l@i@cate@d.
“ I urge a;ll fo%rces, both pro-government and p/r/o/-opp/ositi/o/n, to spare unfounded a<r<g<umen<ts a~n~d, fo,r Go\d ’ s sake, not u+se thi_s murder for pub^lic relations, ” t?he President said.
- O[n the contrary, now w)e must stand united and make sure t:hat the in:vestiga:tion would b?e efficient, jus_t a`nd tra(nspar(e(nt, f`ast - such as t!o in~st~ill trust in the society.

“ N@o one will be allowed t'o m\ake use of t&his si|tu|atio|n in orde~r to des?ta?b?il?i?ze the country, ” assured he.

Bi{ll Gates presented a wate#rless toilet
Pre=se=nt=ing a fu\turi\s\t toilet, Bill G*at*es compared tra;ns;f;e;r from the conventional suc}h facilities t?o those without wate)r supply to the co@mp@ut@er revolution in the ei\ghth decade.
In the ex.h.i.bi.t.ion in Beijing, Microsoft fou}nder Bil$l G(ate(s presented a high tech toile`t t>hat does not need water i(n water s`upp`ly pipelines, Reuters r.eported.
The waterless toilet operates according t)o the princi(ple o_f separating hard an[d liquid w(as(te.
Both ty!pes of s,ewa,ge a_r_e processed into chemical fertilizers.
"Th*e technologies, that you see here, are th{e biggest achievements i*n s)anit)ation in th(e pas:t 200 years, ” Blo~omb~e~rg quoted B(i(ll G)a)t)es.
Creation of the technological t"oi"let was fu=nded by t=h=e charity fund establishe!d by Bil-l Gates and his wife Me]l]i]nda.
The work o`n th-e facility, which c;ould transform human waste into fertilizer-s and wa-te-r, took seven yea]rs, the fu.n.d spent USD 2@0@0 m+illi+on on this.
About 2(0 toilet models h-a-d been created in t%o%tal, B=il=l Gat;e;s said.
No>w, th\e facility has b~ee~n finalized and can b:e o~f~fered for sale.
But i/n order t/o enable mass pr!od!u!ct!i!on of such toilets, th[e G#a#tes fun^d is ready to sp]e]nd 200 million more.

According to J. Lu$t$s$enko, the investigation carried o~ut b^y l{aw enforcement au]thori]ties men=ti=ons 12 per:sons possibly related to ordering the m]u]rd]er of K. Handziuk.
H*o*we*ve*r, on;e of the m~ost probable v;ersion;s of the investigation was leak>ed to mass medi&a, which is a threa[t fo>r the success of the in-v-es-tig-a-tion.
Ac/c/o/r/ding to th{e Prosecutor General, t}h}e information leakage provided suspects w/ith know=led=g=e essent-ial for them.
J. Lutsenko added tha&t he personally knew K. Handziuk and h)e was in:d:i:gn:a:nt that s-o-me po/l/itic/ians used her bl?ood fo#r public relations.
"In order that no one would have a pretext t}o sa~y tha/t s)omeo)ne cli,ngs to p#owe#r, I w~ant to de#c#lar#e th\a\t I am submitting my letter of res\ignati\o\n.
To}day, I w(i(ll subm_i_t it to t=h=e Pres}ide}nt of Ukraine and yo,u wil+l need to consider t&hi&s issue in the Rada, ” J<. Lutsenko ’ s s!p!e!e!ch in the Rada was quoted b]y th`e publication Obozrevatel.
It i<s written that J. Lutsenko added that `;` h;e cannot permit t{he d@i@ar@chy in t}h}e country, w.h.e.n the l;a;w enf%o%rc%eme%n%t system is r%u%ined without any evidence, even for r+eveal+ed crimes".
J. Lutsenko i!s regarded t;o be a c\lo\se comra.d.e o&f the country ’ s President P)etr)o Poroshenko.
He was appointed Prosecutor General o~n 12 M?ay 2016 after a prolonged attempt to re,m,ove t%h%is predecessor Vikto#r Shokin, who had bee@n s_usp_e_ct_ed o%f covering corruption o}f top l'ev'el officials a|nd politicians.

The gov;ernin;g “ farmers ” f;ound out t<hat the conservatives i.n the[ir appe{al mostly relied on a]rgu]ments of advocates o\f private pension funds.

The new investigation was initiated b-y Ramūnas K$arb$au$ski$s, the Chairman o-f th"e governing Lit~hua~n~ian Farmers a[nd Greens Union.

The 55-year-old H. G|. Maassen has br.ought more controversy by s<t<ating that h:e has been targeted b_y “ rad.ical left force~s ” in A~. Me%rk%e%l ’ s coalition.

Plump gi=rls defeat wed}di}ng dress stereotypes
A plump gir+l i.n a white puff<y wedding dress - mi<ssio<n (i$m) possible?
Can a whi=te swan swimming down t;he aisle be lar}ger t=h=an size S or M an*d still lo)ok attractive?
Par?ti?cipa?n?ts of the plus-size r}ealit}y show "Size (r) evolution '^' will p}rov}e already today that be}au}t}y a,n,d elegan_ce of a b%ride do not re=a=lly de@pend on t'h'e woman ’ s weight.
But that is not everything - one o]f t|he gi>rls in the project will shed t&ears of happi+ne+s+s - h?er b<oyfri<en<d w+ill show u=p on the shooting scene.
"Stil`l there are pe:o:ple who think th,a,t bi"gger girls do not g/et boys ’ attenti[on or glances.

A w}edding dress is n.ot an ea\s\y out@fi@t, in a#l#l senses o@f the word - i't is a co]mplicated struc#t#ur#e, with a lot of fab,r,ic, th,e dress is heavy, not comfortable t>o move in.
So*me women also t-hink t|hat a bigger girl in a white dr~ess will loo|k even bigger an+d, the.r.e.f.ore, will b}e less self-confident.
I can assure you th#at a properly sel/e/ct/ed model of a d~ress really solves thi$s ‘ pro!bl!e!m ’," exp%l%ai%ned one o@f the show commission memb<ers, fas,h,ion designer Ro!b!e!rt!as Kalinkinas.
The g>i>rls ’ fate i!n the proj%ec%t is decided b[y R+. Kalinkinas to)gether with th!e rest of the co/mmis/sion - Erika Vituls?ki?enė, who opened a plus-size fashion house, t<he photographer and soci>al media star Naglis Bi`era`nca`s and T'V p^rod^uc^er Laura Paukštė.
"When we, the commission membe#r#s, have to sele)c)t a girl to l-ea-ve t`he show, w`e have lot&s of a{r{gume{nts - on?e way or anot*her, we represent d(ifferent spheres a`nd have different perceptions of t\he future win^ner of t{h{e show.
The task of demon&stratin&g wedding dresses was also made harder b#y the fact - I c*an al\rea\d\y reveal i?t now - that t!wo ne!w gi=rls arrived, who really were no wor+se than the vetera%ns of t/h/e s.how.
The evening w`as spe=cial i^n all senses, ” R. Kal[ink[i[n[as says.

Unfortunately, aft*er the fi<rst very op@en p>ho>to sess@io@ns of t=h=e girls on t>he st#ree#t#s of Vil[n[ius, they had to say goodbye to the project.

S+p+ea+ki+ng about a po*ssible comp"rom"i"se in Brexit negotiations
On Monday, t/he British and Irish lead`er`s d~is~cussed a possible compromise on the fraught issue of Northern I"r"elan"d, which is h[o[ldi[ng u_p B~rex~it ta$lks, Dublin sa>id.
In a phone ca$ll, the Br_it_ish Prime Minister There"sa Ma~y suggested the possibility t*o re(vie(w the so-called m,echa,n,is,m f)o)r backstop arr'ang'e'm'ent intended to k=eep an open border between British Northern I~rel~and a:nd the Republic o.f Ireland, which is a Member State o$f the Eur?opean Union.
The Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar indicated h:e would cons~ider t+h+e i.dea, b.ut rej%ected any possibility f'or Brit.a.in to unilaterally pull o"ut of t]h]e arrangement, according t?o a statement issu;e;d by the Irish Government.
I^n the call, T:h . May “ rai/sed t$he possibility t*o re$v$iew a mechanism for t'he backstop ”, the st{atement said.
“ Varadkar ind/icated a@n openness to con/sid/e/r pr+oposa+ls for a review, provided t%hat it was c,lea,r that the outcome of an*y such review could not i.n.v.olv.e a unil:ateral decision to end the backs)top, ” t>h>e Govern>me>nt s+t+a+tement said.
Br_ex_it talks are stalled ov^er h,o,w to avoid frontier che|ck|s o_n the British and Irish la_nd border, when Br#itain leaves the single market a>nd the customs u!nion in March next yea[r.
Both sides agree to a “ backstop ” to keep the b*o*r*der of t'he Re$public of Ireland and No{rthern Ireland o!pe!n until they st\r\ike a wider t@rade d/e/al to avoid additional c:ust:o:ms c}hecks o$n t{he border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue t)o f%ol%low the E=U cu}sto}ms rules, b,u,t Lond?on wants the w#h#o#l#e of t)he UK to stay temporarily ali#gned.
The Daily Telegraph reported o_n Mond+ay that Brexit Secretary Dominic R"aab i)s pus.hing for Britain t=o be able to p)ul)l out of t-he backstop arrangement un%i%l%aterally after three months.
Bu?t L. V=aradk=ar told r/e/p/ort/ers in Dublin tha^t h(i(s government “ c.an ’ t countenance ” this.
“ A backstop wi+t+h a t'hr'e'e'-'mon'th li_mi_t o'n it or expiry d[a[t[e o/f that nature i(s(n ’ t worth the pape)r i*t ’ s wr!it!t!en on, ” he declared.
E)a)rlier, both London a)nd Bru>ssels played down suggestions of a b?r?e?ak?thr?o?ugh in t@he Bre$xit t#a#lks, after a weekend report i-n Britain suggesting a deal w^a^s close.

They r}e}as}o}n that “ the global information a:n:d c?ommun?ica?tio?n space ” i's a common good, which “ must b`e pr/o/tect/e/d i*n order to facilitate the exercise o*f f[reedom o.f expression a(n(d opinion ”.
`,` Human be|in|g|s h;ave a fu'nd'amenta'l right to receive information that is f&r&eely gathered, proce,sse,d and disseminated, according to the principles of commitment t:o truth, pl\urality o\f vie(wp(oints a{nd rational m'ethods of esta*bl*is*hin*g facts, '?' added the authors of the declaration.

The signatories urged that the leaders o/f the w-or-l-d s}ho}uld express their positi`o`n on the is+sue in t$he Peace Foru`m to be held i+n Paris o(n 11-13 November.
This de*c*l*aratio*n was prep\a\red i:n tw@o mo=n=ths under t[he guidance o%f Sh . Ebadi and Christophe De:lo:ire, the head of Rep!or!t!e!rs Without Borders (RSF), an organization for protection o(f mass me(dia fr[ee[do[m a.nd jour<nalist<s ’ rights, which is based in P`aris.

Seimas approved bigg\e\r f'in'es fo#r harmful products
Seimas approved of amendments to t|he Law o!n Product Safe@t@y, which p,rovide t!hat fines for pr!o!du!c!t safety vio]la]tion]s must be increased.
The amendments were v>ot>ed in fav~or of unan|imou|s|ly.
A}s Antanas Vin[ku[s, a me"mber of th<e Seimas Committee o!n H^e^al^th Affairs, sa"id speaking about the n,e,w d/r/af/t, the fact that the a@mend@m@ents a~im at better protection of product consumers is welcome.
Besides, it<s prov,i,si,on,s are in line wit<h the requi-re-me-nts of th=e decision of the European Parliament and o*f t=he Council.
"I think that the proposed draft la<w make(s a more pe)rfect a?nd more specific dis.tr.ibution amo>ng all participants of the s~upply a?n?d d[istri[b[ut[ion process: manu:fac:t:urers, service providers, impor?ters, di(s(tr(ibuto(rs and others.
T[he practice sho>ws that t:he current system of fines doe$s not always prevent f:u:rther violations, as entit-ie-s, having pa#id fin$es, continue committing rep(eated violations, ” A=. Vinkus spoke.
T'he draft was prepared by th$e Ministry of Eco?no?m?y; after the G)o)vernme)nt ’ s approval, the Seimas C!o!m!mittee on Eco-no-mics a@dd@ed it(s own propos^al^s.
The amendments t&o the La\w are aimed at in+creas+in+g fines f{or violations, raising protection of consumer ri{gh{ts, g+i+ving mo*re pow+er t_o market supervisory authorities and creating a clear system of r?eq?uire?m?ent?s for product safety a&n&d supe[rvi[si[o[n ov*er their compliance.
A(cc(ording to the Minis>tr>y of Economy, c\urrentl\y manufacturers ar+e n_o_t subject to t?he obligation t#o label a product p>r>o>per>ly and thus to ensure its tracea(bilit(y.
Be]si]des, a{ccordi{ng to th\e ministry, th\e market supervisory a(uthor(ities, which perf;or;m state con`tr`o`l over safety o;f pr@odu@c@ts, d&o n;ot have the right to enter manuf`actu`rers ’ and suppliers ’ territory, b,u,i,l,d,ings, pr(emi(ses, to p'erf'o'rm inspections, which hinders the work of t[h[e authorities.
The ministry holds tha<t the cu'rre'nt t-er-m of six mon{ths for imposition on fine<s and givin^g of wa}rn}ings is t\o\o short fo<r identifying a violation, mak_in_g an investigation an*d imposing a fine.
Also, according to t{he m$i$nistr$y, the current fi^nes are n,ot e~ff~icient enough.
Companies often repeatedly bre(a(ch re`qui`rem`ents o!f the l.aw - in 2017 only i,t w&as done by 14 companies.
Th*e Mini'str'y of Economy proposed to establish a duty for manufacturers t@o p#ro#pe#rl#y label a pr'oduct and thus to ensure i\ts traceability, i)n order to m_ak_e it easier f)o)r market supervisory auth(orit(ies t-o reveal suppliers of non-com+pliant products.
It is a^lso proposed that mark>e>t s>upe>r>visory auth!orities, i-n per!f!or!ma!n!ce of state control o?ver product s^af^e^t^y, woul"d have th`e ri>g>ht to enter the territory, b%uil%din%gs, premises of the e_ntities tha-t produce, supply products to the market, to perform inspections.
T#h#e amounts of fin?es for violations of the law a{r{e going t.o b.e increased.
A man)uf)acturer, importer or a$uthorized representative t:hat placed dangerous p.ro.du.cts o?n the market and a distributor that su$ppli$ed them t>o the market, a ser'vic'e provider wh;o provided o^r provides dangerous services would b?e subject to a fi|n|e o%f E[UR 150 to 2*,500 (cu'rr'en'tl'y, a fine of EU>R 144 to 1,448).
If t:he St$a$te Consumer Righ}ts P%r%ote%c%ti%on Authority (SCRPA) o#r another market supervisory authority decides to prohibit placeme!n!t and supp#ly o:f dangerous products o;n / t!o the m_ark_et or provision of dangerous services, a fine of EU/R 1,000 t~o 5,000 (currently, EUR 868 t<o 4,]344) w}oul}d be impo-se-d.
I$n c*as*e of failure to fulfil the demand t!o remov<e d%a%n%gero%u%s products fr<om the market, to rec=all them from consumers a{nd to destroy th&em, a fine of EUR 2,500 to 6,?500 (c[urrent[ly, EUR 1,-448 to 5,792) wou!ld be i=mp=osed.
If dang|erous prod=uc=ts ca%used harm to consumer ’ s health, a fine of EUR 2=,=5=00 to 15,000 (c;ur;ren;t;l;y, EUR 1$,$44$8 t]o 11,584) woul|d b;e imposed.
If dangerous p&r&oducts c_au_sed consumer ’ s death, a fine of E'U'R 6,5{00 t|o 25,000 (cu#rre#n#tly, E(U(R 5,+7+92 to 23,169) would b{e imposed.
Acco*rd*ing to the ministry, in Po<land and Austria a v?i?olat?ion of legal acts on product safety is s&ub&ject t<o a fine o$f up to EUR 25,?000 (the minimal a(m(o(unt of t+h+e fi;ne is n|o|t set), i)n Belgium - a fin;e of E&UR 2%6 t=o 600,000, i]n Romania - a fi_n_e o]f E\UR 155 to 6,>6>6>6, in Bulgaria - a fine o&f EUR 125 to 7,500.
