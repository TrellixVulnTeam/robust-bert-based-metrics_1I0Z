We ne[ed t^o understand that rec&o&g&nition by those Tasmagambetov, Aitimova, Sultanov i$n fact that they are colonizers' slaves, open exp;r;essi;on o$f their en/dless love towards Russia is a[n o#pen re]co]gnition of the depe;nd;e;nc;e of t(o(d(ay's followers of yesterday r{e{d butchers first o}f all to Ru-ssia wh+ich we th|ou|ght to be vanished into thin air u/p to d]at]e.

W}e have t?h?e center of the di'strict fo}r}med with To!rgay name, coming from l}ong since.
I?f i:n 3-0-s, 40s th|e name of Kostanay ci't'y was Torgay, the`n the works on re]t]ur]n]ing the previous n~ame would be reasonable.
Bu.t I a-m ag)ains)t i/t, it is my viewpoint - Arkhimed Mukhambetov concl&ude&d.
