The president o*f DF=B Grindel s?ees no basis f@or the returning of Özil
Berl\in - Th)e preside]n]t o'f DFB Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for the returning o=f M!esut Ö~zil to the national team.
There is a;n ope?n question so y/o/u get in?t?o a conversation, you talk to him about why yo\u have apparently f.elt t%h%a%t way, how is stated in his s<ta<temen<t, said Grinde+l i;n football Podcast `=` Phrasenmäher" o<f t[he newspaper `-` Bild-Zeitung '+'.
In sp>ite of th)e debate going on for months ab,o,u,t the ph-ot-o-s of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Er)do)gan, he reg]rets the ret~u~rn of th<e 92-match nation"al pla,y,er Özil.
I would b~e happy if Mesut Özi`l con@tinu@ed to p'lay for Germany.
A&t som|e p?oint of time I also assu)m)ed th)a)t it will happen, said Grindel.
The 29{-yea{r-ol{d ha)d d_e_cl_ar_ed that he quits DFB team in July a&nd explained it with th)e fact th]at Gri(ndel did no,t p<rotect him against racist hostility during t@he World Cup.
The DFB h}ead repeated his c\ritic\i\sm of Öz<il and that h|e is no^t ready for a dis=c=us=sio=n with nationa(l co)a)ch and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
H\e did not wa+n+t to c]r]eate any pressure, but he kn*ows tha`t i,n football ‘ i^f you leave a tea{m or change cl}ub, y<ou talk t=o your trainer and I think it i>s sad that thi;s di,scus,sio,n did not happen before ’.
Li'nz: Garden shed in al_lotment gardens bu;rnt down
At 14.13 t_he Linz professional f/ir/e department was notified o+f a f\ire i>n Angererhofweg.
A,s a high-voltage power line directly traverses th,e a<ll<otment gard,en, d*a*ng*e*r was imminent.

T*he roof ha=d t\o be almost completely removed a#nd the huge a+mou+n+t o?f debris needed clearing.
Th|e ow#ner of the bu=rn=ing garden hut sta[ted that at noo|n h$e had connected a battery t.o the power supply for charging.
This w'as the p"os"sible cause of t~he fire.
According to the fir%e department the loading unit w<a<s in the most intensive a.r.ea o"f t`he fi+re.
T}he damage caused by the fir\e, an|d th>e caus>e of the fire, still needs t]o be investigated.
Th=e d^ama^ge could be c)on)siderable a?s th\e owner stored many collectibles in his garden hut.
Ang&r&y mo_t_her defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refugee family on t]he s>tree>t
W\hat provoked Lindsay Lohan to such very str/ange a|c|tions?
She appar[ently wanted to lur;e the chi=l=dren away from t<h<e alleged refugee famil^y.
Lindsay Lohan (3@2, ‘ Herbie: Fully Loaded ’) ha%s live streamed how s|h|e ope-n-ly wanted t/o tea*r children away f@r@om a fami{ly i(n Moscow.
This was rep?or?te?d b[y US p'ortal "TMZ '-' with publication o#f a p@artial recording of the stream.
Here yo&u can see the "J-ust My Luck ']' w_ith Lindsay Lohan
In th#e clip you can s_ee how Lohan gets o_ut of a c#ar and goe_s up to a possibly homeless fa@mi@l@y, identified as a refugee f@amily f/r/o/m S,yria.
As the family flee in front of the act\ress, Loh?an fol|low|s t]h]e pare)nt)s a+nd their children.
She accus,es t]he adult@s of child trafficking.
Y`et sh"e does not offer any pro&o&f in the cl}ip.
The whol|e world is watching, says Loh#an in the v|ide|o a}s she f"ollo"w"s the family further dow+n the st\reet.
S\he s\ee\ms t,o try to separate the chi"ld"re"n from their parents.
At some poin?t, however, i;t seems that th,e obviously angry mothe*r ha<d it en]ough.
It look!s a=s i^f they t!urn around and Lohan gets a sl[ap in the face.
I.n tears, the act!r!ess protests about h*ow shocked she is - holding he/r ch|eek.
What provoked Lindsay Loh:an t@o such very s]tra]n]ge actions is currently comp%letely un]c]le]ar.

A)udi: `'` Dieselgate" regeneration take-s longer than planned
There i+s still a diesel ta<skfor<ce, s>a>id P>ete>r M&e&r&t&ens, chief development officer fr)om the ‘ Automobilwoche ’ trade jou=rn=al.
In Dece#mb#er 201+7 t*h*e imprisoned a_nd suspended Au\di CEO Rup^e^rt Stadler h+ad announced, the taskforce will be dissolved soon.
In the fi~rst quarter o\f 2018 all engine/transmission combinations will have bee#n checke\d, he said at th~e tim}e.
Mertens n?ow s:ays: ‘ At the start of Ju"l"y w{e have a'n important milestone by which t]he diesel crisis wi-ll have been worked o@u@t.
We have c$omple$ted the internal te&chni&cal a(n(a(ly(se(s of o=u=r VTDI engines.
Th?e taskforce was set u)p in September 2015 foll[owing t$he d^isc^overy at Aud]i parent company Volkswagen.
M~ert~en~s highlighted that t;he au+tomob+ile m%an%ufactu%rers had made ‘ serious, organizational changes ’, t}o pr=event su/ch a scandal ever happ~en~ing again.
T?he VW S@up@ervis@o@ry Board had postponed a d~ecisi~on on S;t;ad;le;r's f[utur[e on Friday and will continue thi+s di/scussi/on on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse t~he Aud-i boss, f.ollowing aw[areness of exhaust emission c&heat&i&ng, of p"erm"i"tt"i"ng the sale of diesel automob+ile+s w%ith false em%is%sion values.
H;e must have kno+wn about t-he tampering or deliberately ignored i)t.
Currently the Sa,les Director Bram Schot h.eads th'e company as Ac}t}ing C>h>ief Executive Officer.
Aft]e]r conversion t:o th?e new emissi^ons and consumption stan(d(ar(d W"L"TP, t)her)e were production losses at Audi, Schot told the ‘ Heilbronner Stim[m[e ’.
Essentially, he sees a fa}lling d<em<an<d for limousines su>ch as th#e Audi model%s A6, A7 an"d A&8, pr"oduced in Neckarsulm.
The segment i%n its\elf is a difficult one, h$e sa,id.

Gr<i<n<del seeking re-election - Lahm to j(oin t-h-e Presidential Board of the German f_o_ot_ball as/soc/i/a/t/ion (DF#B)
Mainz (d;pa) - Despite the criticism directed at h;im perso,nally following the early FI}FA W@orl@d Cup exit an*d the scandal arou*nd Mesut Özil, Reinhard Grindel wants to r;un f+o+r office a-s President o\f t\h\e DFB aga%in i>n the coming year.
I do my work and t~ry to make i-t a,s good as i.t gets, s>aid Gr-inde-l as a guest early Sunday m-or-n-i-ng on Z_DF ’ s we+ekly sports broadcast "Das aktuelle Sports`t`u`d`i`o ';'.
A re-e)lect)io)n sh(o(uld be attemp!ted and that is w&h&at I will do.
And then you have to see w[hat k{i{nd o-f support you ge:t.
I%n his own w,ord,s, the head o*f the association would find it `]` strange '!' if he did n|o|t `&` feel like working o"n th]e future project" a*fter Germany was awarded the UEFA European Football Ch,amp,ions,hip 202\4.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been the hea:d of t&he a?s?sociat?io?n a<s successor to Wolfgang N>iersb>ach, who had to resig.n amidst the scandals sur~rounding t;he 2006 FIFA World C[up i@n G,e,rmany.
In autumn 2016 he was elected for a first f)ul)l te&rm o<f thre~e year|s.
The n`ext vot+e will be h>eld at the D}FB ’ s national conf;e;ren;ce on Se?pte?mb?e?r 27, 2019.
Accord\ing to G~r~indel, the future head orga-ni-zer of the 2024 European Football C>hamp>ionship i\n Ge*rmany, Philipp Lah#m, is t?o join the DFB P,resi,dential Board.
I would be plea.s.e.d i$f my colleagues on t$h$e presidential board agreed t,ha,t he will continue to p]r]o]vid]e advi[ce o%n the board i<n th=is role and then of co"urse we very much invite him t^o share his e-x-p-eri-e-nce in sport&ing matters, said Gri_nde_l.
At th;e s}ame t|ime, he did not w.ant to speculate as t:o w'het'her or n;ot Lahm could succeed him as head of th-e DFB.
As a c+o+nse+quenc+e of the s]ca]ndal o;v;er the photos take&n by Mesu't Özil and I*l*ka*y Gündogan with the Turk]i]sh President Recep Ta!y!yi!p Erdogan, Grindel expres:sed a prefe\re\nce for a na+ti+on+a+l team player w/i/t/hout a(n immigration background t?o fill the position of DFB amb]assad]or for integration.
Currently, th#i#s positio>n i=s fi|l|le|d by native Brazilian Cacau and Celia Sasic, who trac^e^s he%r family back t.o Cameroon.
If somebody without a migration background i>s an o\bviou\s influencer i<n society and football a\nd says, ‘ the i%ssu%e i,s an i?m?p?o?rtant on.e, w.e n)ee)d t_o do something about it ’, ‘ this woul:d also b=e an in:i:t:iat:ive to provid?e a better fo=undation for o|ur local teams, where integration needs t}o work ’, G'ri'ndel said.

Ma>ny of them are ac`cuse`d of alleged espionage o'r s;u;p;po;rt;i;ng or be'ing members of prohibited parties o_r the F!e!thull!ah Gülen movement.
The Turkish government holds the movement responsible for t+h+e failed attem;p;te;d c?oup o$n Jul(y 1`5, 2016.
Som%e of the accused j-o-ur-nalists are faci*ng s-ever-a-l decades in jail.
Even fo)reign journalists are no.t safe from Turkish authorities: A^t the beginni>ng of September, the Austri+an journa"l"ist Max Zirng-as-t was ar!r!e!s!t!ed.
Most recently, the cases o]f the i<ncarcer<a<ted journalists Me^ş^al^e Tolu an(d Den/iz Y<üce<l caused a stir.

Acc:e:s:sin:g th_e 36]-]kilom]et]er cycle track in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is v*ery dif=fi=cult and heavily littered.
Attempts ar^e m^ade to re;me;dy the rampant vandalism, b\ut there ar'e hardly any signs o>f solutions.
Sh-a-r-d-s, cigarette butts, garbage a}nd rubbish, demolished r%u%b%bi%sh bi\n\s and no%w d`is`mantled signs - so f_o_r qu>it>e some time pre)s)ent)s itself t]h]e entrance with seating area to the bike p}at}h on t*he Haaße-hill in Treysa.
The s@igh@t o`f the bicycle path, which i+s the fla?g?s?h?ip object in Rotkäpchenland, i;s more than ingloriou(s.
T(he matter is of concern t:o the AD=F=C (German Cyclists Association) chapter Schwal$m$stad$t, but ot<hers ha=ve also taken interest f!or som;e time, according t'o the city '?s cycling com*missio*ner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The pr&ob&lem has a|lr|e|ady been addressed b?y the b$ic$ycle traffic advisory body.
T$her$e i|s n/o solution so far.
Suggestions rang;ed from transferring th:e seating area to the regular em)p)tyi)ng o~f garb_a_ge cans, an-d cleaning the point of e(nt(ry areas.
I t/h/ink, th\e lat{ter wo.ul.d be the o@rde@r of the day, i&rr&espec&tive of any further activities, sa\y\s Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (AD=FC) sa-ys h\e also brough]t the is,s,ue up with the local advisory c>ou>n>cil.
Not o}n}ly the rubbish is a nuisance for c!ycl!ists and residents - o-n weekends t'he seating g)roup is a re?gu?lar mee"tin"g place for part?yin?g.
It is not ju&st ab\o\ut the n{oise, there are a%l%so disturbances d'u'e t&o parties: Posts p.ull.e.d o)ut of the ground, ga#rb#a#ge cans wrecked, sig'ns snapped and seating daubed.
Frequently volunteers ha$ve already cleaned u\p, explains the A,D,FC member Susa/nn/e Klipp)ert.
Actions are o]nly p?r?overbial drops in the o]c]e]an.
Th]ey are anno~yed that th-e re`s`t area a?t the c_ycle track in Treysa is a meeting point for binge-drinking.
Clearly t^h^e focus p~o~int along th;e entire bik:e path i/s he<re on the Haaße, co;n;firm;s the cycling commissioner, who now i>s also respo%nsible for the cycling site in Ziegenhain, whic<h w,ill be opened to^d^ay.
If i=t suffer!s t=he sam@e fate, it will cost dearly.
Another idea is pl#a#cing v)id)e)o surveillance on t)he h]ill: "P&oss&ibl&y this raises the threshold to engage in damaging c/o/mmon p'ro'pe'rt'y.
Ho-wever, this w$o$uld require a p;oli;ce pat<r<ol to come out.
In principle, Wü#sten#hag#en supports t?h?e deve]lopmen]t of the Haaße hi:ll.
I)t ne<eds to b|e made more attractive.
So f;ar one can be v}ery satisfied with how well t"he bicycl=e path i~s frequented.
It i~s sti.ll possible to develop tou`rism-`related marketing.
Our c!y!cle track is o@f very high quality compared t+o others in German ’, agre~ed the A/DFC m+em+bers.
ADF\C member Susanne Klippert cons}ide}rs the situation in th#e A[scheröder Strasse in Tr?e?y?sa to be critically d|a|nge|rous.
T@her@e i{s no turning l|ane on Haaße Hügel.
In h@e@av@y traffic, cyclists m;ay end up wa#iting in the middle of bi&d&irect&i&o&nal tr_affi_c flo%ws '$', she explains.
That w[o[ul[d not be a prob%l%em for sporty cyclists, b|ut i^s for older people and e=specially f[o[r children.
Mu*sic contest a|t the culture train stat*io*n: The `}` Kö von Hiltrup" a'nd the s@ea
T@h@e first call to participate i{n th]e music cont[est wa&s a success, creative an*d cooperative.
Yo!u!r So+ng f{or H~i~l~t~rup is the motto of the Hilt|rup initi[ativ[e for the "Music Contest for young an,d old, ne=w a.nd experienced musicians."
A contest `_` with a w;ink from the l$o$vel$y Hiltr<u<p family", as K(arl Fra=n=k=e worded it.
In fact, it soon became a fa$m$i$lial togetherness with c+offee and c"ake from the voluntee~rs o/f the K(ultu(rbah(nhof.
Seven acts pe#rf#orm#ed, from a o_n_e-man ba?nd t@o the big ensemble: Alvin J&a&s&ic with pianist Marcel Untied, Henk Humberg with his gui}tar, Rolf Ih"mig, an old=-esta=bl=i=sh=ed Hi*ltru*p man, th;e "Hiltruper Sternfa.rb.e.n", thr:e:e members from thr^e^e generations of th%e Trenkamp a(n(d Clau[s families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lu}mmerla}nd and finally Rike Weßling un]d d&ie Zwa=rtie=s.
This contest is a n~ov~elty, ex"pl"ain"s distri_ct mayo;r Joachim Schmidt.
We ha|ve not s"e"en something like this i#n o{t{h{e{r districts.
What d,id t)he songwriters sing abou)t?
Particularly popular pl}ac}e}s were the Hiltrup lake an@d Ma*rktalle*e.
Rol\f Ihmig dedic[ated the so}ng to the avenue Ma"rkta"lle in his f)o)lk-l)i)ke song "Kö von Hiltrup '`'.
Th)e Kulturbahnhof was als@o mentioned.
Over a=nd over again, the ac-ts sang about exp!er!ie!n!cing tog~ethe~r~nes~s in these places, e/spec/i/ally Alvin Jas|ic.
Karl F]ranke l&e&d the audience through t*he breaks with short interviews wi|th t^he per=fo=r=mers or so.me information about the artists.
Thus, t|he audience learnt that Humberg th]a]t he ha|d actually studied che/m/i/st/ry, but now also t+ea+ches g$uit$ar.
From t%he sound engineer Stefan S!chemmel!m!a!n!n Franke reported t[h[at he ha/d re)cen)tly performed in L"udwi"g"sh"afe"n - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Ha[rv[est a?s a mai-n act.
And Al:vin Jasic h_as uploaded a lo:t of YouTube vid,eos.
It ’ s not ab"o"ut win|ning, F$ra$nke ha&d said.
In fact, a$l$l participants re_c_eived a g+ift from Hiltrup cat=e=ri=ng businesses.
Fo.r the jury's favorites the`re w[a[s s`ometh`i`ng special - so that oth>er>s coul_d also hear their songs.
Alvin Ja[s[ic and his pianis^t Marcel Untied can record a#n entire CD wi/t/h soun,d technician Sch>emmel>mann.
Ot^her musicia]n]s c"an record a song: Ihmig w+i+th his Hiltrup hi't, w#h#ich especially impressed Fran}ke wi,t,h h`i`s m<usi<c<a<lit<y, and the “ L%ummerland pack: ” “ a v@ery good p*erforman*ce ” with te'n children a-nd two tea"ch"e"r"s on guitar and cajón, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, the children al_so performed a'ga'in fo*r the fina#l#s - an(d even without electronic support, they s,oun,de,d `{` really good, '?' Franke s^a^id.
The jury was g@ui@ded by th#e aspects of originality, reference to Hil`trup, catch_i_ness of th~e mel{o{dy and re=cogni=ti=on value.
The jury included Gisbert Ke&ller f]rom the We^s^tpha^l^i^a^n Sc(h(oo(l o~f Music, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers f{rom the T}rade Association as well a|s Jan Kaven, cha(i(rma(n of the dis$trict offensi#ve.
The district offensive launched th"e event o-n th<e oc?casion of i*ts ten-year anniversary.
T_hey c&onside&red the event a complete s-u-cc-ess.
Everyone was "very satisfied, '(' and `:` the atm]o]s]p]h]e]re w/as good" i"n t`he very crowded Kulturbahnhof.
The W$or$d Game: Test=i=n=g `(` Decrypto"
T+he players form tw_o teams and sit oppos=it=e one a)nothe)r.
For ea\c\h page there is a scree`n, o#n it there are four c,a,rd,s wit,h keyw~o~rd~s that you can decipher - the old trick w^i^th t~he red f:oil.
Thi+s ensures th=e oth}er side cannot read anything u*n*inte*ntion*a*l*ly.
Fo>r example, on the ca$rd$s it says t'o read f;ro;m left t'o right: "1 . Rena_is_san_ce.
2 . Fe+ns+t+er.
3 . Cub*e.
4 . S"oli"dʺ.
These a*re the te^rms that need t?o be coded.
S$o the t>erms a#re not guessed, th#e codes are.
Taking turns, one pla@y@er per t_e_am i~s the en>cry>pt>or.
Th"e"y get a co:de card that h+a+s "3~.~4~.2 . ']' e(tc . written on it.
I<n "D}ecrypto, '\' it i(s not t_he words behind the secret film t_hat sh>ou>ld be guessed, but their encryption c+ode+s.
The task in this case: T%h%ey should - i?n thi?s order a]nd in this example - describe th@e terms "cub~e", "`so!l!id '~' and `-` window" - in such a way that h:i:s o\wn team recognizes the correct o}rd}e}r and the opposing team does not, because the tea#m that crack:s t'he cod+e twi&ce w|i|ns the game.
The encrypt/or wri,tes down and reads aloud: "Throw" for the di{ce, "loose" as opposed to "solid '[' . O.f cours:e, something l!ike `/` evi'd'ence" would be possible or `(` Prague" b<e<c<ause h]e r'ead some his%tory boo{ks and knows ab/ou/t the defenest}rati}on of Prague.
This the{n progresses, r+o+und f#or round, t?eam by team.
It i+s tru,e t)ha)t on[e does n%ot kno^w the terms o:f the other side - bu#t w@i@t@h every clue the encryptor gi/v/es, you ’ re closer to finding them out.
S=o t[h[e term shou_ld be a@s mysterious as possible, b)u)t not too craz{y . Otherwise, you make it unnecessarily difficult for y>our te<am.
The mos!t cryptic ‘ Decr%y%pto ’ is the p,recept u?nf?o?r?tunately.
The players have to st%u%dy it for quit}e a long time a<nd i{n de@tail, until they can fina(lly pla`y it.
The explanatory video under decrypto.info o{n the w~e~b will m~ake it e&asier.
But o-n-ce you have started, y#ou ’ ll be amazed a;t how m@uc@h em<ot<io<n t_he_re i/s in this nondescript game.
Ov\er\all, however, "D;ec;rypto" is not q^u^ite as conclusive a}s it#s p*redecessor and genre-primus "Codenam$es '_', whic,h a{l{s{o makes use of t^he spy them!e for a g?a?me wi!th few words, but it ’ s much ea_sie_r to play in small groups.
A\nd if it's all a^bout guessing and n_ot about w{inning, it's ea\sy to p"la"y a version f&or two.
K(ul(m(ba(ch: Man gives po;lice the Hit`l`e`r sa'lu'te and harasses guests in the p'ub
During t\he ni`g`ht from S~aturd~ay to Sunday a 4`8 year old man ga\v\e t*h*e police station in Kulmbach twice something to d<o.
First he showed th%e Hitler sa$lut$e to a passing police p&a&t&rol in t?he upper t&o&w&n, later h#e wa`s also found in the upper to?wn i/n a pub where h>e h?a?r?ass?ed other guests.
After clearly under the influence of alcohol he did not comply wit^h the po$lic$e order t(o vacate t,he pr:emi:s:es, he h[ad t}o spen@d t\he night in the dete+n+tio+n cell i<n the p}olice station of Kulmbach.
In the sober state, he also had to t>ak>e legal r=esponsibility fo}r the us!e of symbol:s o-f un*cons*t*ituti*onal organisations.

F"or decades the depot in P,re,ssig w?as the hub of the F/ran/con/ian Fo)rest.

The crashing f!r!o!m bum!per to bumper could be h;e;ard th^ro^ugho^ut Pressig, remembers Ge=org Din~kel, who archives the h;i;s;tory of the p>l>ace and the s*ta*tio*ns.
Th#i#s did n~ot bother anybody.
The squeaking of br'a'k'es and rattling of ca\rri\ag\es could al,so b^e heard.
This w$as pure ra{i{lwa{y.

No"wh"er"e in the F:ranconia:n forest ha?s a place been c}ha}rac}ter}i}zed by the railway s+o much.
This was t)he starting poi:nt fo*r the steep mountain secti`on t/o the north, which peaks in Steinbach am Wald fo:l:lo:w:ing an a(scension of a;bou;t 2<20 meters.
Previously trains and locom}otives housed in Pre.s.s.ig were needed t&o handle t|hi|s.
I=n 1>9>01 th:e Bavarian parliament approved the b`ui`ld`i`ng of a de|pot with 21 locomotives, apprentice workshops, cat*en*ary and railr#oad maintenance d<iv<i<sio<n.
T^h^e centerpiece was the turntable, w}hi}ch af\t\e\r r"eco"n"s"t"ructi"o"n in t,he ye\a\r 1'899 had a diameter o'f 18 metres, says Norbert He[idrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railroader with 4)7 years o]f e*xperience.
Th>e Pressig depot, which i+n th.e year 19.68 wa,s re>lo>ca>t>e>d to Bamberg, a;ls;o operated locomotives f:or th%e branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stoc|kheim - Sonneberg and Kr.onach - N\o\rd\h\alben.
O(n Jul$y 15 1950 the `{` Volksblatt" reported o<f a staff of 160 men; 13 steam loco$m$o$ti$ve$s and eig-h-t electric locomotives were s+t+atio+ne+d i-n P%ressi%g at that tim'e.
The electrification of t}he track in 19[3[9 reduced the n`eed fo$r pulling tr@a@ins and locomotives.
From 1977 they were st*i*ll us$ed wi%th freight trains.
B`y 1991 at l:ea:st 10-,0-0-0 wagons were shunted.
I-n 1982 th-e d>ep>o>t was par>t>iall>y dismantled and the remainder in t#h#e year 1991.
H]e]id]rich: ‘ It ’ s a sha_me th,at bett[er us#e o<f the location i^s not envisaged, also with regard t+o freight traffic ’.
Still i-n the year 1989 a\t Pentecost, the Nuremberg R/ail/way Directorate celebrated "5&0 years of electrification Nur}ember}g - Saalfeld '\' with a pompous s=t=at=ion festival fo'r the a)nn)iver)sary in P"re"ssig.

Beijing (dpa) - Wi&m&ble&don winner Angelique Ke`rber a*n*d L_aura Siegemund have reached t^he second r^o^un^d in th)e tennis tournament i}n Beijing, just as J,ulia Görges before.

On t]he we+e+k+end as part of the `}` Ar!t and Enjoyment" ser)i)e)s, a special exhibition was opene=d i;n Mittelehrenbach.

This o[pen[ed its doo{rs for the 15th y&ear.
Th/e la>r>ge number of visitors showed th>e fascination with t=he exhibits.

I/t was possible to persuad(e Max Marcus Stadler from Nurem,b,erg t.o provide mu&sical framing.
The vis"it"or quickly understands w$hen walking through the spac[ious garden that th]e title "Windspiel-Performance" literally challenges the arti~sti~c imagination an)d ultimately expresses i!t i\n a playful w_ay.

5=0 years of M$G$V 6-8 Albachten: Sin}ge}r}s celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - T-hat was the time o|f the pr~o~t~es~t an)d th<e student movement.
And also the peo/ple of Alb/ac/ht/en demonstrated th\e\i\r anger.
A`t least fiv#e of them.
In no c,as,e did they want to accept that aft}er t`he dissolution of the church choir "`Cäcilia" there wou<l<d b-e n%o more singing lif!e in the di;st;ric;t.
I!t has become a legend by now: A-t a ba*n*k in Tinnenbusch, t_he MGV 68 c?a?m?e t/o exis`tenc`e.
That was 50 y#ears a#go.
Now there will b,e a big a=nniversa=ry celebration i_n t*h*e “ House of E|nc|oun|t|e|r . ”
It will b<e full to~da~y, s+ens+es chairman Jürgen Holst/ieg/e, an}d he was right.
T|h|er|e are 1>5>0 guests, a real succ'e's's for t&he Albachten singer.
They had re(v(ived t\h\e foundation festival especially f>or th$e anniversary.
It was a tr,adition for years, an{d then the)r)e wa<s a brea*k for the fi?r?s?t time.
Th>e traditional festival was back again in time fo^r t`h`e 50th an)niver)s)a)ry.
It became an ele=gant ball and forma?l clothing h@a@d been r,equested beforehand.
Guests did not s\it i@n r\ow\s as usual i@n the “ House of En&c&ounter, ” but rather sat co@m@forta@bl@y a!round tables.
I}n between, every+o+n+e could da#nc#e . DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln put o|n th]e c=o=n=t=r=o=ls and heated up t{he dance floor.
Of co|u|rs|e, the singers of th\e MGV 68 Albachten would let the_ir voice.s so|und.
Matching t;he occasion, h\app\y songs were quite f\it\ting.
Almost set: `"` So ein Ta$g, s(o wunderschön wie h(eu(te . '\'
There wa`s also the “ Rüd}e}she}i}m win_e ” to go with the exquisite grape juice, which m!an!y guests h]ad i=n f=ron=t of th&e&m.
“ Hum%u%lu%s lu-p-ulus, ” which i~s t`h`e Latin name f(o(r ‘ hops, ’ references another cool d[rink.
T;h;e ch=oi=r di{rection o=f Ri}chard H;oman;n, who is one of the five who were in Tinne|nbusc|h back then, w[as once again very confident.
It's just fun to sing un@de@r hi*s d~i~r~ec~t~ion, said Holstiege . "He ha)s suc~h a*n easy way, he accomplishes a m[a[s[ter[pie[ce every time.". B^y the way, t?his time not o-nly me{n we"r"e prese-nted vocally.
T%he ladi@es ’ ch+o+i+r “ Hig-h C ” w&ere als:o guests, whose repertoire a\bove all includes evergreens from the 20s to the 6;0;s.
To round i.t all off the"re was some po$etry.
Singer Theo We>b>er sat at h=is desk until three in t:he m%or%ni%ng t|o create his ow,n rhymes.
An^d Andreas Wi-nter-ho-ff also presented melodic poe,tr,y.
There wa=s also a b:ig Tombola g_ame.
The pr/oceeds are to g}o towards financing the children o[f the Albatros Y~o~u~t~h Cent;e;r visiting the all-w"eat"he"r zoo.

Abo$ut h>er marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller did not feel sh%e was enoug^h f{or her h:u:sba:nd
T]he "Dr$ea$m Ship ':' made H)eide Keller a star.
Now she speaks openly th*at the series c`oul`d have had som+e infl#uen#ce on her divorce with Han`s von Bo{rso{dy.
Heide Keller (7\6) beca/me famous in h@er r=ole as chief ho+stess Beatrice vo(n Ledebur on th&e ‘ Dream Boat ’, bu~t o`n 0<1 January 2018 she disembarked forever.
T<he series that made her a star m;ight be o^ne of the r{e{as{o{ns of he(r failed marriage t+o Hans von Borsody (1929 - 20_1_3), t=o wh(om she had been marri|e|d for t#en yea,rs.
T#hi#s c~ould also h(ave been a reason.
Because thi%s work became a p'art of me, I traveled around t*h*e wo%r%ld with a suitc]a]s]e alone a>n>d ma&ny o~f my admired c)ol)l)eague)s treat@e@d m"e a{s equal, explained Keller in the interview to `%` Bild am Sonntag".
She u\s\ed to be "th^e wife o~f Hans von Borsody", but that ha`d c~hanged with th/e "Dr(eam S?hip".
Because now jou&rn&ali&sts called her on$l$y a>s Heide Keller.
I don ’ t know i]f h\e was h/app/y w,i,th this.
Sh/e thi~n~ks that it possible that her husband might have bee@n jealous at t,he t[i[me, but "a>s many men Hans was a!fra!i!d o!f talking ab'ou't problems and feelings . '%'
Keller always made e~ffort for Hans von Borsody `[` a*nd he d\id n?ot wan_t to discover m:y fears and my weaknesses.
In plain language i#t mea]ns: I ’ m pretending, '|' as sh/e ex|plains fu^rthe^r.
She always ha{d the feeli$ng o.f ‘ not be%i%ng enough for him.
He saw in me a[n em(an(c(ipat(ed wo=ma=n, whic[h ac%tua%lly I neve,r w.as, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and courageous o<n stage.
I wa#n#te#d ou+r love to last fo[re[v[er ’.
Afte,r a previously failed marriage to Thomas Hä@rtn@er, K=eller s}a}i}d ‘ Yes ’ again, ‘ a+lt+h+ou+g+h I w_as s^c^ar^e^d it co(u(ld go wrong ag,ain ’.
Th)e d"ay before th&e civil marriage, I sat in the changing ro`o`m crying a)nd wanted to cancel eve[ry[thing.
Th$e marriage to v|o|n Borsody failed a"s well.
W/hy d,i,d it ne=ve=r work out with men?
Because I wante`d to$o much.

Football: District League: Strong appearance of VfL Wolb~eck against th^e S*C Alt{enr{hei{n{e give.s hope
There w[e[re mo|ment|s in t}his young s~e~ason, when Alois F-ets-c-h was really hard on his t+eam.
Si\len\tly, t;he coach of th<e football di>stri>ct league club Vf|L Wolbeck first retreated (inwa-r-d-l-y) to ponder over th:e lack o@f motivation on the pla>y>in>g field.
All i`s hist{ory.
Meanwh|i|l|e, t&he game is on at Bra"ndhovew"eg.
The 1:1 on Sunday agai.nst SC Al:tenrheine p}ro}v}e}d so, a&nd t)hey almost got promoted p#as#t season.
Yes, I am v%er%y happ~y with the a-p-pear-a-nc-e.
We made tightened s^pac^es and pu~t pr%es%sure on th!e ball.
That wa#s something to be proud o%f, praised Fetsc~h his boys and went to each of his players i!ndiv!i!du!a!l!l!y after th~e game to simply say "t}hank you '%' fo%r t)he great defense against t>he amb[i[tious gue-st-s.
The coa@c@h had to ch`ang`e the syste~m after 2+6 minutes.
F[ollowing Nico Frer{i{ch's injury (muscular problems) - f~or hi@m came Luca Re.h.berg - t_h_e 4-$4-2 almost seamlessly changed into a 4-2-3-1 i\n which Ni<k<la<s T+hewes was in th,e front line waiting for passe=s to him.
Wo$lbeck had much more t=ime of possession in t&he first h{alf.
And more o^ppo^rtu^ni^ties
But Fr@e@r@ichs (1)7), substitute Luca R=e=hberg (26m) and J*an Schroer (38t^h) missed t+h+e l(ea(d.
It alm/os/t backfired whe+n S/C/A ’ s very own Kevin V^o^l^lrath and C>hri>s Naberbäumer mad%e t@w@o dangerous attacks a|gainst Wolbecker i/n minute 4;1, but goalie Damian Hal_la_s pro|v|e|d to be a master of his trade.
After halftime, Vf'L boldly took comp|l|et|e co%ntr%ol.
Thew*es just barely fa.i.le.d w+i+th a s-ho-t from 18 meters.
Schroer was to&o late i<n minute 5!8 w?hen Thewes passed him t{h{e ball.
Fetsch dec$ide$d to fres%he%n u$p t<he t"ea"m on the le;ft wing and put in Miles Geske.
As Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer c*u*t d<o<w<n Robi@n We/sthu/e/s i)n minu~t~e 7!0, the home team got an indirect fr!e!e kick 1_8 meters away from the goal.
The fouled player him.self st>ep>ped u,p and d!emon!s!tr!a!t!ed how dangerous he ca(n be in set pl~a~y situations.
Westhues kicked t^he ball with his stron>g right an$d t{he goalie had to face the fac@t that h|e h<ad fai\led: 1:0 (minute 7&1).
With 20 minutes left on t^h^e clock, th#e game s-ee-med to las$t f\o\rev\e\r.
Because th;en this happen*ed: In minute 80, V#fL captain Florian Quabeck accident{al{l{y touched th/e b-all in the b/ox.
Referee H?üsey?in Sah&in (Hamm) immediately p"o"i"n"ted to the po+int.
Ja.nnis S.ch.nei.d.er was not ready to mi^ss t[h[is opportunity (minute 7}9).
Wolbeck h>a>d t{o e/ndu/r/e l\o\ng minutes i-n th=e final st_a_g_e, when Geske finally managed to finally get that ball in~to the goal and secure the winning g;o;a;l i]n minute 87.

Werdohl - The square in front o_f t:he Friedenskirche in Eveking b?e?lon?ge?d t^o th~e motorcyclists on Sun]day.
Af`t`er all, th/e c]o]n]c]lud]ing service fo_r t?he bikers was to be held here.
Fr:a:nk Schröder is the motor pastor i:n t'h'e Evangelical church of Wes^tphal^ia and is therefore respo(n(sib(l(e for th"e pasto_ra_l interests of th(e high-HP cyclists.
Between April and September o-n th/e last Sunday of the mo'n't'h, the traditional motorcycle s%erv%ice (Mo_Go) t^akes p\la\ce at Nordhelle h~ou~se.
The b+ik+e+r+s traditionally c:ele:b:rate th(e end o&f the season in the Friedenskirche in Eve}ki}ng.
T_here, so`m`e 15+0 bikers ga`t`he`r`ed on Sunday for a church service th!at wa@s anything but ordinary.
Starting fr$o$m 10 am, the hea~vy bikes lined up i,n f~ron~t of the entrance portal o#f th@e church.
T!he bi+ker brunch was the first agenda item and attendees had a chance t*o t$u$c$k i?n?to some coffee a~nd cake o~r eve=n a hearty Currywurst.
In addition t!o the MoGo team, t|he Ho`ly Riders, a Christian m@o@t@orcycle group from G+u+mmer+sbac+h, were a|l|so i&n attendance.
Priest D/i/rk G=rze=g=orek gave a s[ermo[n during the b*i*ker church service.
Sing}er-songwriter Vale#rie Lill accompanied the service with her mu+s+i+c.
Although t%he bikers prefer t)h)e Blues-Rock, V#alerie Lill struck rather ca_l_m and p;oe;t;i;c notes, said p<asto<r Fran]k Schröder.

Füchtorf '`s Ho"me Association celebrates a ma:j:or festival: The m<ilk comes a$f$ter the apple
And Borisch was al@so active on th)e a+ct+ual d}ay of action.
S+he provided h*e*r hungry gu%ests with freshly made app^l^e pancakes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg a"lso aroused a bi\g amount of in=t=ere=s=t.
He h#ad his a_pple press in his lu'gg'age and demonstrated th!e life o~f an apple to his astonished spectators step by st!ep from t"he ripe apple t&o app?le juice.
Ev{e{r{y now and then, Hartmann-Niemerg h_ad hel#p from th|e children to fill the appl/e/s in the bi|g funnel.
W[ith a little muscle power, the apples b>ec>ame a fi~nel~y cho-ppe-d ma:ss.
N+ot many of the c?h?il?d?ren could imagine h-ow a tasty drink w|as to b'e made from i@t.
Bu~t they c,o,ul,d ev(en witness this important s`t`ep on the la[te Friday afternoon.
Packed i=n mo&l&ds and wrapped in nets, Ge)or)g Hartmann-Niemerg stacked t(he apple pi=e=ce=s layer by layer, which looked a bit li#ke c%hoppe%d shr?e?ds.
Thanks to certain technical suppo+rt, th-e last work step wa&s n:o:w no lon[ger so diff,i,c,ul,t.
T+he freshly pressed j^u^i^ce gradually r-an into a b"ig vessel.
But the Fü+chto+rf farmer als]o ha}d b*ot*tl*e*d specialties with him.
So h&e o;p;ened his “ treasure chest ” and presen/ted t|he l(atest Federweisser [al?coho?lic beverage] t[o the older visitors.
There was a l.ot o`f demand for the g%ood “ Made in Füchto#rf ” b)eve)r)ag)e.
In a comf+orta+bl+e at_mos_phere, the p|a|r|ents got to talking wh`i`le the children w[er[e not only ab[le to fol@lo@w the p|rocess of pressing apples, bu_t also di-scove-r-ed the bouncy castle th/at had been s<et up.
Active m=embers of th+e Füchtorf com`r`adeshi`p of former soldiers were al`s`o involved in th=e festival a&n&d inv<ite<d pe[op[le to join in fu$n games at several stations.
The H@o@me Association will also of[fer an action day nex,t ye>ar.
T?he?n, however, emphasized Gregor Kr"ütz"ka"mp, the c'om'm'un'ity cent>er i"n the h&eart o\f the asparagus village will not b$e the site of the acti@on.

1:4 aga~i~nst Fr_ankfur_t: H$anno$ver facing fourt+h washout this season: "S}hitty situation"
F:rank:furt / Ma^in After their fou'rth Bu~nd~e~s~liga defeat i#n a r^o^w, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed players fr!o!m H^an^n^over 9,6 and gave them courage.
However, t$h$ere w%ere not many positiv_es to take awa:y from the bottom te<a<m ’ s earlier 1#:4 (0%:%2) result at Ei_nt_rac_ht Frankfurt.
It i~s a crappy situation, but you h)ave to co=me out o?n the other s[id[e a*s a team, said 96 player Pirmin S>ch>w>e>g>le>r, addin~g: `|` T>his is of co%urse d+isa+p+po+int+ing, because you a(lw(ays try for the best re*sul*t possible".
Victory co&nt&inue&s t+o elude t/he players from Lower S>a>x>ony, for wh=om only Florent Muslija (86 .) scored to narrow the gap . They remain a<t the bottom of th@e table wi\t\h only t=wo point.s and mu>st b,e con"s"id"ere"d a relegation candidate in their cur~ren~t fo*rm.
By contrast, a{n ex}cell}en}t Ante Rebic le&d Frankfurt to celebrate their fi[rst home w,i,n of the sea@son.
Evan Obite Ndicka i_n the 3(6th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jon'athan de G'uz'má'n (59th) and Lu:ka Jovic (89th) scored for t/he DF$B Cup wi!nners in fr`ont of 46,300 spectators . After t`he successful dress r$e$hears$a$l for the Europa League matc-h against L<a<z<io, Frankf~ur~t m-ove i(nto t>he middle o[f th/e table on s_ev_en points.
Croatia ’ s Vi#ce World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every d{a{nger{ous o#f#fen#sive mov@e by the Hessians a't his st>ar>t>ing elev;e;n debu,t w,hi,le Hannover ’ s defense struggled t'o reign him i?n.
The striker battered after the World Cup, showed b>y hi{s tem?po and assertiveness w*hy he i)s so valuable fo}r E@i@nt@r@ach@t.
Besides Rebic, t+he B>razi>l>ia>n Allan, on l/o/a/n from L:i:verpo:ol FC, was called up to Frankfurt ’ s s]tarting e+lev+en for t}he fi@rst t(i(me a$n$d the team got o-ff to a dynamic start.
The first s_i_gn of danger ca|m|e i}n th\e form o*f Lucas Tor~ró ’ s hea-de-r (17th), which was deflected into the n#e#tti#ng.
Six mi|nu|t|es la%t%e%r, Sébastien Haller wa*s st}oppe}d by 9&6 ’ s defense in a promising p'os'iti'o'n . The defenders w"e"r"e l]ed by t<he Brazilian Felipe, in for Kev$i$n Wimmer, w`h`o suffered a last-minute b{ack injury.
The h+om+e side ’ s lead wa/s a%l%l b:ut inevitable an=d completely justified.
After a defended corn*er k+ick, Filip Kostic lifted t+he ball into t~he box and Haller headed i&t i:n front o[f t~he goal, wh-er-e Ndicka only had t]o tap it in.
It wa]s the first B:undesl:ig:a goal fo@r the defender f]r]o]m Fr-enc-h second division team AJ Aux`erre who had joined the club during t'he su,mmer.
An`d Frankfurt increased the tally bef{ore the bre}ak.
This time, Ha<ller passed to his fellow st~r~iker Rebic, w<ho skillfu>l>ly dribbled thr@ough the lines l%ea%vin%g 96 goalkeeper Mich#ae#l Esser no cha>nc>e.
At half-time Hann>ov>e>r Coach Br&ei&t&enre&iter rea$cted to the weak performance of his eleven a`nd brought i<n Bobby Wood an/d Hendr!ik Weydandt, t!wo new attackers.
The Lo`wer S}axo}ny side showed more courage going forw_ard but could no@t come up with a$ny d,azzling i%d%eas until just before the e\n\d o]f the match when they a"t least managed t%o sco>re and narrow the gap.
T{h{e Hessians wer)e much more e%f%fi%c%ient.
After ju=st under an hour Rebic s(tarte(d a solo and the?n crossed to D#e Guzmán, who just tapped t'he ball in%to the empt|y goa_l.
P-lay-ing a&g&ains&t overstretched g_uests, F)rankfurt could take i]t easy for the rest of the matc'h, w|hi|ch al|so saw Jovic scoring wi[th one minute to go.

Geisingen: Ch=ristia=ns in Geisingen celebrate the Hol~y C_r_o_ss festival
Catholics in Geisingen c/el/ebra/t/e the Holy C@ross festi~val on September 14 or o^n the Su]nda]y af-ter.
The f)es)tival service takes place at the t\o\w\n church, followed by a procession to the C~hu~rch o{f t%h%e Ho)ly Cross wi>th the bl[ess[ing.
At the Ch<urch o~f the Holy Cros#s lie$s Christus, w:h:o witn@e@s@s@ed t,he Thirty Years' War and is said to have been shot by a S|w|edi|s|h so'ldi'er.
Blood flowed f$ro$m t|he gunshot wo&un&d.
Th"is res!ulted in a great pilgrimage to th\e Christus' resting place, which t*h*en led to th*e c=onstruc=tion o_f th`e Church of the Hol]y Cross.
The construction is no't finished yet, only t_he s-anctuary i]s, the missing nave is indic"at"ed b"y th.e trees.
In h&i&s homily, Fa]t]h]er A<d<olf Buhl reminds u.s t`h`at the cross i-s a s^ign of hope, comfort and life.
Inspite of th-e im$p$or$t$a$n$ce for t~he G+eis+i+ng parish, attendance wa\s rather poor.
A:ft:er the service, the procession to t)he Church o)f the Holy C"ro"s"s took place and t}he fin^al b'lessi'n'g concluded th,e ecclesiastical part of the cross festi)v)al.
The Catholic church choir has been inviting people to t/he se"cu"l"ar part o%f t^he festival in t@he Catholic p+arish home for m!any ye)a)rs.
T)h)e choir members prov(ided visitors w]ith hearty food and a b@i@g select!ion of c.a.k.es a&nd, appropriate for the wea}t}h}er, farm-fresh ice cream.
In the afternoon, the pari}sh of[fe[re[d guide_d tours around the city church, B!ern!d Be:n:d:schn:e:ider and Petra Sc#h#m#i#d-Seg#er informed t$he visi|t|ors on b"e"ha"lf o'f the pa+r+ish abo}ut the damage t|o the facade, roof, th[e sandstone works and win,do,w,s and the upc)oming construction, which will last until next year.
After the scaffold h}as been stand*ing for some time, t?he damage c$ould be more accurately determined and t>he individual calls f]or bi)ds c.ou.ld be prep^ar^e more concretely.
It i:s c]ertain that t'he renovation is mo{r{e expensive than planned, because the alre`ady ex&isting damage hase wo^r^sen^ded over th@e la~st few years, but a=lso more damaged has been u#n#covered, whic%h w<a<s only possible through the inspection by mea|ns of the scaffold.
The plinth plastering work i`s c'omple'ted a=nd b!e!fore the winter, th.e natural sto`ne work will begin and t$he involved pa)rti)es hope to finish a}bout half of this work t.his year.
O&p&ening cere[mo[ny: New residential home i&n Neu-Ulm ’ s Mün]s]te]r]bli]c]ks]tr]aße
T#he Donau-Iller li,f,e aid i"s opening a new h?os?t?el for people with disabilities in M>ün>ster>blic>kstraß>e.
All thos[e attending th@e ceremony agreed that `*` a v_ery special house" is now openin+g its doors for i&ts in!te!nded purpose.
After a/ll, t-he tw*el*v*e wheelchair users who h;av;e be%en li*ving in t?h?e residential home provided by Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller fo#r some time, de;pen;d on its unique architecture.
Wider aisles, ha+ll+wa+ys and doors, larger r<oo<ms a;nd ba$rri$er-fr$ee access f=o=r a.ll areas have all been part o(f architect Rudolf B*ader ’ s c%once%p%t.
Planning first began a#bou#t ei=ght years a$go, wh|en t$h$e f~ormer US Army offi\c\ers ’ building was tested f]o]r its suitabil}i}ty for residents wi|th disab:ilitie:s: `~` The house w%as getting old and no longer up-to-date in terms of features, '<' Bader explained looking b&ack.
In 2016, exc~avato~rs st?a?r?ted ro"lling to demolish the ho|us|e.
The new b~uil~ding was to be de~sig~n~e~d to b@e a!s we@lcoming and brigh`t as possi'b'le, so that the residents could feel comfortable i[n it, says t!h!e architect.
L\ebe\n\s\hi\lfe Donau-Iller opens ne-w residential home
The lif]e a,i,d invested approximately 4.6 million euro in th@e new c$onst$ruction.
T)he state of Bavaria contributed 2%.4 million Eu{ros, the d\istric\t of Swabia 450,000 E=uros.
According to a!rc!hite!ct Bader, t)he construction wo\rk has remained within the planned framework - both i,n te{rms o=f ti;m;e and financially.
The Lebenshilfe ’ s managin_g d@irecto@r J&ür&gen Heinz tha-nked Bader this accomplishment.
The balance between a barrier-free an#d fi%rep%roof design h%as not always bee!n e{a{s{y.
Nevertheless, th|e planners and handymen bui;l;t a h#ome with many specifications, t&o allow residents t'h'e freedom t#o move e[ven without o[utside help.
The sa&me was expressed by th<e h*ea*d of s:ocia:l services i<n t_he Schwaben district, G'er'tru'd Kreutmayer: ‘ The home i!s geared towards t;he special requirements of its re>si>dent>s, who need help w-ith mo(bi(lity ’.
Comfort and functionality hav}e be/en c)om)bi)ned to good effe)ct in the pr[o[c[ess, said Kreutmayer.
And also: ‘ The pro(per(ty in thi\s loc{at{ion i-s a real str`oke o&f luck, be&cause it no longer need"s t'o be acq)ui)red in today ’ s situation ’.
A-ll in all, the new resid=ential h_om_e on Münsterblickstrasse houses 3^0 pe.op.l.e w-i-t-h disabilities on almost 1,500 square meters, divi\d\ed in<to three resid.enti.al groups.

Back to regulatory work - t,his is t+he unofficial m&ott&o f]or the working we_e_k of the g.rand coalition s&tarti&ng today.
Hardly an interview, hardl;y a speech in which th+e Ch{anc{el{lor and her ministers fr'o'm the CD_U, SP@D an+d also lastly from the CSU did not invoke t"h"e mant$r$a `,` return t!o work".

After the substitution, bo~th teams decided t,o do s&om&e&th&ing again#st the growing bore^dom.
In m>inut>e 4%8, Sebastian Mützel s.h.ot just over the g+oa+l from 18 meter]s and after one ho(ur the G|üte|rsloh pl+ay+er also appeared offens:ive for the very first time.

I!n addition, they w#ent one better wit}h a header f<ro<m Wiecko"wicz (minute 6_6) a!ft!e!r a corner from former Ahlen p)layer Tim Manstein.

Graffiti w:ith a local pol"i"tica"l me:ssage: Unsuccessful advertising for a skate p=ark
In Lengerich, unkn)own p;e;opl;e ha[ve advocated fo:r the construction o^f a skat,e park in a hardly beneficial way.
In several places, there ar?e gra!ffiti, says Jürgen Kohne o,f the city admin/istr/ation o%n the request o;f the W>N.
I%n at least o>ne case, a c'r'i'min'al complaint fo;r proper&ty damage ha+s been filed with the police.
The th{ree words `:` S)ka)t)epark for Lengerich!" are d/i/splay/ed i~n large letters on signs, among others at th!e Gempt-Halle and th;e Ol=d To*w*n Hall.
Michael Rottmann, mana`ger of the hall, reports t]hat w[riti[ng w[as fo/und on the advertising sign on the stairc*ase to the Gempt Bistro o.n Sept?ember 1"9 after the caree{r choice fair.
S$ince the short me&ssage wa/s a+pp+ar+e+nt+ly "only" made with a marker, it coul<d easily b!e removed.
A fe,w days l~ate~r, it wa)s there again, bu_t this time i>t wa/s sprayed on, s)ays Rottmann.
He assumes t%hat t|he r}espect}i}ve ad.v.erti.s.ing sign has to be replaced.
This case i"s special by the fact that sever@al large co|mpa|nies from Lengerich ar;e men't'i'on'e'd on the bo/a/r/d.
If the sk{ate park i&s bui^lt, its realization will also be made p:os:sib:le b?y spo?nso?r?s.
There are already pledges, explains Jörg H`es`se`l`m`a`nn from t]he u_r_ban department of school:s, sports a>n>d cu>ltur>e, w&ith&o&u&t naming names.
I\t i"s possible, however, that one or m`ore of the spon&s&o&r&s ar*e identical t;o those companies tha.t are on the g+raf+fit+i+ed board.
Fo_r years, local politi,cs and a"d"ministratio"n have bee`n dealin`g with the topic of a skate p*ar*k.
Afte&r the old ha,d been dismantled at th#e LW!L clinic, the search f,or an alternative locati#on began.
The council fin+all+y c<hose the fire department parking l(ot.
H'o'w'ever, this r#equest was not im+p+lemen+ted - apparently, too m}any factors we,re against a constr{uction a't this point.
A#t t;h;e end of June, it was all tu.rn.ed ar]ou]nd again.
Me"mbers of t@he main and fi"n"an"ci"al committee now voted unanimously for th{e area o^f t'he Gutenberg school.
Regardi}n}g the state of affairs, Jürgen Kohne s@ays that th]e administration i~s currentl{y i&n the middle of conc~r~e~te planning.
Then, city counc>i>l has the la;s;t wor#d.
He assumes a de@c@i@sion will be reached this y%ear, so th}at pa~rk can b+e built in 20+1+9.
Bottlenecks i|n air tr'a'ff'ic co<ntro<l are getting even worse
Fra=nk=furt / Hamburg After th}e chaos af?f?ec?t?ing European air traffic i/n the summer, German air traffic controllers see no s`ig`ns o&f im`prov`ement in t,h,e com|in|g year.
This y%e%ar it wa\s only wind, 2@019 w>e will h[a[v[e strong wind a!nd the storm will hit a|fter t-ha-t, h*ea*d of the German air traffic un#i#o#n, Ma&t&t&hia&s Maas, told the German Press Agency ah+ead o?f the aviation summit on O\c\t\ob\e\r 5 i\n Hamburg.
H~e sa$id that the well k,no,w,n staff shortages plaguing European a$i$r t;r;affic controllers a?r?e an important re/ason for the nume)ro)us delays and flight cancellations an/d that there is no quick fix to t&hi&s prob)lem.
Airlines a^nd airports can mak{e q[ui[ck improvements for the co,m,ing ye(ar, but t@r@aini@ng new ai<r traff}ic c<on<troll<e<rs takes four to five years, the unionist said.
He ad(ded t+ha+t t{he{re are hardly any fully trained a(ir traffic controllers a{vai{lable o.n the European market.
H%e pointed out that the Karlsruhe ce?n?ter monitoring Ger_many ’ s upper ai:r space alone is short of so@me one hu$ndre$d st@aff.
Maas again c,ritic,i,ze,d t@he fact that d'iff'e'r'ent air transport trade un|ions were not invited t<o the sum$mit.
Representatives from federal and st;ate governments, air traffic controllers, the airlines, an$d th(e airp>or>ts gather on Friday to tackl$e th_e causes o{f t.he de?l?a?ys.
If you wan(t to talk abou,t a)d)ditional w?ork an\d overtime, that will not work wit\ho\u\t us, said the head of t!he German air t`raf`f`i`c union, many me.m.ber.s of w/hich w.or.k fo'r the fede)ra)lly owned German air traff&i&c control company DFS.
Maas again h(eld th:e E@U Commission ’ s guidelines responsible for the ai+r t<raf<f<ic c*ontr*o*l predicament.
He asserted th^a^t traffi@c forecasts for t_he regulatory period u/p to 2019 had been far to[o l$ow.
Th'e resulting cost t^ar^gets a.n.d personnel savings at the national air traffic con,tr,o,l services no[w hav+e a severe impact on daily operati:o:ns, h"e stressed.
M?aas appealed to Federal Tra&ns&port Minis$t$er An%d%re%a%s S[c[he[uer (CS%U), t+o promote r;egulatio;ns in Brussels that would not "keep on depriving air traffic controllers o+f oxygen '\'.
He cautioned t{hat, a/s things stand, the EU targets would be c:o:o:rdi:nate:d b+y 202_4 a(nd further tightening i_s to be exp[e[c[ted.
A=c=cor=din=g to Maas, the EU i.s exposed to constant lobbyi=ng pressure fr@om th=e airlines.
Ryanair boss, M:ic:hael O'Leary and hi<s col"lea"g"ue"s ha@v@e no[w reaped exactly what th'e'y have sown in recent y;e;ars, said Maas.
He hopes that th$e high costs i/nc/urred b,y the airlines as a result of delays w)ill le<a<d them t&o think ag=ain.
The G%er%man ai]r traffic union would work t[o i[m[p[ro[ve the situation only if the D^F^S we<re to offer a `?` coherent agreement for future-oriented training an+d educa)tion," said Ma/as.
H|e further noted that the previously anno`u`nced in>ta>ke of 12/0 air traffic control s't'ude'nt's per ye<a<r ov^e^r the next f'i'v'e years is just enough to compensate f/or age-rel_a_t_e_d personnel reductions.
I\t does no(t ye(t address the necessary staff expansion.
Thy[ssen[kr[upp supervisory board v`ote`s for group restr*uct*uring
Th|e members of t\he T~hys~s~e~nkr~upp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favor of the p-l-ans for th'e reorganization o;f t_h_e Group.
According t/o the wis(hes of Thyssenkrupp interim he,a,d, Guido K)erkho)f)f, who w@a@s appointed to th@e meeting on Sunday for th]e ma'nag'e'me'n't board, the crisis-hit g^roup will be split int|o two in!depe!nden!t companies.
Both c+om+pa+nies will have their re+gi+st+er+ed of&fic&e in Essen and will b*e listed on t{h{e s\to\c\k exchange.
Th%e%re will b"e no f-urther downsizing in addition to the re*d*uction*s already k(nown about.
Aft*er tw`o with}d}r}awa}ls, t.he supervisory body only has eight heads on the capital sid(e.
A]nd there are ten emp\loye\e repres)e)nt)at)i)v)es.
The final dec;ision will b[e m}a}de in a general me&e&ting pl-a-nned in 2020.

Barcelona: Police brutality an~d violent Cat|a|lan i+ndepe+n+d+ence activists a.t demonstrations.
Violent clashes by Spanish po-lice-men and C!atalan i]n]depe]nden]ce activists i[n Barcelona with numerous casualties at t(wo concur\r\en\t demonstrations.
A,ccordi,ng to the city administration, about 300@0 police officers fr=om al`l over S#pai#n gathered on Sa{tu{r{d{ay, as about 6<0<0<0 indepen.den.ce activists demonstrated.
T+he Catalan police tried to ke'e'p t_he tw+o pro"t"e"sting groups away from each other.
According to deployment forces, advocates f'o'r in'd'epend'ence a,g,ai,n trie`d to break through the se%c%urity barrie]r.
They attacked the of$f$i$c$ers with paint an|d thr{own objects.
Brawls between the participants of the t>w>o pr!ote!stin!g grou<ps were also r\ep\or\ted.
2;4 people w^er^e injured according t/o the rescue forces.

Better salar&i&es and a_p_p_r_e_c_iat_i_on of colleagues
The police had wa$nte$d to pay tribute to th!e!i!r colleagues who had op_p_os_e_d the independence referendum i]n Catalonia ba~nne~d almost exact{ly a year ago by th>e Spanish ce<ntra<l g)o)v)ernme)nt.
They d$em$and$ed better salaries a#t th(e same time.
Mem>bers of the Spanish police an&d th`e Guardia Civil thought it was unfair that Catalan a,nd Basque p<olice officers w:ere earning much mo%re th^a^n the^y were.
T:h:e demonstrators found it pr'ovocativ'e that t.h.e Spanish police d/e/m/o/n/strat/e/d in Barc&el&on&a of all places.
W|hy di'd they come here to protest? T/he 55-;year o-l-d Catalan demonstrator Manel Perez asked the ne]ws agency AF"P.
S!imply to pr}ov}o}ke and to ce*le*b*r*ate the fact th?at they worked u_s over a ye`ar ago.
A 31-year-old policeman from t/he Balearic Isl;ands, wh{o said his na;m;e i&s Daniel, rejected t*he accusation.
O?f course we want to s\uppo\r\t ou;r comrades who were only d?oing t&heir j?ob a year ago: d:e:f:e:nding the l<aw, he said.
But th@e demonstration i:s her*e t:o enforc\e our rights and we '[re doing it in Barcelona, because it is a major Eu#rop#ean city an=d there i*s more ech/o here.
However, he a}n}d his co:llea:gue:s did “ no"t come here t%o provoke, ” the p<olice<man ensured u\s.

Football: Ju-vent-us tra{in{er ap,plauds t}h}e top gam/e: Ronaldo ’ s best game
The Portu+guese star striker ‘ this e_ve_ning played the b`es`t game i[n addition to Valencia ’ s half hour ’, c(om(mend(ed Juven^t^us coach Massimilia+no Allegri a-fter the 3(:1 (1@:1) victory of t*he r-ec-ord champion against SSC Na;po;li.
For the coach, the expe]nsi]vely purchased s,tar wit\hout scoring h!imself was th\e decisive man of t`h`e ma`t`ch in the important game aga\i\nst the pursuers.
Ro!n!aldo had a lot of fun and d|id it w)e)l)l, s$aid A;llegri.
Eve)n if we started with tactical er~ror~s, Ronaldo wa;s very good with ou|r first goa{l and we j]us]t g#o#t better from then onw^ar^ds.
Thank^s to Ronaldo ’ s t^h^r^e^e assists, J>u>ve struck back i(n the game aft:er being dow"n early through the g|oa|l b`y Dries Mertens (10th M}in}ute) an<d in the t+hick o]f t=hi=n=gs the pursuer was put off for the time be`i`ng.
The goal-getter brought in fro|m Madrid f`irst t)ack)l)ed t'h'e form#er Bundesliga professional Mario M;an;dzukic, wh}o provided a double score (2]6./49 .) fo'r the lead.
And Ronaldo provided th?e b=u=i=ld-up w*i*t*h a head ball from a corner shot, f[or the g)oal b[y t|he defe~nce leader L|e|ona|rd|o Bonucci (76), w}ho just h{ad to make a sho<rt push i<n, in fron,t of the goal line.
He gives a lo't, said t<he train~er.
Bu[t na}tur}ally Allegri will a/l/so see goals f;ro;m the attacker, who i\s the rec[or[d goal scor,er in both the Cham.pi.ons League and in the P!o!rtugues!e national team.
We have t$o get b>ett>e>r a@t serving him, the coach sa~id.
Currently Man*dzukic i_s the best Juve sc%ore%r with four go!a!ls - Ronaldo has th;re;e.
The superiority of J+uve+ntu+s s]ee]m]s e%ven more o}ver}whe}lm}ing, with th?e purchase o=f Ronaldo, for more than 100 million Euro*s.
Se>ven wins in seven g<am<es i<s the fla^w^less s.er.ies i_n Series A . With 21 points t.h.e masters o(ver the past seven years already have a six-point l?e?a?d ov=er Napoli.

I do n@o@t know wha/t to think of tha+t, h\e struggled for wo~rds.
We did no~t ge+t any a@c@c@ess to t#hem . With ‘ th<em ’, he allegedl[y m+ea+nt the wing players Colby McGill and Janis Kröger, b_ut probably als)o a>ll th(e other green and whites, who made themselves noticeable w{ith their collect$iv$e offensive u`rge.
He c,oul,d still laugh: `@` A filthy win, '-' he s;aid, winking cheekily and th#en we/n/t off . Hi!s pla"yers, on the other hand, we=re relieved to hav#e gotten a:w:a:y with three po.ints.

With understandably mixed feel;i;ngs, GWA coach Sven Lewandows+ki looked back a;t the 9`0 mi~n~u~te~s.
That was by far our b-es-t p~erfo~rmance o\f th#e season, h*e says.
It was p,henome,nal h+o+w we co;me back f}rom t-he 0-2 d-r-a-w a"nd held up against on'e of the lea\gu\e's top teams over the entire match.
Hen}ce, t_h_e more bitter i$t see:m:s, that the<y had to go home empty-handed.
T>op scorer L;ars Z_ymner shot his team in the lead with his 12+th . Goal thi)s seas)on (minute 2|4).
He ne(ed(e(d exactly t\wo touches in th]i]s g?a?me for this goal.

We kn!e!w it, but y:o:u jus{t ca n/'t completely take ou?t a player l?i?ke that.
It was amazing what h/e d{id, Lewandowski ungrudingly r*ec*ogniz*e*d the opponen@t ’ s quali{t{y.
Just before switching sid.es, hi/s own team mana[ged to score t`h`e equalizer: McGill ’ s free kick from t|h|e left side sa;iled between Hövelma@nn and Con]c]o]rd]ia goalke!epe!r Hinkerohe into the l+o+ng goal co^rne^r (45t&h minute).
After s~witchin~g sides, it wa)s McGill a>gain who scored th$e e#q#uali#z#er (59th mi.nu.t.e).

From clean fruit t)o ec}o}l}ogy
The 125th anniversary o:f the Dist"rict A"sso"ciati"o"n for Gardening and La.n.dscape Conser+vat+i+o+n was c[elebrated with a gala at t?h?e Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
O+n September 29 1893 a fruit s|h|o|w i;n th+e Kulmbach community hall set the l]as]t impulses for the f.oun.ding of t@he K|r|e|isve|rba|nd für Ga"rtenbau u^nd Landespflege Kulmbach (District Association for Gardening and Lan<dscape Conservation Kulmbach), and exactly 125 y:ears later, on Saturday night, t]he ass%o%ci%atio%n celebrated th"e b,i,g a<nnive<rsar<y i~n the Kulmbach Sta>dt>halle (civic centre).
Frankly th]e association ha,d a different name at tha't time: In the ye-ar 1893 t+he mayor Wilhelm Flessa a}m}mo}unc}ed the n"ame as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land '*' (Dis&trict Frui:t Grow&i&ng Association K'ulm'b'ach C=ity and Country).
Th}e pur`po`se of the fruit-growing a}s}so}ci}at}ion d-if-fe-red from that of today ’ s work - i|n fact, i;t was purely about frui]t growing and nobody thought abo&u&t f+l+owers and gardening at tha(t tim_e.
At that time, i?n the er)a of th'e Enlightenment, the fruit t}re}e was a favo_ri_te c#hil#d o'f the elite, explained t<he loc|al history curator Günter Dippold in h)is speech.
Fruit trees lined the h?ighways, so-called in}dustr}ial gardens were creat{e{d a.t sc#hoo#ls.
T-o-da-y fr:ui:t cultivation i*s still th$e task of t/h/e 5+5 g$arde$ni$n$g clubs in th{e district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7 000 members.
But b|y far that is n.ot the en`d of the sc!o!p!e.
Gar#dening clos!e to na(tur(e, biological crop prot:ec:t:ion, village beautification and nu?tri?t?ion play j.ust as important a role as does communicating kn&owl&edge ab[out healthy di,e,ts and youth work.
The members o-f t_he Hutschdorf youth g`r`oup "Maulwürfe" (moles) sh<o<wed entertainingly on st]ag]e h|o|w versatile th(e tasks of a gardening c^lub ar%e.
Y*ou*th work is critically i"mp"or"t"ant, espe,cially in the d\i\gital age, s[aid Günter Reif, chairman of the district council, and the l<o<rd ma}yor Hen&r&y Sch]ra]mm a`l`so emphasised how i>mpo>rtant experiences in nature are f!o!r life.
Co}l}lec}tin}g chestnuts was for us as c-h-i-ld-re-n a huge t,hing, I d.ou.b.t that w!ith Sma~rt~ph~o~n~e & Co{. i\t is possible to c/ol/lec/t a similar quantity of joy.
Schramm promised to plan`t two trees for th!e anniversary w<it<h di[s[trict admi|n|is|tra|t|o|r Klaus Peter Söllner.
Where the t-rees will be planted wil}l be dec.ide.d by t?he district association, added district administrator Söllne"r and emphasised the spec*i*al i(m(p(o(r(ta(nce o?f the gardening a\ssocia\tions for t(he villages.
The di]strict association s_tands for e`co`l`o`gy, the beauty o'f th@e garden and green spaces in t]he village.
The f/a/c/t that this is a real concern of t;he ma"n"y ga=r=den=i=ng associations in the d;istr;i;c;t, w"a"s also s:t:a:te:d without doubt b#y the c^o^unty manager an`d consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He presented the numerous visitors an i+l+lust+rated lecture ab;o;ut the long history o"f t@h@e district association and r$e$porte$d a!mong other things, h&ow neces_sary self-sufficiency was after the w]a]r.
In the old da/y/s everything c-ame from the garden, f,o,r the wi\n\ter c>on>serves were m=ade.
At th;e end o/f the 50s, the kitch#en garde_n was transformed i}n}t}o an or?namental and live-in garden.
N:atur:e endures, i>t existed b:efore u=s and we must adapt ourselves to it, pleaded th~e s.pe.ci.ali.st in fruit a!n!d nu?t trees.
Th?ere is an incentive therefore f_or the ga^rde^ning associations n=ot to give up, so t{ha{t ou:r country remains beautiful an'd worth liv'i'ng.
Also involved is the welcoming of ne`w citize"ns to ou`r associations, explained th(e President o-f th-e Bavarian Association, Wolfr'am Vaitl.
We must stop t'he blatant decl"ine i]n i~n~s~e~c~ts, we o-we it to our children an)d grandchildren, Günter Reif concluded the s?u?cces?s?ful cer@e@mony, which was festively framed b(y the towe{r bras=s musicians of the T/h/urn/au music association.

Priority o,n Na}fta talks: C|anad|a ’ s foreign minister reschedules U\N speech
Me%x%ico ’ s go}v}e}r}nm}ent w,a,nts clarity i}n Nafta i`s`s`ues: Both trading pa*rtn*e*r*s are set a>n ultimatum for an agreement.
Canada ’ s foreign minister i&s now giving t!ra!ding agreements a>bso>lute priority - a@nd is delaying her sp=ee=ch for th]e Uni\te\d Nations.
Due t&o the t(ime pressure involved i:n the struggle for a n-ew edition of the North American free t:rade a^greem^en^t (Nafta) w;it;h th.e U&SA and Mexico, the Canadian f/o/rei/gn minister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech a-t t]he U'N general de`bate i?n New York.
In^st^e^ad of today, Saturday, t(he minister will not spe-a-k before the Uni\t\e\d N+at+i+ons general assembly u#ntil Monday, sh[a[re[d her spokesperson Adam A:usten.
In the m<e<anti<me s[h[e will co*nce*nt*r*a*t*e on the rene"g"otia"t"i"o"n of Nafta.
On F\r\id\ay t$he Mexican Ec'onom'y Minister Ildefonso Guajardo explained tha{t Canada and the US!A had 48 h+our+s to a{gr{ee if Canada reall~y wanted t<o join th+e trade agreement that ha\d already bee*n made between his country and the USA.
In Augus|t th^e USA an-d Me!x!ico agreed o|n a new version of the regional Nafta free trade agree(men(t.
US Presi[den[t Dona{ld Tru"mp indicated that Canada could be excluded from Na)fta in fu*t*ure.
Th.e talks c%oncerni%ng revision have bee`n ongoing f&or over a year.
They wi:ll have concluded b`y Sunday evening (l#oc#al time) and Trump ’ s g"o"v"er"nment will subm/it the agr[eem[ent t|o th.e US Senate b)e)fo)r)e October 1.
On Friday Mex&i&c&o ’ s President-elect Andres M[an[uel López Obra_do_r announced t^h^at shou@ld the ne!got!i!a!ti!o!ns fail then Mexico w`ould attempt a~chi~eving a bilateral agre(e(ment with Canada.

Protests aga?in?st presid%e%n%tia%l candidate Bolsonaro
Braz?i?lian p(residential candidate Jair Bo`lson`aro, who was inju)r)ed in a knife attack, ha@s be#e#n released f@rom the hospital.
Accordi]n]g to a report in the daily newsp'aper "O Glo(b(o", the far-right ex-military wa(nted t(o fly t|o his hometown Río d$e Jan;eiro.
After his r;elease, it i&s still u@nc@lear whether the 63-year-old will at*tend an,y events in the last week before th:e presidentia\l elec+tio+ns.
Th.e politician had been attacked on the street in early Sep`t`e`m`ber during a|n election campaign i{n sout]h]e]r]n Bra)z)il.
Meanwhile, in s#e#ver#a#l B-razil-ia-n cities, thousands o*f p%eople took to the s{tr{eets to demonstrate ag]a]i]n]st Bolsonaro.
Under t:he ti*tle "E-l-e nã}o" (E+nglish: "Not him '%'), especially women's associations protes+t+ed against the ex+-mi+lita+ry.
The associations also took to social medi-a to prote]s]t against Bo)lsonar)o '<s racist and mis)o)g)y)n)ist stat@emen@ts.
Several tho_usand demonstrators were expected i_n t~he economic hub S_ão Paulo.
In t>he capital o$f Brasilia, pro)t)es)ts mixe[d wi$th a rally of the presidential candidate o.f th|e Brazilian Wo(rkers ’ Party (PT), Fernando Had(d(ad.
He t%o%ok t[h[e position of former president Inácio Lul;a da Silva, who ha^d bee'n sent_en_ce_d t&o twelve yea/rs i:n p=ri=s=o=n due to corruption and therefore cannot stand for the presidency.
T?he pre<s<id<entia<l election in Br;azi;l will be on Octob/er 7.
A~s the former m;ay;or of th'e megacity of Sã%o Paulo, Haddad has s;o far been behind th!e extreme right can=didat=e Bolsonaro according t$o polls.
The “ T/rum/p o_f Brazil ” ha*s been in politics for a long time, but on+ly recently ha{s presented himself a+s an a:n:ti-:sy:st:em c`an`didate.
I~f none of the candidates rea;c;h abs/olu/te majority i'n t&h&e f%ir%st round, there wil'l be a runoff election on October 28th.
Experts a'ss'u'me th/at Bolsonaro wi~l~l not be vi*ctoriou*s - no matter w*h*o he is up a'g'a'in'st.
Bolsonaro is known for being ag,a,ins,t g:ay and b/la/c/k peop~le and for glor)ify)i)ng t\he military dictatorship (1964-1985).
H&e shocks the peopl%e of B\r\azil wit%h verbal d>e>ra>il>me>nts over and over again.
Once he sa(id that t,he suppo#r#t#er#s o{f Lula's left-wing Labor P]arty should be s+hot dead.

Following a l\o\ng illness: Danish rock lege.n.d d|i|e|d
The Danish rock i}c}on Ki$m Larsen is d>ea>d.
The sing?e?r di|e|d on S^un^da^y at the age of 72 f'ollowi'ng a long illness, sh'ared his p&roduc&er Jörn Jeppesen o,n L*ar*sen ’ s website.
Larsen was surrounded o'n his dea/thbe/d by his wi_fe and s~ix children.
Since the b=eginning of t)he year the mu^sician had been un&de&r treatment for p{r{osta{te cancer.
Larsen b,ecame famous wi=th the ba)nd G[aso[lin', which i|n the 1970s w"a"s enormously successful in Scandinavia.
Their songs w[er[e influen>ce>d by m'usic great<s such as Jimi H]e]ndrix, Bob Dylan and the Be?atles.
I%n 1978, afte#r the dis;soluti;on o'f the band, Larsen was successful a)s a s/ol/o artist.
H%e sold about t/hree million records in D)en)ma)rk.
His album `*` Midt om natten"' from 1983 i@s s^till the best-selling al`bum i#n Denmark.
The Danish Prime Minister Lars Lök'ke Rasmussen pa%id tribute to Lar<sen on Sunday as a `:` street b(oy '*' w~ho was "a{ga{i{nst everything, but in ev+e+r+yone ’ s hear\t\s."
The head of g~ov~ernm~ent al/s/o recalled that in t'h'e yea=r 2010 t;he monarchy opponent Larsen pe=rfor=med on th%e occasion of the 70th birth[d[a[y of the Danish Qu$ee$n Margrethe II.
A n@igh@t of r#ock i[n the shoe f~ac~t~or~y: Loud as a jackhammer
Here w@e stand, ta\king the b>one sa]w and igniting a concert evening with the strength of a ti$g$er . The band na#mes Here W}e S/ta/n/d, T-i-ger Bonesaw and Th,e Ignition al`one s/ugg/es/t s`uch a d;escr;ipt;io;n of the rocking live m~us~i~c event on Saturday evening in t:he ha[ll of the Bürgerzentrum S-chuh-fabrik, t!he community center housed in an ol%d shoe factory: Pur:e hard rock brought to yo>u by t&hree bands wh-o are also friends.
After t;h;e soundcheck and shor`tly before the start o]f t=h=e concert, t(he musi|ci|an|s take tim>e for a group photo.
There is no hi$n$t o<f stage fri!ght i@n the process.
Afterwards, the lead singers a.nd their bands from Ah]len and the surrounding area - al;l of the'm associated with t!he Mosquito bookin/g agency f$rom Oelde - vis#ibly enthrall th&e ap_p_r_oximately 120 v.isi.tors of the Mint Mosquito ro\c\k nig/h/t w!i!th their loud performances.
Ki/cking things off, the Tiger Bones/aw quartet around fr)ontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika manages t;o win t"he crowd with their l}a}t}est, unknown pieces, which t~he band penn}ed themselves f$or th,eir soon to b|e released C<D.
In front o#f the s~ta~ge, people dance to t\he powerful yet h-arm-on-iou-s band p{erfo{r{mance.
Despite loud c.alls f^or an e.n.co.r.e, Tig$er Bonesaw then ha+nd over the reigns to the three-member Here W;e S:ta:nd.
Guitarist Sa/s/cha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on ba:s:s, and drummer K{a{i Hölscher demonstrate the variety within hard ro*c*k with t~heir alterna{tive sound, which i%s s]o]meti]mes r(em(i(nisce(nt of 1970`s classic rock.
Following the hi.gh energy rock of the Tigers, Here We Sta*n*d ad)ds a synth]esize]r o&n top o`f t|h|e guitar sound.
Among other tit,les, the yearning, almost ballad$-$lik$e Take Me Home captivates the audie|nce by switching betwe-en melodi]c passages and the guitar-heavy rock re<ef<s typical o|f th|e multi;-;la;ye;red s?o?ngs.
Meanwhile, th]e q~uartet The Ig}n}itio}n fro,m Tönnishäuschen have earned a special reputation s'inc'e the band formed in 20\05.
T'h'e ban{d presented their full)-ene)rgy hard rock on Saturday.
I=t is obvious a:n:d un@mi@s@taka@bl@e t)ha)t The Ignition have a great deal o^f stage experience from their performances i*n fron@t of v@ery large a?udience?s - recently documented in a film b|y Ma}x Meis about the 2017 China tou,r.
Playing of]f his band, S>in>g>er and guitarist Tim Jungmann has hi>s very own t}ake on t?he even`ing ’ s o^nly cover - Wo(rd Up b*y Cameo from t"he 80s.
Meanwhile, it fe%e%ls like the volume is d^ia^led u@p ev;en higher than before a]s guitarist Norbert Brinkmann del^ive^rs a sol-o whil-e r{unning through the cheering crowd.
Of course, wh}en it comes to hard rock conc}erts, a certain dec}i}bel level has to be ex_p_ect_e_d: Accor-ding t<o the sound crew, th~at l?e?ve?l was a^round 98 decibels f|or the three ba^n^d concert w^i^t^h Here We S*ta*nd, Tiger Bonesaw, and The Ignit\i\o\n during t>h>e Mint Mosquito night o/f r/o/ck.
That is approximately t\he sa@m@e level as a jackhammer, w!hich i+s still significantly lower than the p'e'a'k volumes at Wacken Open A,ir f%esti%v%al referen+ced o%n the band website of The Ig'ni't'i'on.
However, t<he A]hl]en a?udi?ence h*as no need during th+is n}ight of ro]ck for 120 decibel sound a*s loud as a jet eng*ine, as is common a{t the heavy metal get together i'n th{e north of Germany.
A]fter just under four hours, t,he three hard rock bands ha)ve long si=n=c=e w]on t~he audie|n|c|e over with their co>nf>id>e>nt, expert p.er.formanc.e and own songs.
In th?e end, al"l thr]e]e b{an{ds can hones>t>ly, if figur,ati,vely, s?a?y: `|` Here we stand, having taken t$he bone s&aw and ignited a concert evening with t|he strength o^f a tiger."
Ab.o.ve a/ll, th.ey enjoyed the plentiful applause f+r+om the audience.

It is no se+c+ret that t_he US President i's well d]isposed to#war#ds N@o@rth K~orea ’ s ruler Kim, despite th[e nuclear crisis.

Laschet urg~es Turkey to ac`t according to t`h`e rule o=f law
Col)ogne - According to the Minister Presiden;t o}f NRW Arm|in Laschet (CDU), du*r*ing his ta;lk;s with Turkish P=residen=t R*ecep Tayyip Erdogan, c^alle^d for the rule o_f law i%n Turkey.
T*he relationships of bo$t$h countries a-r-e currently ‘ oversha!dowed ’, Laschet s<aid o-n Sat~ur~da~y, following a meeting w(ith Erdogan at Cologne airport.
These concerns are related to all th-e arrest waves, freedom o/f me<dia an!d r}eligio}n.
H@e therefore made i!t clear to Erdogan that "i?f i]n the future r?e?l?atio?ns are going to b>e>c>o>me normal and if economic rela|tions are going t'o de}epen, then the rule of l'aw i@s a very important c)on)d)ition."
According to La\sch\e\t, h^e als/o refe*rr*e*d to th\e cases of Germans bein@g imprisoned in Turkey.
He ha<d ex(p(ress(e(d the hope that freedom of expression w[ould be respe"c"ted.
T$hereu$p$on Erd~og~an once again underlined the independence of Tur+ki+s+h system o<f justice.
Th_e conversation between L{as{chet and Er,doga,n h}a}d been transferred t+o the building of the Executive Transpo!r!t Wing of t^he Federal Ministry of D}efen}ce at Cologne Ai!rpo!rt.
Originally i{t should hav:e taken place at Wahn cast*le - but the cast.l.e o;w;ners declined due to political v<iews against Er?do?gan.
After th|e speech E`rdo`gan went t'o the opening of the D[it[ib Mosque i<n Cologne.
Laschet de+clined a j|oint appearance in t'he building.
He did say tho,u,g,h: ‘ The Muslims wh\o go t:o t}hi}s mosque, are also citizens o`f ou}r cou;ntr;y ’.
And we a}re their co}n}tact pers{ons - and not the Turkis<h president.

While U#S Pr?es?id?e?nt, Trump d=oes not t`ire of high#l#i#gh#ti#ng t?he success of negotiations over North Korea ’ s de?n?uclearization, the E"ast Asian regi(m(e is describing relations m&ore demurely.
Foreign Minister R\i ca>lls for a concession f"rom Washington.
North Kor:ea ’ s Foreign Minister Ri Yong H<o, s:p:ea:ki:n:g at the UN G"eneral Deb;a;te, h%a%s a`ccu`sed the US government of stalling n%eg%otiations for a nuclear-free Ko?re?a?n peninsula t(hrough continued san%cti%on%s.
The recen*t st|andsti|l|l h.a.s seen the US i-m-plem-e-nti-n-g coercive measures, which a+re lethal to trust-building, said R!i i,n New York.
Disa`rmame`n`t under these circumstance wo:u:ld b<e unthinkable for North K?orea.
Without a,ny trust in the US, there is no t?r?u?st in ou~r national security a.nd un_d_e_r s,u,c,h circumstances t,he,r,e i`s no way t*h*at we c)a)n disarm ourselves first, the Nor?th Korean head di:pl:o:mat said.
The i~de~a t,h,at Nort@h Korea could b<e ‘ brought to its knees ’ due t*o th~e s{anctions, is ‘ a pipe d#r#eam of people who d$on ’ t k,n,o,w us ’.
To b/u/il/d trus#t his country has stopped i,ts atom and mi.s.s.ile te+s+t+s and has destroyed a nuclear te/st system, Ri sa[id.
However, the USA h>as shown n<o "c}or}responding reactions" to t#h#at, t\h\e minister cr_it_i_cised.
L?ast year alone, becaus&e of N@or@t@h Korea ’ s n=uclear and mis^sile pro|gra|m, t_he UN Security Council p!a!s!sed sanctions on the internationally isolated country thre+e times.
In recent day:s t{he US President Donald Trump and hi!s Secretary o^f Sta&te M`i`ke Pompeo have b\ee\n pushing for strict adherence to t|h|e sanctions at the Unit$ed Nations.

Youth from t@he Ho$T had conjured up the buffet wi(t(h delicacies from different countries i_n the n~e~w k/i/tchen.
The f`acility w)as financed by dona~tions from the community, fo\r which the youth wanted t$o e^xpr^ess t^h^ei^r thanks with the meal.

We had already filled ou)r refrigerators w@ith food and i^ng^redien^ts before the sum_me_r b|re|ak, and we were well prepared fo&r the b;ig d`ay.

N\o\w we h(a(d to start from t(he b]eg]inning aga{in: We go_t a l>ot of support fro)m friends and neighbors, but the children an-d youth wanted to do it a/l/one, says We{stb{uer.
A%nd so ev?eryo?n?e helped.
T/h/e result was impressive an<d th[e guests were excited.
Professi-o-nal chefs could not d)o an)y better either, an imp"r"es"s"e"d visitor said, w:hile Hokkaido pumpkin soup wa$s served and the guests enjo$yed quiche, meatloaf o!r c@ake.

Jürgen S^ator leaves the NRW executive b{oa{rd of th\e Tafel
Out of frustration over criticism fr;om their own ra~nks, the he!ad of th@e Essen Ta(fel, J;ö;r;g Sartor, has giv&e&n up hi\s position.
Sa?rtor ha+d become kn#o#wn nationwide because the Essen Tafel ha"d i}n}trod}u}ced a limit for foreigners.

Sartor took th?e sh~ar~p criticism t#o heart.
I can unders)ta)nd his step - many pe;ople s+p+oke up who di^d not even know exactly w:hy the Essen Ta-f-e-l does t~hat.
But Sartor i-s s)ti)l)l working for th;e Essener T%a%fe%l - “ s?i?x days a week, n^othing h,a,s changed about i#t, ” says Weilerswist.
S(ar(tor c{r{i{tici{zed colleagues fr}om other Tafe#l associations in "Welt a/m Sonntag . ".

N?ow we are overtaken by reality, said Thomas Müller a]fte]r t'h'e 0-2 defeat o'f H~erth~a BS"C and asks f%or a retu;rn leg i$n the Champions League duel wi!th Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone wh%o kno&ws u<s, i"s a>w>are t(hat we are really ang-ry and that is why we will crank up on Tuesday.
For the first t$ime within more than a y^e^ar of pl)ayin)g aw|ay there wer]e scored n{o goals, as at the sam[e time tw:o mandatory p,r,e,s,ea,son games i\n series without a victory, the le}ague le(a(ders in the Bundesliga lost t(o Borussia D,or,tmu,n,d.
The overall situatio*n is no.t nearly as dr,am,ati,c as th'e final p`hase of the fai*led Carlo Ancelotti at the e]n]d o(f September 2017, b.ut the champions shall b"e aware.
Th+e FC Aug[sb[ur[g with the 1:1 ratio having its long r#unning man-on-man tactics a>nd the Berlin through i/t/s pla<yful pi:np:ric:k:s over the outside hav;e delivered within two days tw`o similar blueprints, as the la|st overpowering app[e[ar[ing o-f Bay?ern failed.
Those who know Bayern are aware th@a@t w[e will n/o/t put u`p with that and th$at we wil]l d$o everything to become su'cc'ess'ful again, Kovac sai,d.
Apa|rt from thi[s, he quietly bypassed hi-s native city with h+is losers and put his first de%fe%at as Munich coach down to t~h~e ina|de|qu|ate handlin<g o&f opportunities.
A win o@ve@r Am_ste_r_dam and Bor:ussia Monch}englad}bach on Saturday wou&ld make the first preliminary conclusion of his ter&m bei;n;g positive before th(e international b\r\ea\k - otherwise the tone will probably get wor;s;e.
So before t)he second prem"ier class appearance in this season af+t+e+r the 2-`0 over Be?nf?ica Lisbon, Kov!ac undertook no ext&ra&ordi&nar&y measures.
As it was planned, af>ter t+he da@y off on Su]n]d]ay started quick pre)p)ara)t)i)on for the second preliminary roun!d match agai%nst Ajax, w,h,o beat AEK A,the,ns co!nfid!ent!ly 3-0 as well.
No_w they ’ ve s/core/d a victory ove`r us i`n two gam&es, but we wil#l also reach our g?o?als ag+ai+n, announced captain o^f the national t_eam Manuel Neuer.
A#l#r#e#a#dy af^ter th/e lost cu|p final ag?ainst Eintracht Frankfurt, at the s:ame position the most n)ot)abl)y in plain text spoke Joshua K[immich.
The right de:f:e:nder ta]k]e on the role o:f admonisher.
I do not believe t^ha^t t)his is al/l b+ad luck, we need t&o work i$t o}u}t again, because we do n;ot g!o for m+os+t of t#he opportunities and make mis/take/s, said t=he 23-year-old shortly before leaving the Olympic stadium.
O|n t,he seventh match day of the previous season Bayern wa's e+ven f>ive points behind Dortmund, which has n^ow taken over with o)ne poi(n(t ah#ea#d.
A-nd so Kimmich appreciated on]l]y wit-h a shrug of it&s shoulders a%t least posi%t%iv%ely, that now t%he public deba't'e abo=ut supposedly invincible Bavaria has ended.

DF{B boss c>o>mes under fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack o]f Erdoga'n o>n Grindel
The Turkish p]re]si]d]e]nt Erdogan condemns the exclusion of Mesu!t Özil a+nd Ilka-y Gündogan in Germa#ny amidst ser"i"ou"s accusations.
T"he DF\B president Grindel admits mist?ake?s but upholds th&e asso{c{iat{ion ’ s line.
N&ow wil.l be created a new po<st.
Ber/l/i/n - Recep Tayyip Er(dogan and Reinh$ar$d G{r{i{nde{l fought on different stages for interpretation in t'he length$y Mesu't Özil dispute.
After the Turki.sh President criticized the speech of t+h+e fo^rm^e^r world champion in Ge{r{ma{ny a+t the opening o(f large Ditib Mosque in C@ologne, the h[ead of D`FB upheld the a^s^so^c^iation ’ s l;in;e.
E^ar^ly on Sunday mo(r(ning, Grindl, w=ho h"ad been pe/r/sonall/y attacked by Özil, reported on the c(on(se(qu(e(nces o;f the issue o/n the Mainz ZD@F “ Sp<ort studio ”.
A{s we have a lo#t of players wit&h a migr:a:t:ion background i"n t+he U teams, i+n f@utu@r@e we must draw v%e%ry s"pecif"ic con*clusi*o*ns, s?o something lik=e this this does not ha#ppen again, said the 5'7-'year'-o'l'd an^d plans to get a national player wi]t]ho]u]t a migration background as an additional integration official.
G[rin[de[l also explained ag#ain that Erdogan does not s&tand for the values o=f fo_otba_ll an\d the DFB.
T*h*e l%a%tt%er was very c]ri]t]i]ca]l o=f the racism against Özil an>d Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Me<sut Özil, born a(nd raised in Germany, an'd ou}r Ilka?y.
They excluded them from t%h%is association because th#ey allowed me to be photographed wit}h the"m in Engla<nd, '\' said Er>d>ogan i!n Domstadt on Saturday.
Fra;nkly speaking, a<s th|eir president, I could not accept t#he fact that our two you$ng men, who h?ad been r[i[sen to t}he German n<a<t<i<onal team, we|re excluded.
Gr{indel poi;nted at Gündogan's statement that in con,tras,t to Özi-l, after the World C[up affair, which had been taken photos o$f the two with Erdogan, he fel%t tha|t he w%as `<` reaso^na^bly treated b/y the DFB '^'.
He also sa=id h'e w}an}t}ed to stand u`p for players in future.
T/hat t$hi$n$g they say: I|f I w)in - I ’ m Ge_r_m_a_n, if I los}e - I ’ m a migrant - th%at will no?t wor+k.
I am ve.ry so;rr;y that he had su[c[h an im=p=r=es=sion, said Grin@d@e@l.
I ’ ve alwa~ys said th^a^t we h#a#d to defend Mesut m&ore.
Ye*t he does not s_ee grounds for Ö$z$il to return t=o the national te}am.
As a c]o]n]seq]ue]n]ce, in a_ddit_i_on to the native Brazilian C*acau a.n.d Celia S%asi%c of Cameroon ancestry, now sh^ould b;e appointed an additional int"e"gratio"n rep=res=en=ta=t=iv=e.
I&f someb^od^y without a migration background i+s an obvious influencer in s:ociet:y and football and s~ays: T!he issue i@s an important one, w#e need to do something about it ’, t?h?i?s w_ould a\l\so b?e an initiative t*o provide a better foundation for our local team@s, wher?e inte\gration needs to wo}rk ’, Gr_ind_e_l said.
Despite the cr-it-ici-sm of hi>s person af[ter the World Cup a$n$d t}he Özil affair, h_e wants to run for the pos@t of DFB President agai@n ne;x;t year.
I do my w%ork an\d take care I d@o it a"s w^ell as p&ossibl&e, Grindel said.

On thursday, it wa?s reported that the`re is no longer a th`r`eat of th'e f'ire spreading t$o adjacent com>muni>ti>e>s.
At ti+mes more than 1,5%00 deployment for|ces o)n site attempted to ge*t the big f#i#r#e under control.

Almost exa]c]t]l]y a yea]r aft}er marriage became available for e)v)eryo)ne, the pol!iti!ci!an h/as married h/is longtime boyfriend in Hamburg.
The two ha}ve be(e(n together for 25 y^ears.
Ham\bu\rg - Almost a year aft@e@r marriage came int(o force for everyone, the SPD politician Joha!n!ne!s K!ahr!s married his long-te@rm b/oyf/rie/nd Chris~toph Rohde.
T>h>e two exchanged vows o:n Saturday in H/amburg.
Kahrs p(re(vi(ou(sly told t(he “ B"ild ” newspaper that a registered civ*il partnership was no&t for t.hem.
If we g&et mar*r*ie*d, then ri{gh{t.
H$e has been with his partner for 2(5 yea,rs.
T>he 55-_y_ea_r_-_old Kahrs i?s the f&i&s&cal policy s]peaker for the SPD parliamentary group in t'h'e German Bundestag and is one of t_he Seeheim reg~io~n speakers of t>he conservative SPD w\in\g.
On June 3)0, 2017 Kahrs caused a huge stir a{bout the ope!ning of marriag<e to homosexuals i{n th@e Bundestag d-eb-at-e.
He h;ad accused Chancellor Ang!e!la Merkel (C-D-U) of "stumbling '>' on t{he s^ubjec^t.
He felt this was its Schabowski moment, alluding to t}h}e inadvertent announcement o+f th{e East Ger-man border opening b@y G&ün&te&r Sch>abowski.

Switzerland is starting a^n electronic register for orga*n d[o[no[rs
The re}giste}r shou$ld fa:cil:i:tate organ d.ona.tions and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
Swisstransplant emphasizes that the new pro:cess wil!l n~ot cha_nge the way organs are only e@x@tr@acted with ex>p>ress consent.
(dp!a) Switzerland s)ta)rts i#ts e^l^e^c^t^r^on^i^c register fo(r organ donation this Monday.
Thi&s should facilitate o%r%g%an donat{ions and relieve relatives in stressful si't'u'a'tio'ns.
Those who want to donate their o~r~g~ans in cases o~f dea`th, ca[n re\gi\ster themselves.
Your wishes will then be available t[o Swi#sstr#a#ns#pl#ant, i"f r'e'q'uired.
Swisstransplant emphasizes that the n"ew process will not change the way organs are o?nl?y extracted wi#th express con!s!ent, as i`s the ca\s\e i{n Ger{many.
It is assumed th}at 1}5 percent o~f th]e Swiss have donor cards, says Franz Im<mer, Directo;r of t-he Swisstransplant foundation.
B!ut on#ly in five percent of ca`se`s, a card i!s found a@t the crucial mom"e"n"t when donating is p^ossible.
In o?ver 6<0 percent of con~v~ersa~ti~ons, re]l]a]t]iv]es d{o no|t know the dead person ’ s intentions.
Y_o_u t/hen have to decide on beh(a(lf o[f the decease'd, according to their w'i's'h, which i\s often very stressful, says I.mm.er.
A sim'ilar regis#tra#ti#on s$yst$em already exists in Great Britain.
In G.ermany, the record"i"ng of details about possible organ donation on the healt>h card has be)en considered, as stated b?y the sp!eak!er f-o-r th\e F;ed;er;a;l Office for He.al.t.h Education, Marita Vö?lke?r-A?lbe?rt.
There i.s n_o register w[here peo:p:l:e ca$n record their wish|e|s, for or against organ donation, she says.
Federal Health Minist>e>r h?a?s spoken ab&out ne-w guidelines for organ donation.
Ac,cordi,n,g t;o his sugge)st)i)o)n, e!veryone will be c_o_nsi_d_ered an organ donor, unless he/she o&r relatives contradict this.
Among o*th*ers, the C&at&h&o&l&ic Church o`bj`ec`ts the proposed r+e+gul+ation.

On M%onday farmers ar#e a?llo?w?ed to start t?he annual hedge bank maintainance
On Mo,nda,y Schleswig-Holstein farmers ca}n start with t'he a%n%nual hedge bank maintainance.
For around 2#00 years, th;e "green ramparts" which ar[e un*iq*ue in Ger'many, hav@e shaped the landscape of t[h[e forest-poor st$a$te.
Th_e tre;e and undergrowth hedges, u$p to five meters wide, a|r|e ‘ forest replacements ’ and fo^r m#any animals an`d plants are the last area*s o`f retreat.
Hedge bank.s connect a\s corri-do-rs s\catte\r\ed habitats, through w}hich the exchange of org"an"i"sm"s c_an stil)l fu]nc]tio]n, as the executive director o#f the Nature An!d Biodiversity C^o^nser^vat^io^n Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
He-dge banks a)r)e living fences
In t+he year 1#766 t@h@e hedge banks were created at t_he command of t@he Danish King Christian VI who r}uled o"v"er Schleswig-Holstein.
The ‘ living fen,ce,s ’ were no&t ju|st fi<el<d boundaries and cattle fencing, t`he`y also provided farmers w=it=h fire;woo;d and beams for th=eir h+alf-+t+im+bered houses.

According to th!e NABU ’ s deta}i}ls they a{re used by approximately 7,000 animal sp)ec)i)e)s as a.n alt"e"rnati"v"e habitat.
O<n<e ki;lo;m;etre o@f he_dge bank may contain up to 1 800 different sp%ec%ies and up to 3%0 pairs of birds ma=y b[reed there.
The hedge ban=k=s can only fulfill their ecologically impor`tan`t role if they ar|e m#aintai#n#ed accordingly i(n th{e winter.
Ot]h]erw]is]e, i.t is stunted to a s{parse tree line, w\hich c*auses not on!l!y losses in b+iodivers+ity b\ut also in the windbreaking ef|f|ec|t, said Ludwichowski.

I arrived there on Sunday morning, because I st{ill had to drive fo~r m=o=re th[an 20 hours b`y c&a&r after the flight as t`h`e airpor_t a[t Palu was c#lo#s#ed at th>e time.
What is the si/tua/ti/o/n o#n th%e island now?
The n;ational government has o`pe`ned the ai>r>port again, so aid s,up,p,l,y ca|n be flown i.n.
When I a$r$riv$ed, I s+a+w t#h#e hou;ses on the coast, which were completel<y d"es"troyed.
Our ‘ Wo>r>ld Vi,sion ’ office i$s also destroyed, but w]e hav"e set something up provisionally, w_he_re other people ha<ve also been acco`m`modated.
Whe~re are the p_e_ople of Su~l~aw~esi living now?
Many ran to the surrounding h\i\lls, wh.ere they held o?ut through fe{a{r of another tsunami and earthq@uake, a@n@d wh+ere there is no access to water an+d f<ood.
Man-y stopped in front o]f their houses w'i'th aftershocks still b^eing experienced.
As many f.ood shops and gas stations a're completely s>hu>t, some peop+l+e are s!tealing provisions a&n&d gasoline.
T@h@e public serv<ice<s have completely shut do^wn and the national government i"s h|elping.
Eve:n a prison was d_e_stroyed, the p|ri|so|ne|rs ar\e running a*roun*d free, and searching f;or them is difficult.
There a/re s-t-il-l l]ot]s o=f bodies lying around, many p_eo_ple have not been found and are m&i&ssin&g.
How i#s the c+o+m+m+u+n+ic+ation and in>form>a>ti>on flow o!n the island?
A{t the mom@ent we h{a{ve mobile re?c?ep?t?ion, which d\i\d not work previously and w+e hav/e been receiving information via radio.
M~any people a}re still l:ooking fo:r their children, neighbors and o"t"he"r persons, not knowing i/f they a|re alive a]nd wher\e they are staying, because p~eo~ple we~re no[t at home during the earthquake and were on the w=ay to wor@k, for example.
T]he t}su}n}a}mi w/arni/ng system did not work correctly.
D^o you ha`ve any information a=b=ou=t this?
We do not know t"h"e reasons f*o*r this, b`u`t when the all-\c\lea\r w_as given, man~y peop.le thought ‘ O:K, n{o tsunami ’, and then i:t came.
In oth$e$r regi(o(ns not affected b=y t&he tsu(na(mi, there was false in+fo+rma+ti+on about a tsunami hitt'in'g the re+g+ion and they ran to the s#urr#o#und#in#g hills.
An island lik"e Su\lawe\s\i that s#its on t_he Pacific rim of fire, is not prepared f<or ea+rth+quakes?
Y%et th|ere are earthquakes every d@ay, but this one was th'e w]orst.
We normally know how t`o react to an earthquake a_nd ar:e t`rai`ned for eva]c]uatio]ns.
But the co#mpl#e#te infrastructure has co.ll.apsed, the earthquake h]as affected a lot o$f peopl!e.

Brett Kavanaugh: H+ig+h-sp+eed FBI inv+e+st+ig+a+tio+n
Time i{s extre<mely tight and th{e number of planned i,nt,er,rogations i!s very restricted.
Republicans in t}he US Senate want the break-neck spee=d FBI inve`stiga`t`ion to he(lp secure a ma&jority fo?r Supreme Court no@m@inee Brett Kavanaugh, whi,ch ha]s become pa{pe{r thin amid allegations of se[xual misconduct.
President Don[a[ld Trump has se<t a dea_dlin_e o+f F_rid_ay for investigators to cl=arify more than 3{0 y`ea`rs of suspected incidents from years back.
The recent turnaround in t*he dr`a`ma surro^und^i^ng Ka\van\aug\h's nomination, whic*h has involved a culture war, had be{en t=riggered on F*riday.
Aft:er an 8:-:ho:ur hearing o?f Ka*v*anau*gh and the first accuser Christine Blasey Ford, i>n w`hich the lawyer directed angry ti-rades a}t the opposition democrats, the Senate Judiciary Comm`itte`e wanted t+o pave the way for final confirma#tion o;f the ultra-sensitive j<u<dge at t@he US Su.pr.e.m.e Court.
The majority of R"e"publ"ic"an"s s<eeme<d assured when Senator J+eff Flake, aga`ins`t hi*s original announcement, suddenly declared he would agr;ee, but dem`anded a{n FBI i)n)v)es)tig)at)io)n.

F'C Schalke 04 after defeating Mainz: Y!o!u could f>e>e>l the f&ea&r
Train|e|r Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated t|he fi,rst wi-n of the s`e`aso`n against Mainz.
The're is a great se}nse of r;e;lie;f a.t Schal"ke after the first win of the sea=so=n.
Nevertheless, t^ime wa#s also a fa%ctor against Mainz.
G!e!ls!en!kirch!e!n - B[y no_w, Christian H{e{idel i>s well-known for being a huge pessimist at football ma"tc"h"e"s.
The ho=me game against M'a'in'z 05 was no d.i.f.fer.ent.
I s,aw e'ver'y ball g&oing in.
And the@re w?ere m@a@ny corners a)nd many balls i<n our penalty are\a, said the sp^orts director of Schalke 04 - an^d breathed a sigh o]f relief.
Afte\r all, the "royal blues ':' ha"d manage,d t(o seal the narrow 1?:?0 win against Mainz over the cour-se of t"he match and thus c,e,le,b,rated the fir:st vic$tory of the season.
In fact, things cou+ld have bee^n ve}r}y different.
After Al*essan*d*r*o Schöpf (11th) had given the t<ea<m o^f he{a{d coach Domenico Tedesco the lead and therefore s&ecurity, Tedesco sa!i!d: "I~n su?m, the fi#rst half was good, both i`n terms of h!ow w<e p/layed and i'n terms of pressing". As t|he m@at@ch continued, mental strength beca.me inc"r"e"as"ingly important.
Schöp`f is usu(a(lly not a\n aerial threat
T]he las~t t)en m-in-utes felt li/ke two hours t-o m;e, said Heide^l: ‘ I c:an understand i$f the team was only half as nervous as I was on th?e bench ’.
T)h)e boys w@e@re afraid to squander the lead an$d therefore kept r-etreati-ng.
And th?r?e?w everything they h.a.d into our defe@ns@e.
To hold o\n to th<e first three points o-f the sea<son.
We al\l f;elt a huge weight lifted of.f o[ur shoulders, sai<d Schöpf, whose scoring header pl,aye,d no insignificant pa-rt: "And I am actually th|e worst header on t)he t<eam . '<'
But i}n t&h&e en#d, victory is all th_at counts.
The relief w(as f_elt thr"ou"gho"ut the entire arena, n(ot l>ea>s>t by Tedesco.
We wan-ted t\o star{t strong in t|h|e early sta!g!e!s and ma?ke a firew\o\rk of it, said Schalke ’ s head coach.
T*he wi%n wa|s an important one.
Finally w|e ca.n enjoy ourselves for a f]ew hours.
I a(m very, very happy for the t`e`am and th#e fan-s.
We played smart, calmly a!n!d with cour>age, th}at i?s how w[e must approach matches over 90 m%inu%tes
The biggest sho=rtc=omi=ng o]f t<h<e afternoon: The "Royal Blues" missed thei}r chance to establish co_nt_r_ol o\v\e\r th/e match early.
A&fter a`ll, they did ge=t th%e%ir chances, for example via the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, who hit t:he crossbar t*w*ice (59th/72;nd) o/r A#m#ine H)arit (62nd).
T<h<a<t way it would n$ot have be<en such a ne*r*ve wrecking v<i<c<tory, said Te>desco: "You r}e}al}l}y c{o{ul{d feel th/e fear a little bit."
So I a`m gl:ad that we w/on.
He was not th;e only o;ne a&t Schalke.
Fischbachau: Smoke co`lu`m`n i!n t=he Leitzachtal visible from 2 k#m
Th"e s>moke was hard t&o miss.
O"n Sunday a(t arou(nd 13.30, at a distance of approximately tw`o k=i=lo=metres a hiker i=n the Leitzachtal observed a fir_e.
The polic$e ar$e now investigating.
Fis;chbac;ha;u - The cause was soo/n discovered by the police and f.ire departments: A stra;nge;r h/ad s^et fire to garbage on a two squ%a%re mete>r ar/e/a a/t Gschwendner Berg.
Accor'ding to th_e police, i[t appears the fire w\as monitored fo+r a long tim)e, but the embers we+re inadvertently left beh+ind.
C;l;o;s;e to the fo;rest too.
30 Fi:schbac:hau firefi<gh<te<rs were tasked with disp.ersing an%d extinguishing it.

P,r,of. D/r. Aladin El-Mafaalani disc%us%s%es integration: A discussion a|t eye level
Professor D)oc)to)r A~la~d~in El-Mafaalani is standing befo(re them.
He h=as o\nc\e again accepted the in,v,i,tatio,n from Ernst R]ei]lin]g a)nd Lore Hauschild.
Fo&r many year, I have made i#t m@y m%is%s%io%n to bring interesting peo]ple to Greven, ex*plains the fo;u;nde;r an^d chairman of the "Reckenfelder Treff '"' - the association tha+t coope=rates in organizing th&e evening wi=th the "Kulturpolitik" a*llian*c*e.
El>-Mafa>alani casually st|arts the reading, describing the writing pr*oc*ess of the bo$ok, talking about how diffi.cult i}t was to explain the top#i#c c!om!pr!ehe!n!s!ib!ly.
With a lo-t of gestures, tangible numb%e%rs and a joke or tw-o, he introduces the a=udi=ence t|o on\e of the most cont:entious topics: Migration an(d int-eg-ratio-n.
W'h'y ar<e there increasingly conflict$s, despite successful integration?
The Syrian-born author u^se^s a m'et'a'phor t@o answer the q_uest_i_on.
The German society sits at t{he big table, th!e migrants of t:he fir!st ge~n~e~ra~tion at th)e k"id ’ s table.
Their children gro#w up in Germany a}n}d want t+o s&it at th{e table.
The third generation of m@igr@an@t@s is born i^n G%e%rm%any . The=y always s!a!t a:t t}he big table a\n\d now want to have a say too.
T;h;is leads to co}nf}lic}t}s.
T{he{r{e{fore, i,t i*s no`t of i$mpor$t$ance whether one i|s politically ri?g?h?t or left, but: "`Am I f#or or against an open society?" he e,mph,as,izes.
A{t first r?a?th?er r)est)rained, then t)h)e discu|ss|ion round gets more and more lively.
A^nd there is a nee&d for d\iscuss\i\on.
A>n Afghan refu^ge^e r"e"p"or"ts from his pe@rs@p@ec@tive, and tw}o teachers ex(pl(ain how they see successful or unsuccessful i:ntegr:a:tion among students.
El-Mafaalani s+t+ands in front o$f th/e stage, not on it, s_y_mbol_i_zing the discussion: I"t i&s a d,is,cussion at eye leve>l.
T]h]e sociology professor does not force his op=inio=n ont=o th$e au!di!en!ce, emphasizing that he speaks of th<e average, no=t o(f individual destinies.
H:e i[s happy that people a;re i|n|teres|ted i<n the topic, because “ we can only find a solution once w;e u[nders[ta[n[d wha~t the pr;o;ble;m is, ” says El-`Mafaala`ni.
E{ve{n during t,h,e subsequent signing session, he still has a?n open e)a)r for the g;ue;sts ’ qu[es[tion[s and t$he discussion continued i~n the foye:r over Kurdish specialties.

Building i<n Landsham: 10|0 app[licat[i[o[ns for 20 properties
The demand is obviously huge: O^ver 100 in_teres_ted parties have applied t?o bu@y one of th]e prop{erti{e{s in So>ut>h Landsham.
T)h)e Pliening comm(u(n(ity sold the first properties in the South Landsham de=velo=pm=ent area o+n t>he o#pen market.
This was reported b=y th%e mayor Roland F?ric?k.
A*nyw*ay t%he applic%a%t%i%on pha{se for each o/f t_h_e 20 properties, which the municipality i[s offering a<t better conditions and pr$i$c$es - similar to the earlier local model, h@a@s now ended.
A`t lea-s-t 100 ap|plicatio|n|s have be+en received, says Frick.
A/t p$re$sent, the documents are being r}eviewed with regard t=o the application criteria, c:om:p:lete:ne:ss a=nd correctness.
According t+o the Mayor o>f P%l%iening, the goal by the end of the year i;s to hav}e the candi=dat=e ranking lis-t for the 20 plo]ts of l=an=d ready for submission t:o th%e local council.
Af\ter that the awarding o,f t#h#e plots can follow.
In the area t;o the south of Landsham a total o"f 50 sin_g_le-_fa_mily and s_emi_-d_e_tache_d properties will be cre?ate?d, including fou:r ar"eas for apartment blocks earm%a%rke%d fo_r e#igh#t residential units.
T.he de@vel@o@pment is practically c?omp?l?et?ed, only the stre(ets and pathways n,o,w need to b|e asphalted.
A sin_gle plot and t/w/o for apar,tment build}in}gs belong to a private indi/vidu/al, t"he rest to the municipality o;f Pliening.
Th/e municipality sells th,e bulk o*f the plots on the op+en market, 20 plots a]ccordin]g to th!e socially r^esp^onsible model.
The two multi-family h|ouse|s of the borough are to b=e b`ui`lt ac-cording t|o Frick as affordable h'o'us'in'g.
With a total o&f 16 inco{me{-or{i{ented f/lats s(u(bs(idise(d by the Free State.

Roughly estimated, there wil\l be space f>or about 2*00 pe`ople within the pr^op^er^ties of the developing ar>ea of La;nd;sham-S;üd.
Not only t=h=is: At the start of October, F@rick s?ay?s th+e new co>n>struc>t>ion o`f a daycare c{en{te{r will begin.

This wa%y, Schalke p~l~ayer Naldo is also a g$reat a@thlet@e on th,e bench
N!ot i\n the starting lineup for the third ti=me in a row: Nev'ert'he'l'ess, Naldo thanks Schalke coac`h D(o(me(nico Tede/sc/o.
G\e\l\s\en\k\irchen - Af:te:r Ronaldo Apare/cido Rodrigues h<a<s not been i\n the Sch[a[lke starting lin)e-up for the th!ir!d time in a row, many people would h!ave understood it if t`he almost two-meters-tall Brazilian player h(ad got hi's fr\us\tra\ti\on off his chest.
B_ut when the Schalke p_layers gathered a>fter th!e 1-0 w_in o%ve%r F)SV Mainz 05 in the center circle as usual a`n`d head c#oa#ch Domenico Tedesco thanke|d a<l<l h\is pl~a~yers, t(he 36-year-old nicknamed Naldo stepped in and s:ai:d; "We have to thank, coach!"
Th~at was very em|o|t|i|ona|l, he is such a great s|po|r|t, Tedesco s>aid la$te$r about t@he reac]tion of his vic!e-!captain, w"ho holds no grudge de)spi)t)e his seat on the bench.
Naldo, who w=a=s a'wa'r'd'ed best Schalke player last season, proba!bl!y knows that he i"s ac?t?ual?ly no"t go)in)g to be stu%c%k o}n the be*nch - he does have a good reason for this b$reak.
A r*e*a*so*n calle{d “ load co-n-trol . ”
I~t w\as not easy to tell h[im
It w=a=s not e<asy to tell him that, I t)ell yo*u, Tedes}co said when he told Naldo that h*e w>as not in th(e starting li)ne)u)p.
H&e i#s an im>p>o>rtant player . He is an im@p@o@rtant person.
But it ’ s alwa*y*s about the thing, it ’ s about the c!lub, ” sai;d T^ede^sco a~s he just,ifie,s th"e st.e.p.
Naldo pl!a!ye!d 90 mi?nutes against Bayern a`nd Porto.
He is 3$6 year@s old.
I%t is important that everyone can catch the?ir breath a&t the m;o;m;en;t.
And that we keep every"one to;g;et;he;r, said Tedesco exp"l"a"ining the rotation, w~hi~ch h?as recently h`i`t Naldo.
An,d to wh]i]ch t'h'e Brazilian reacted wisely: b)y proving himself as a model team playe{r on th;e bench.
