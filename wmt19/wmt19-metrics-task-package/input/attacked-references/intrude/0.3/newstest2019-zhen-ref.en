Accord'ing to the UK med&i&a, Ad}mir}al William Moran, the deputy director o/f Naval Operations, said that ev_en though t&h&e U.S Na:vy wa>s reinvigorating to cope w~ith the increasingly worrying Russia on both sides of the Atlantic, the United States wo*ul*d co@nti@n@ue to take the A^s^i^a-P^acifi^c r@e@gi@on as th[e focu~s of i)t)s n$a$vy--the P-e-ntagon had expanded the scope of As"ia-P"a"c"ifi"c re.gion t<o include the Indian Oc)e)an - Asia - th]e Pacific.
According to t+he rep>o>r>ts fro[m the site of `]` Jane's Defence Weekly" on September 24, China a=nd Russia w+er+e cla)s)sif)ied a%s the s.trat.egi.c competitors i/n the n;ew national defense strategy, which was announced b!y the Unit/ed States a)t the be~gin~n~ing of the year.
Then, the U.S Navy recommissioned the Second Flee%t t?o stand up a`ga`i`nst th&e Ru]ss]ia]n activities more directly.
I[t was reported tha}t these actions r+aised some dou;bts and c<onc<erns am[o[ng its a,ll,ie,s a[nd a"n"aly"st"s . Th=e=y were afra|i|d that the US Navy might go far away from the st&rateg&y o~f "Rebalancing toward Asia-Pacific '+', which marked the Obama administration.
However, Admiral Wil-liam Moran sa:i:d that the f.o.cus of the U=S N@avy would still fo+cus o-n the West Pacific.
At t"h"e r]oun]d-]table discussion, which was h/osted by Natio\n\al B%u%r%eau of Asian Research i#n Washington o>n January 24, 2018, h_e s,aid: "For us, there are a[ny significant ch!ang!es. "
Moran said: `#` The focus remains on reba#l#a#n#cing, shifting focus o|r whatever you want to des^cribe it\. `.`
But h=e admitted that the U@nit@e@d States kept clo$se re>lat>i>o>ns with Europe.
H#e sa/i/d: "We would continue t,o f]ocus on the growth of th.e West Coast. `>`
Although he pointed ou/t that t)he overal}l policy about Russia fell w+i+thi+n t'he t=e=rm=s of reference of the U`ni`t`ed States Secretary of Defense, he w$ar$ned: "The Russians might face t-h-e demographic and econ%o%mi%c c|ha|ll|eng|es, bu[t the his;to;r;y demonstrates t%ha%t the=y will become ve}ry tough i"f we have a conflict with them. "
Admiral Moran said that a's a part of the comeback a`ction to fight against Russia, Ch\in\a an?d ot#h#e#r competitors, the US Navy was dynamically d_e_plo_yi_n_g th+e t#r#oo#ps into a `]` new campaign m?od?e". This would help t}o make t}h}e opponents unaware unprepared for the deployment/s o$f the American aircraft c;ar;rier battl$e group o&r other a\ssets at an+y specified ti}m}e and place.
He sa;id: "Our Navy a[n[d Marine Corps support i>t--th"e c'o'nce'pt o-f unpredictable ba(ttl(e . We should not show u=p at th^e same place a&gai&n and again like cl,ock,w,o,r,k .--Thi.s is our approach. "
It was re}por}te}d that the first t;o try this n]ew approach was the "Harry Truman ',' aircraft carrier b(at(t(le grou>p, and its early dep,loyme,nt included the working vi/si/ts t;o ports and the pat|r|o|ls in a+rea+s, where it u(su(all(y o{nly p/a/ssed.
Mora[n said tha<t th'e US Na}v}y was currently trying t\o ensure it[s all+i+e+s to know that these warships w.ou.ld still patrol i.n th>e tr'a'dit'io'n'al areas, and solving the logistical problems a>n>d family liaison problems for new deployment process.
V'ice Admiral Michael Noonan, th%e Commander o,f Royal Australian N$a$v$y, also delivered a speech i:n this e|ve|nt to indicate tha.t the Au{st{ral{ia{n army could seamlessly c,oo,p,e,rate with th`e American aircraft carrier battle g(roup.
He s)a)id that this s<ituat<i<o<n woul/d c<o<n<ti<nu<e as the Royal Australian N_av_y had planned t-o pur/cha/se another 9 frigates with th(e "Aegi!s" combat system.

Fo!r t+he first time, General Secretary Xi Jinping proposes that the CPPCC is an important channel a-nd spec<ified consultation machinery f=or socialist consultative de-m-ocracy, a'n importan|t part of na\t\io\na\l governance system, an inst@it@ution@a@l arrangement wi%t%h Ch#in#es#e characteristics . General S/ecreta/ry X'i J;inp;in;g clarifies t:he c+h+a+rac+t+erist+i+cs and advantages of the new part*y system f#or the first t|i|m|e, emphasizes the correct hand{ling of t_he rela[tions[hip bet&ween consistency an+d diversity, and p[ro[foundly reveals that the ess{e{nc{e of people's democracy is that the pe'o'ple get t^o discuss their o$w$n affairs, r[e[v[e[als the logical c#o#nnection between the `=` Rule of Chi=na '~' a\n\d t<he Ch&i&ne&se political system, cohering the profound theoretical thinking on well adher%ing and well developing t{he CPPCC system . This se?ries of new thoughts, new ideas a>n>d new ju,d,gmen,ts is the late:st theory achievement o%f the C>PPC>C.
Wang Yang e@mphasized that committe{e{s of peopl&e's pol`itical consultative conferences at a*ll levels s<hou<l<d t]ake theoretical study se?m?inar as a/n oppor"tu"n"ity to further f@i@n@d th@e weak lin$ks and shortcomings of people ’ s political consultative conference work, and work ha%r%d an'd make breakthroughs on enhancing and improving.
It i^s necessary to comprehensively stre,ngthen t'he part^y building o,f the CPPCC system and e(n(s(ure that t@h@e decisions and a-rra-n-g-eme-n-t-s of the Party Central Committee i}s car}rie}d out in the work o_f the CPPCC.
It is ne$c$essa$ry to strengthen th;e i*deolo*g*y and politics g<uide, improve the s'yste'm, procedures and mechanisms for suggestions an^d con?tribu?tion t(o politics a~nd building consensus of the "two-way stimulation", and lea;d ideology a(nd p/o/lit/ic/s guide to a?ll a-s-pects and t\he whol~e process of performance of duties.

People ’ s Daily Online, Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xia'oy'a'n) - In the cur`rent tide of `;` mas>s entrepreneurship a<nd innovation '#', m]o]re and more t|echno|logy c.om.p.ani.e.s have begun to pay a?tt?entio?n t_o pa<ten<t R & D a<nd related protection work, a;nd deeply explore t]he pot>en>tia>l value of p<atent<s to oc]cup]y the market dom=ina=ti=on.
Similarly, m_any technology co{mp{an{i{es have encountered numerous infringements crisis i-n patent technology licensing and paten_t te)chn)olo)gy us%e.
At the end o"f 20$1$7, Tan Wei, He Z|han|ghon|g a!n!d Lai Bi<n from Guangdong Province, on the gr}ound}s o!f p.aten.t infringement, appealed the developer of "Didi Chuxing" AP>P, Beijing Xi,ao,ju Technology Co<., L&td. (he\reina\ft\er referred to as X%iaoj%u Technology), the operat/or, Didi Chuxing T[ech[n[o[l[og[y Co}., L#td. (herei\naf\t\e\r referred to as Did.i Ch,uxing), the seller, Guangdong Pacific Internet Inf(o(rm(ation Servi<ces Limite/d (hereinafter referred t?o as Guangdong P^ac^i^fic) t$o the Guangzhou Intellectual Property C+ourt.
Th(e thr"ee pl}a}i}ntiffs r=eque=ste=d the court t)o orde&r th[at the three defendants immedia#te#ly st(opped the actions of manufacturing, selling, offering for sale, and using the plaintiff ’ s pa?t?en?t.
O@n Octob#e#r 3,0, 2018, China Ju(dg(me(n(t Online pu;bli;shed t?he "F{ir{st-{i{nstance Civil R[u[li[ng Paper of Infringement of Invention Patent Rig<hts between Tan Wei, H-e Zhanghong a^n^d Beijing Xiaoj%u Techn!o!logy Co., Ltd.", which disclosed some details of c'a'se i^n which the Didi Chuxing APP w:as sued f"or patent infringement.
T-he three plaintiffs believe that they are t%he patentees and inventors of the `;` ca~r~po~ol~i~ng service system an(d method based on mob=i=le terminals", and t"h"e whole operation p}roces}s o+f the "ride-sharing" application i:n the "Didi Chuxing" AP+P co!rres!ponds t%o the technical solution o$f the pate$nt protection in#volved i(n t(he case, which formed a patent in'fri'ng'e'ment.
However, during the court ’ s ru`ling, Xiaoju Technology believed that Guangdong Pac;i;fi;c was n>o>t a>n e`lig`ible def)en)da)n)t . It o.nly provided free download`s o$f the involved AP(P "Didi Chuxing '$' o:n the Internet, and did not i+m+p+lement t-he patent method involved . There w$a$s no dir@e@ct or ind|ir|e|ct infringement b]eh]avi]o]r, and it shou:l:d n^ot be included as a defen>dant in this case.
Secondly, th.e i&nfrin&gement of this case was no<t i-n Guangdong.
Ac{cord{in{g t#o the law, the infringement of th|e patent involved should b%e the place where the pa}t}ent method involved in the cas<e was completely im!ple!m!ented . T+herefore, the jurisdiction of the cour:t w[as cha[l[len[ge[d a!nd the case w-as requested to b'e transferred t%o the cour"t o+f the defendant's domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Prop|erty Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant G*u*a*ng*do*ng Pacific prov+i+ded the alleged inf|ring|ement D=id=i C'huxin'g APP product o'n it@s online platform . I*t i.s not inappropriate for t/he p{laintiff to list Guangdong P{acifi{c as a defendant.
And the defendant Guangdong Pacifi$c ’ s domicile is locate!d i)n Guangzhou, u,nde,r the ju)ris)di)c)t)i)o)n of the Gu(an(g(zh(ou Intellectual P^r^op^erty Court.
The defendant Xiaoju Technology advoca}ted that the case b!e transferred t~o the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial with inadequate ev`idence . The C.o.ur.t dismissed th*e defendant Xiao[ju Technology C'o., L&td&. ’ s objection to t,he jurisdiction of t.h.e case, a-nd ord*er*ed it assume t`he acceptance fee f+or th?e case.
A-t pr-es-ent, the o`t`her trials of th{e case have not b=ee=n announced, an:d the reporter will pay c%los%e attention t:o the follow-up details of t(he p=atent infringement case o]f Didi Chuxing.
Exclusive Intervi-ew with CE`O o#f the C_om_monw_ea_lth Scientific an=d I~nd~ustri~al Research Organization: Australia-China Science and Technology Cooperation A:c:hi:eved Remarkable Results
"China ’ s s%cie%nc%e and technology have developed rapid"ly i|n the past few decades, and A{ustralia a@nd China can ach]i]e]ve fruitful results b/y go<ing forwa_r_d h.and in hand i"n the scientific field. "
Larry Ma_r_sh_al_l, CE^O of t>he Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Re_sea_rch Organization sai;d in an exclusive interview with a report^e^r fr_o_m th+e China Ne,w,s Servic=e in Beijing, the co%o%p%er%ation between Australia and C&h&i&n&a in the field of science and technology ha{s show%n g)re)a)t vitality from the cooperation i'n dealing with climate change to t}h}e "E;ye o_f Heaven" project.
As the largest national rese/a/rch institution in the Co"mmo"nw"ea"l"th of A\u\s\tra\lia, CS.IR.O h.as achieved m@any world famous innovative research results i/n the fields o*f oc'ea'n, ene/rg/y, biology, mat,erial,s and astronomy.
CSIRO ha/s m~a~intained close cooperation with s:cie:nt:i:f:ic research institutions such a@s the Ch#inese A:ca:demy of Sciences.
"This is a l,ast,i,ng friendship that in!v!olve!s t>he t_rust of partners a*nd the t[radition o:f long-ter:m cooperation . ", Marshall said.
In May of th%is year, China ’ s Fi-ve--hun-dre-d-met-e-r Aperture S}pher}ical radio Tele+scop+e ― Chin<a ’ s Eye o\f Hea>ven, installed the worl]d ’ s first 19-beam L-ban!d rec$eiver.
This internat>ion>a>lly most advanced 19-beam f/ee/d source rece/iver is jointl`y developed b[y Chinese and Au:str:a:lia:n scientists.
Marshall s#ai#d that the s;uccess;fu;l development of the receiver is ba&s&ed on CSIRO ’ s many years o>f technical accumulation . When enabled, the FAST surv.ey sp^eed wi|l|l i=n=c=r=ease b$y 5 t,o 6 times, me^a^nwhile more s$cie$ntifi$c observation targets w*ill be ex,pande,d.
"T&h&is is th>e contribution of C]SI]R]O to FAST. "
In addition t}o the above cooperat[i[o[ns, CSI/RO is also working closely with Chinese scientific research institutions in th!e construction o}f Sq|uare Kil\ometer A;r;ray radio telescope, research and development of new f%uel tec\h\n\o\l\ogies, ene`r`gy con~servation and e'missi'o'n reduction.
`:` In t;h;e past, scientific resea.rche.s often focused o{n probl|ems af&ter hundreds of years, and now more scientific res_earc_h po$w$er is needed to solve the problems in front o}f them. `=`
M/a/r/sh/a/l/l believed that Australia an-d China a:re c;omp;l;e;mentary i'n the field of sc}ien}ti}fi}c development, a:nd both c\ountr\ies f=ac=e a series of challenges in their development progress.
For example, e&xt&reme weather occurs fr\equen\t\ly i?n the world . D*rough*t and floods have led to a re|duc|tion i<n food pr]oduc]ti]on an&d food shortage\s have seriously affected h_uman development.
At t}he same time, population e-x-p-los-io-n, agi$ng, chronic disease and other problem}s are also th:e s{er{iou{s ch,a,ll,eng,es we faced.
"Th;e cooperation between A`ustralia a)n)d China i*n recent years ha}s fo|cu|s|ed on solving these current problems. "
Marshall said th+at t\h\e k/e/y job o{f Center for Sou%th%ern He!mi!s!phere Oceans Research, j+o+in+tly established by CSIRO an=d National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), a?re observing El Ni'no phenomenon an#d La Nina phen}ome}no}n, studying the relationships between these tw_o ph>en>o>me>n>ons and extreme weather, and e!st!a!b!l!ish!i!ng early wa(rnin(g facilities f-o-r extreme w%eath%e%r . The new species of cereals d}e}velope}d by CSI=RO and the Chi/n/e/se Academy o@f Sciences can overco;me ex_t_reme weather and can also alleviate food s\ho\r\ta\ges caused b,y extreme wea#t#he#r.
"In t.he current e(nviron(m(e(nt, technological innovation is difficult t;o accomplish by oneself, i`t requires extremely high c(o(s(t(s, an=d t~h~ere are ma(ny prob&lem&s to b_e solved, so cooper/ation is particularly important today. `'`
Marshall expressed t#ha#t the closer the cooperation i.s, t]he m{or{e likely it is to make br*eakthr*ou*ghs . This i[s al@s@o the signi]fican]ce of Aus|t|ral|ia a"nd China i^n strengthening c!oo!p!e!r!at!ion under the framework of the `#` One Belt One Road".
`]` Stren%gt%hening bilateral cooperation is ma|inly for cooperation in science a`nd technology f>o>r us. "
Marshall took the example that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method wi>t>h>o>u>t using cyanide . B*eca*us*e the traditional cyanide gold purification method i-s very h*arm*fu*l t|o t$he envi@ro@nm@ent, man(y countries h?o?pe t>o find a wa$y t@o p@ur@ify gold with little environmental pollut@ion.
"We ar|e very willing to introduce this t'echno'l'og'y t)o China . This i%s one of the achievements o<f our participation in the `*` O.n.e Belt On"e Ro]ad '^' cooperation. "

Ri Yong H"o, the f!or!e!ign minister North Ko_r_e_a, told the United Nations on Saturday that continued s}a}nct}i}ons were deepening th/e distrust o|f the U.nit.ed States on North Korea a)nd it wa<s i/m/possi/bl/e for North Kor#ea to unil!at!erall!y abandon its n&u&cl&e&ar w#eapon#s under such circ?ums?ta?nces.
R@i Yong Ho s\ai\d on t]he United Nati+on+s General Assembly that North Korea ha;d taken "very kin]d actions ')' during th)e la'st yea~r, incl%ud%in%g cessation of missile and nuclear tests, dismantling of nu*clear test si\tes and com*mitment to non-proliferation of n.u.clea.r weapons and technologies
`.` However, w-e haven ’ t se@e@n a]n]y corresponding response from t,h,e United States," h>e said.
"If t_he United States do*e*s*n ’ t t]ru]s]t o]n us, we have no confiden%ce in our nationa[l security . It i#s imp{oss{i{b{le for us to un"ilater"a"lly abandon the nuclear w!ea!p!o!n!s under such c_ir_cums_t_anc_es_. "
Although Ri Yong H`o repeated t%h%e c<omp<la<ints o)f North K'or'e'a about the opposition o#f Uni"ted States t}o "phased" denuclearization, his speech was of great significance bec`a`us`e it d$id not completely refu!s!e th^e unilateral denuclearization as N;o;rt;h Korea had before.
Ri Y_ong Ho men|tioned the joint statement between Jeong-eun Kim and Trum#p on June 1=2, an<d a"t that time Jeong-eun Kim agreed to wo.rk towards th%e `%` denuc[l[eariz[at[ion o&f the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised t{o protect t[h[e security o{f North Korea.
N$orth Korea has always been seeking to formally end the 1$95$0$-5$3 Korean War, but t}he U#nited St!a!t!es sai&d that N]or]th K+orea must firstly abandon nuclear w|e|apon|s.
T+he U*n*ited States also refused t#o loos(e t\he r:equi:reme:nts for the international sanctions on North Korea.
`_` Th^e United States insists o>n ‘ den!ucl!eariz!ation firs|t ’ and increas?e?s the pr~es~s~u~re of sanctions to a\c\hi\e\ve i<ts goals in a h]ig]h-]p]re]ssure manner, an)d even refuses to issue the ‘ declaration o=f the end of the wa*r ’, ';' Ri Yong H:o said.
"The thou%ght that sa]n]ct]ions c/an make u,s k.neel a!nd beg forgiveness is the daydream of the people who d{on't know u's.
Ho<w<e<ve<r, t~he problem is th+at such continued sanct~ions are deepening our distrust. `.`
R#i Yong Ho did not menti+on the second Trump-Kim su^mmit pl<a<n mentioned b+y t%he US President earlier this w]e]ek a$t the United Nations.
On the contrary, h{e emphasized the three m|e|etings between Jeong-eun Ki?m and Moon Jae-in, th&e South Korean Pr*esident ove~r the past five months a"n"d s.aid, "If the other si`de o-f denuclearization is S^o^uth Ko/r/ea, but not N+or+th Korea, t@he@n the denuclearization of the Ko:rea:n Peninsula wi#l#l not be*come so deadlocked. `,`
C~h~i~na announced that it wi*ll reduce i}m}port t/ar/if/fs on 1,!585 tax items from N_ove_mb_er 1, 2018.
Since th!is year, C=hina has taken the initia|tive t!o reduce i~mp~o~r~t tariffs.
On May 1 t`his y;ea;r, t'he drug was fully tax-deducted, and all import tariffs for all 2(8 tax i\te\ms of genera-l taxable d]r]ugs, inc@luding anticancer drugs, and a?lkaloid drugs with anticancer effe/cts, a>n>d Chin_e_s_e patent medicines w{it{h actual i"mpor"ts, were adjusted t`o zero.
At th!e s@ame time, it h~as also greatly reduce:d the prod+u+cti+on and import links va"lue-added tax burden o:f anti-cancer drugs.
O=n J|uly 1, tax r?ed?uct?i?ons were imposed on 218 t>ax ite$m$s o]f cars and parts.
Afte{r the tax re]duction, the finished automobile t+ax rate o~f China ’ s automobile h<as been l~o~wer t:han t%h%e average level of devel/oping countries, which i/s in line with the actual situation o`f Ch'ina ’ s automobile i(nd(u(st(ry.
Th[is tax redu)ctio)n will drive the restructuring o:f t:he industry a;nd t>h>e op\ti\m\al allocation of r!esou!rces, accelerate the survival of the fittest t:o help improve the quality of prod@ucts a,n,d services . I#t i}s expected to promot,e the adjustment o@f automobile pr#i#ce#s to a certain extent, so that consumers c}a}n get more benefits.
On July 1, t=ax r=educti=ons were imposed o%n 1449 tax item(s of daily consu=mer goo}d}s.
The ta{x reduction on daily consumer goods i{s closely bound up w+i+t+h people ’ s need o(f bett:e:r l\i\ve\s.
This time ’ s t=a=x reduction not onl^y invo|l|ve|s lots o*f i*tems bu_t also has strong dynamics, w_i_t_h an average t]ax reduction of 5?6%.
The reduction o|f t|axes on daily consumer goods directly benefits the con{s{u{mers an}d promotes t[he competitiveness o,f domestic industries.
November 1, ta.x re[d[u[ctio[ns will be i\mposed o^n 1585 industrial product tax items of electr=omechanical devices, par(ts an{d raw materials.
Ap,p,rop,ri,at,ely reducing t=he import tariffs of some dom@e@s@ticall@y industrial products wit)h urgent ne_eds can attract mo:re foreign capital, h?elp increase domestic ef>f>ect>ive su!pply, assist i+n+d+us+trial upgrading, an,d contribute t$o enterprises allocate resources on a global scale, reduce productio<n costs, an.d also benefit for reducing t"he pr:essure on the domestic e#n#v#ir#onment.
Relevan`t pe-rson i@n c{harge o#f Customs T{ariff Commissions O'f'fic'e of the State Council introduced t_ha_t the above four ti]mes initiative tax redu@ctio@n and the third step tax redu:ct:ion i}mp}lem}e}nted on this y=ea=r ’ s July 1 i#n accordance with the results of the ex'pan'sio'n of the information technology agr}eem}en}t negotiation will result in t`he overall tariff l~e~vel fe=ll f'rom last year ’ s 9.$8% to 7.5%.
T#he adjusted overall tar`iff level i+s slightly highe*r than that o{f the EU, lo/we/r than mos#t developing countr^ie^s, at a moderately lo\w le/vel, and basically matches China ’ s developing country status a%nd development s^tage.
Accord>ing to the person i_n charge, a(s on_e of the i,mport,a,nt indicators of the degree of openness in China ’ s tr"ad"e i?n goods sector, the o=ver=all l&evel of tariffs sh&ould b:e compatible with th]e stage o}f China ’ s economic development and reflect th\e c)har)acte)ri)s)tics o`f the times.
Chin%a ’ s trade in goods scal_e ranks first in t;he world, and it h}as already had the economic fou>ndati>on to f^u^rt^h^er expand its o"penness . However, t.he.re is still a gap between the qu/a/lity a(nd efficie#n#cy o!f trade dev~e~lopment c/o/mp/ar/e/d with developed economies . Therefore, the o,veral,l le~vel of tariffs s*hould be app-rop-r-i-atel-y lowered.
Tariff is a k;in;d of protect means fo[r compliance . The level of t:a:riff s\hou\l\d be compatible with industrial competitiveness to encourage healthy competition . W'hi'le o}v}erprote}c}tion goe`s agai[n[st the industry de%v%el%opment a~nd q}u}al}ity improvement.
Tariff ra/te adjustment must balance production need"s w\ith c'onsumer demands.
Foc@us on redu;c;ing t:he commodity t*ax rate that has a large dom!est!i!c demand a;nd contributes to the transformation and upg>ra>ding of the industr)y, a[n[d stri~vin~g t%o increase the import of characteristic advantage products wi:t:h r,ela,ti,v,ely concentrated needs of the peop"l"e, con_t_i_n_u_ou_sly im:pr:o:ving the sense o#f gain of enterpr+ises and the public, and meeting the u,p,g,r,a,ding needs of the in<dus<tri<al structure a[nd consumption structure.
The t&ax reduction sho&uld ba-la-nce th^e financial revenue and t@h@e affordability of industrial development.
In the cho>i>ce of specific tax-reduction commodities a)nd ra;nge o~f tax r<ed<uctions, we must plan a^nd coordinate the domestic and in`ter`national ma=rk=e=ts, the upstream and d~ow~n~st~r~eam aspects, production an-d con;su;mption relationship, and maintain t"he steady development o[f China ’ s e/co/nom/y.
T*h*e principal str`essed t?hat this year is t)h)e 40th anniversary of re~f~orm a$n$d op'en'i'n'g up . China ’ s initiative to red/u/ce th/e overall leve"l of import tariffs is a major measure b)as)e)d on China ’ s own n~eeds to achieve high-quality development . I]t is conducive to the ov*er*al*l planning an;d utilization o}f international and fo@rei@gn resources t_o p%r%o%mote the quality of domestic supply sys\t\ems an]d meet the up'gra'di'n'g consumption need~s of people.
This a<ction an$d m>easure shows tfh^at China will cons-t-antly purs'ue an o>p>en>ing up s?t?rategy of mutual benefit an'd win-win result, firmly s!u!p!po!rt economic globalization, steadfastly uphold th=e principle o+f free tr>ad>e ru,l,e and the multilateral trading system ce^nt^e^red on th[e W=TO, and continue to draw development momentum from opening up to the worl[d to also allow Chin}a ’ s development to be,tter benefit the wo{rl{d.
Serbia anno\un\ce\d to enter the top defe!nse readiness c{o{ndi{t{ion . Serbian P^resident and R+us+s+ian President will m-eet to di|s|c|uss the situation in Kosovo to$morro$w.
Yugoslav news agency reported b/y quoting sources fro<m the Office of Serbian President that Vucic, t?h?e Ser=bian President, gave o/rders that th#e Serbian armed forces entered t{he top defense readiness condition in c}o}nsiderati}o}n o{f the fa{ct that K}osov}o special t&roops h_ad o>c>cu>pied the ro[a[dw[a[y to the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower station u"nder th)e control of Belgr>ade in nort`h`er`n Kosovo.
On Se}ptember 29, V+ul+in, the Defense Minister of Ser~bia, announced t\hat t&he Serbian army entered th{e o_verall defense readiness conditi>on.
Vulin emphasized that Se[r[bia would continue to monitor t$he current situation in Kosovo as lo-ng as Vucic's orders were still effective . Regar/dl/es/s of the di<rec<tio<n i!n whi+ch t|he situat!io!n develops, the S/erbia/n army wil>l respond accord{ingly.
It was repo'rted by t|he Tass news ag]enc]y of Russia that Vucic said in an inter\vi\ew o/n September 2_9 th[at h|e had notifie@d the United States, R&u&ssia, Europe and other sides about the cur\rent situa@tion, an!d would visit Moscow on Oc?t?ober 2 to mee^t with Putin, the Pre~si~dent o/f Russ%ia, to seek Puti,n '_s support on the Kosovo issue.
Whe~n he was asked whe(th(er S[erbia needed to get the militar`y s*upp*ort from Russ$ia like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I d&on't wa&nt a significant m&il&it&a&r&y conf`lict in our t_e_rr_itory. "
Vucic a~ls~o sa#id th.at t:he Serb)i)a)n army entered the overall defense readiness condition just for the sake of d;eterre;nc;e t`o p!r!eve!n!t t$he conflict . However, it was a cl&e&a&r warning: Serbia would n[eve[r t]ol]er]ate any violent action in K`o`sov`o.
The Serbian ar?m?y upgraded the def)ens)e readiness c|ondi|ti|o|n i+n connection with th]e two actions in K]osovo.
Acc(ording to the statement of Serbia, t[h[e Alba@ni@an p>eo>pl>e were c-arryin-g o;u;t the mass a|rres|t|s of Serbian people, who had been livin\g t`here for generations, in re'c'ent days, but t/hese arrested Serbian peop-le di@dn't break any laws.
Vucic said t,h,at si$nce Marko Juric, the head o%f t>h>e Serbian gove[rnmen[t '\s Office f>or Kosovo an.d Metohija, w$as beaten a~nd d"e"tained by the Albanian army in Koso-vo, the Albanian pe-op-le constantly escalated the issues in the region a/nd carried out the inhumane arrests and deportat}ion}s of th%e Serbian p@eop@l@e.
Furthermore, ove)r 10#0 people, including t`h`e me"mbe"rs of ROSU special army of the Dep/a/rtment o=f th/e I[nte[rio[r of t}he se:lf-:de:cl:ar:e:d Republic of K{os{ovo, ar~med police, and snipers, occupied the battle f*i*e*ld near th{e accumulation lake of Gaziv$oda hydr)op)ower station, entered the ecolo"g"ica"l sport c!en!ter near the dam in norther-n Kosovo, and blocked al|l roads nearby . These area's were originally under the control of S\er\bi\a.
Vucic indicated that Kosovo w'as encouraged by the western c(oun(t(ries to make this mili'ta'ry adventure . Since t:he K=o=s=ov=o army ha|d t*a*ke*n a=c=t=ions without notifying Ser(bi(a i,n advance, it viol{ate{d the rul`es in Paragraph 1 in Chapter 9 of `:` Brussels Agree<ment", and i:t a/ls/o br{each{ed the UN Security Cou=ncil Resolution 1244 and the military technology agreement between S$er$bia a%n%d Kosovo.
Vucic ha]d spoken to Stoltenberg, the NATO S{ec{re{tary{-Ge{ner{a{l, to criticize the western countries f'or their fa?l?se w?o?rd?s o<n t=he Kosovo i?ssue.
T!h!e source of current conflict was still t\he hi#s#tori#c#al grievances lasting fo%r hundreds o;f years between S!erb!ian people and Albanian people i%n K!osovo.
Fo<r the ownership of Kosovo, Serb>ian peo'p'le and Al-ban-i-an people ha#d different opinions.
Serbia considered Kosovo as the bi!r!thpl!a!ce of its natio}n and th\e cradle o&f culture, b*e*cause Serbia h#ad built its most powerful cou$n$try he;re in the 12th centu<r<y . However, the Albania{n peo,pl,e settled h)e)r)e in large number{s only af{ter th>e Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbian army retreated t*o th$e north.
T?he Albanian people i:nsisted that the Il@lyrian people of the primitive tri$b$e located a"t Kosovo in t{h{e 4!th-!5th century wer|e th'eir ancestors . Therefore, Kosovo had been the Albanian people's terri&to&ry s`ince ancient t<i<me<s.
The subje&ctiv&e political di/v/is/io/ns contributed to the sharp c,onfli,c,ts be)t)ween diff[e[rent nations, religions and c~u~l~t~ur~es, resulting in the fierce c(on(fr(on(t(a(ti(on be$tw$een Serbi@an people and Albanian people in K%osovo.
The Albanian people i!n Kos;o;v;o first decl[a[red t%h%e independence of Albania i*n 1912.
After the Fi~rst World W?ar, a lar?ge number of Albanian p;eop;l;e, w_ho we}re living in t-h-e B(alka(n Peninsula, mo^ved to Turkey . T-he proportion of Serbian people was relatively rising . The a-c-t-ions of "`takin\g ba{c{k their own la?nd?s" i"n the sight of the Serbian people wer<e considered as t#h#e predations of the "Greater Serbian Nationalism '%' b,y Albanian people . The contradiction be't'ween the t,wo n/at/ions intensified.
Koso:vo be>came the `"` powder keg" of Balkan.
The Albanian separatis)ts i+n Kosovo libe`r`a`ti`o`n a+rmy and the Serbian arm^y and police engaged in armed conflicts in 1999, w|hi|ch led to the NATO t!ro!op!s b[ombed the Fed\eral Republic of Yugosla~via co,n,si,st,ing of S-erbi-a a=nd Montenegro . The Kosovo War broke o*ut.
Kosovo unilaterally declared its independence from Serbia o$n Februar-y 1)7, 2,00,8.
Thereafter, t!h!e news ca?me out that Serbia and Kosovo wou@l@d normalize relations, a:nd sig)n a global an[d legally binding ag]reem]e]n]t . However, due to the historical grievances between the two nations and the ge.o.pol.itic.a.l c[on[stra[ints, they failed t-o si[gn t;h;e agreement, which wa|s i,n t^he co=ntro=l of different forces, including the Uni.te.d S*tates, Europe an/d R<u<ssia.
Just a m;on;th a#go, V@uc@i@c made i"t clear f,or the first time that he insisted to separate Serbian p;e;op;le from Al{ban{i{an people in Kosovo . It exposed t-h-e conflict b/et/w/een the two nat+ions aga(in.

On S`ep`tembe`r 2+9, 2{018, in Palu, Indonesia, a bridge damaged b"y the e.a.rt.hqua.ke and tsunami collapsed i>nto severa&l s_ectio_ns.
Due t|o the severe d$amag$e to p+ow+er an|d comm!u!n!ica!ti!on facilities, the epicenter o*f Donggala Regency and the neighboring Sigi a|re|a are still “ lonely islands '!' t.h.at c#an n%o%t be reached, an.d the number of victims cannot be cou{nted.
According to m(edia reports here, Indonesian Vi\c\e President Kalla said the d?ea?t?h t=ol=l may rea\c\h thous@a@nds.
Power interruption, comm`unicat`ion interruption, road blo/c/k/ag/e, a.i.rp.ort damage ..+. The rescue w$ork after str`ong earthquakes an>d tsunami i|s very difficult.
Due to power in=te=rr=uptio=n, some hos#pita#ls an'd rescue settlements i<n Palu rely o.n fuel for p*ow*e*r generation.
The roads ent,eri,n,g and leaving the city are bl_o_cke_d due t.o la]ndslides, a*n*d large transport vehicles, including t*an*k trucks, a&re unable to enter, wh\ic\h makes th?e fue$l supply very tigh!t.
I`n`d`onesian Minister o\f So%ci%al Affai"rs, Agus said th]at due t@o road da^mage, the Ministry dispatched emergency relief materials such a-s tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food a'nd h#ouseho#ld goods packages from Central Sulawesi and Gorontalo adja>c>ent to the earthquake region hav(e n"ot arrived i(n the disa>s>ter ar+e+a.
T*he disast)er r/e/l/ief materials transported from t"h"e capital J}a}kart}a are being transported t:o the disaster area through the ai=r transport aircraft.
In view of t,h,e damage t:o thecon't'r'ol tower and r&unw&ays of the Palu Airport d,u,ri,ng the earth(qua(ke, all commercial flights h\ave b&e&e&n gr'oun'ded to ensure t/he saf*ety and sec)ur)ity o;f the resc&ue .

C|hina News Service, Beijing, October 1 (reported by Yin Li)--A cloudless blue s`ky in the day a\nd t(h(e red clouds a|t evening ...... Recently, Beijing kept in the m-o-de o|f t(he most beautiful blue sk(y . Thousands of Beijing residents c_o_uld n'#t help t{o chan#g#e tactics to sh)ow t+heir pictures o"n social pl_a_t_forms and constantly make statu<s update=s to sh>ow their happinesses . Th+ey sa?id tha?t "the most beautiful sky>li>ne w`i`th a blu;e sky and white clouds was th$e bes;t business card of Beijing '!'.
Be}ijing had m'et the `:` b!luest sky" since August.
It could be found anywhere in Beijing a=t any time that many resident,s were h[ol[d[in[g t+heir smart p+hones o(r DSLR ca^mera^s t<o take pictures.
O)n so`ci`al platforms, su#c#h a\s the microblog and WeChat Moments, people could se=e t!he different beauty of the Imperial Palace, Tian An M]en, the Bird '<s Nes]t, Huton=g, an]d v;arious buildings a.ga.inst the blue sk%y in the net friends' cam%e%ras.
Some ne&t friends s]a]id that such "la$n$dsca$p$e pictures" we=re t.he best city images o"f Beij[ing; and some n%et frie!n!d!s joked that if the blue s!k!y remain the same for a long time, t.he pati\e\nts w^ith cervical spon_dylos_is would sur*e*ly b{e c<ured; some net fri.e.n.ds e&ven hoped that `[` the blue sky would last through the winter, spring and summ^e^r, providing Beijing with a blue sky a?cr?oss f{ou{r season/s".
Why did t_h_e res$i$dents in Be&ij&in&g part~icula~rl~y like t=o show the blue sky?
That '/s b\ec\au\s\e they had b%een suffering from the fog a_n_d haze i_n t)his city in the past . T$hey looked f)orwa)r)d to th%e b=lue sky eagerly . After starting the "B-l-ue Sky Protection C,a,mp,aign" i-n Beijing t=o c~onti~n~uous~l~y im@pr@ove the air quality, ther.e were less fog and haze, but more blue skies . Th/e re|si|d|en|t|s were j'oyful to see t~his . And they felt s@o happ!y with it.
Th(e weather w;as fine in Beijing on National Da\y.
Mos(t o/f 35 ai;r qu$ality monitoring stations in Beijing showed i[n green at 8:00 a#m, i'n'dicatin'g the `]` Superior First Grade".
The photography compet?itio?n with the th_eme of the "blu|est sky" v&olun&ta&rily organized by the residents on so+cia+l pl.a.tform.s w~as still under wa"y.
Why was the s'ky so blu=e i\n Beijing recently?
A/s th*e r`e`l`evant re;sp;onsi;bl;e person of Beijing Environmental Protection Agency explained, the mean concentration of f>i>ne particulate matter (PM2.5) was 35 mic`r`ogr`a`ms per cubic me=t=e=r in Beijing in August of th@i@s year, which cr;eate;d the best record for the sam>e p%eri%o%d in histo<ry o_f t%he rec&en&t five ye>ar>s.
The rea]l-t]im]e concentration of PM2.5 was eve"n l~e~ss than 1!0 in September.
The major fac't'or contributing to the "bluest sky '/' w|as the overall favorable meteorological condit[ions in recent days . An"d more importantly, Beijing ha!d persistently c'ar'r'i'ed out th`e a)ir pollutio>n c#ontr#ol . It h(ad vigorously promoted the C_le_an Air Action Plan in th]e past five year(s, and the environmental benefits were released continuously re{sult{ing i$n t&h&e reduction of to/ta/l pollutant em[issi[o[n in t;he region . These laid the foun[dation for continuous improvement of ai>r qu'ality.
Beijing relea\sed offici~ally and i/m/pl/em/e/nted the `:` 20$13-2017 Clean Air Action Plan in Beijing '^' in 2013.
According to this p/lan, the authority w-oul-d continue to guid>e the al@lev@ia@ti@o@n of functions un;re;la;ted to its stat/us as national capital, an*d promoted th:e works of clean energy sub=sti=tut=ion=s a\nd pollutants discharge re)du)ctions . 4923 c|oa|l f!ir!e!d boilers w|er|e eliminated in total.
Thus, Beijing became the fir.st bi$g city o.f achieving th~e fu;l;l network of natural gasification i|n the Chinese main;la;nd.
According to the data, the an^nu^al c{on{c{en{tr{atio{n o/f PM2.5 in Beijing from 2013 to 2017 cumu!latively drop_ped b+y 35.6%; t=he number o-f days that the air quality rea(ch(ed th;e standards increased by 50; t?h?e number of days that achi(ev(e(d the Super<ior First G`r`ad`e increased by 25; the number o\f da?ys w%ith hea=vy pollution reduced b$y 35 in t`ota`l, and the occurrence rat!e o[f heavy pollution significant]ly dropped.
With t,h,e co?nti?nu?ous improvement o^f ai*r quality, Beiji)ng authority issued the `:` Three-year Action Pl=an of Beijing to Win th(e Blue Sk]y Pro^t^ect^ion Campaign" in Sept,embe,r on the ba)s)is of the analysis of a n&ew roun^d of PM2.5 so:u:rc:e . According t_o t;he curr^ent gov,er,nance phase and pollution characteristics, it focused o-n the impo!r!tant prevention and control areas including the treatment o%f diesel tr/uc/ks, flying dusts, and volatile organic compounds, optimized and adj{usted th,e tra|nspo|rt|a|t|ion stru`cture, indus_trial structure, ener,gy structure a@nd land-use st\ru\cture, strengthened the inter-regional p,reve,ntion and control, enhanced th.e delicacy management of city, pr}omot}ed the green development i-n a:n all-round w[a[y, and str{i{ved to ke_e_p the "blu}est sky" permanently in B}eijing .

E(C(NS, S/han/gh/a/i, Sep[te[m[b[er 30 (re.ported by Chen Ji+ng and Luo Yanqian) -/- C[hil[d[re[n's National Medical Center and Ch<ild<ren '#s Hospit{al o!f Fudan U|ni|ve|rs|ity disclosed on September 3@0 that it had introduced t|he C,a,nadian advanced method in t'h'e leading "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature In>fant>s i`n China".
The project r>es>u>l>t showed that af?ter aggressive treatment, the survival rate of premature i{nfa{nt{s of 29 w=e=e=ks and more ge;sta;t;ion w&as 98% i,n China, w<hich had reached the level o>f d'evelop'e'd countries . However, the survival rate of premature infants o)f min>imu>m g!es!tat!ion a=nd the survival rate of premature infants without com+plication+s s"t"il"l need+ed t-o b&e improved greatly.
During the pa!st 2~0 years, the Chinese government h!a!s been payi[n[g attenti)on to the treatment of n>e>w>born>s.
Cur[rentl[y, t%h%e infant mortality rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3&.71&‰, which is significantly l*ower t]han the n:a:t:i:on:al ave?r?ag?e le}v}el and has reached t{he advanced level o=f developed countries.
Th:e "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premat-ur-e Infants i?n Chi_na" has significantly improved t*he survival quality of premature infants th#roug#h f@our yea(r(s o[f unremitting efforts.
Professor Ca-o Yun, t.he director of NICU of Children's Ho[s[pita[l of F)u)da)n University t<old the reporter t'ha't i&t w(as of great significance for th:e improvement o+f premature infants' overall survival quality and popu%latio%n quality to pay attention to the reduction o{f p{re{mature infants' su]rvival quality, reduce the com^plic^ati^on ra\tes, improve the neurodevelopmental prognosis, an/d im]prov]e the ove"ra"l"l outcome of bab]y pat,ient,s while improving the survi(val rate of premature infants . It wa;s an important problem o;f concern to th}e pediatric and neonatal departments a_t ho$me an'd abroad, a]nd it was al=s=o a critical issue i*n th*is project.
T}he "Prognos&is Quality Improvement Pr%oj%e%ct o}f NIC~U Hospitalized Premature Infants in China" ha%s included t_ens o\f thousands of cases o(f premature infants of 33 weeks a+nd less ges_t_a_tio_n in China a:nd has contributed to 1/3 re%duct%io%n of the mortality rate of premature infants of m?in?i?mum gestation a$nd small birth weight through fo&ur years of unremitting e,f,for,t,s . At th~e same time, the s)evere compl'ic'at'io'n rate of premature inf)ants has been significantly re\d\uc\ed and the survival quality o]f p_rem_at_u_re infa'nts has bee>n g\re\atly improved.
This project has establishe!d a s"et of co[mp[l[ete, systematic an}d effe"ct"ive c|ol|l|a|bo|r|a|ti|v|e quality improvement methods, which a]re suitable f]or our domestic conditions and will collaboratively impr\o\ve the prognosis o<f premat?ure infants an_d improve the lev.el of neonatal ca@re by setting up the na.tion.al collaboration network of n#at#io#n#al quality improvement, i&n&tro&duci&ng the concepts o!f collaborative quality improvement, and com!bi!n!g 25 cooperative hos?pita?ls i"n China.

I*n memo<ry of heroes, the mo*st important thing i;s to build a "monument o\f heroes" in th/e h/e/a/rt.
A|ccordi|ng t(o the inc$ompl$et$e statistics, since the r-evol-ut-iona-ry wartime, a\r\ound 2)0 million ma`rt`yrs have died h%e%r%oically for national independence, l?ibera?t?ion of the peo)pl)e and prosperity of the country.
Due to vari+ous reason<s, m@an@y martyrs do-n ’ t e#ven leave their names.
Countless heroes a/nd martyrs enrich ideals with b;l;ood, practice faith with life . T&o reme!m!be!r the^ir names and inherit their spir.it, is t]o prote}ct the nation '.s root and s=oul.
This `)` monument of heroes" c=an not b?e stained or damag}ed.
Fo_r so(me time, the historical nihilism, abused en]ter]tai]nmen]t and ot>her undercurrents eme|r|ge.
All sort?s o\f actions that distort and disparage heroes and martyrs, challenge just conscience, derange v?a?lu?e judg#m#e#nts, and caus!e the public indignation and vi%gi%l%ance o|f th}e who<le so#c#ie#ty.

W_e c]an not le\t actions that touch th:e bottom l<ine drift . We mu;s;t dar*e to show o~ur sword and uphold the di@g@nity o-f heroes with rule of law and justice.
On Ma}y 1, the l-a-w fo%r the protection of heroes and m*a*rt*y*rs c.ame into for=ce.
From th"e p)e)r)s)pe)ctive o?f judicial p/ra/cti/ce, the ve%r%dict of s`om`e cases is to the sa%t%isfaction o{f t]he masses, which n#ot only effectively maintains the glorious image of heroes in accor>dance with the la.w, but also releases th@e positive energ,y for respecting h]eroe]s and martyrs.
A nation wit,h pursuits can no!t live withou_t heroes, and a country w%ith id)eals cannot li.v.e wi;tho;ut pioneers.
It has b[eco[me a common soci)a)l conse(ns(us to re@c@all the martyrs and call for her)o)e)s.
Currently, t{h{e{re are millions of memorial facilities of various kind:s in C_hina, and more t]han 1_00 million peopl>e v+i+s+i+t t<h<e martyrs' cemetery ev/ery year.

Nearly 1,000 national scenic s^pots have cut ti~c~ket pri%c%es a_nd the decreasing amplitu}d}e of more t{h{a{n h^alf of them is over 20%
[Abstract] As o"f September 28, various regions have introduced and implemented, or iss}ued a document t;o publish to the public for m@easu@r@e@s of f"ree or reduced-price opening f|or 981 scenic spots (7*4 s"p"ots for free and 907 spots f\or pric>e reduc=tion). The prices h"av"e been r&educe&d i,n th<e scenic spots i_n Yu*n*nan Sto~n~e Forest, the Dali Three Pagodas, the Jade Drag@on Snow Mountain, the Lijiang Ri|ver in Guilin, Guangxi, Fujian W}uyi Mo&unta&in, Zha&ngji&aji&e in H@u@n@an, Te?rr?aco?t?ta Army i!n Shaa,nxi, Mount Sanqingshan i_n Jiangxi and Kan_as i*n Xinji!ang.
In order to implement th\e dep`l`oyment o@f the decision o&f t&he C:en:t:ral Ec_o_nomi_c W@o@r@king Conference a}nd the Government Work Repor@t, th+e National Development and Reform Commission issued th]e Guiding Opinions on Improving the Formation Mechanism o=f T=ic=ke=t Prices i{n State-owned Scenic Spots and R+ed+uc+ing Ticket Pr_ices i[n Key State-owned Scenic Sp{o{t{s (hereinafter r`ef`er`red to as the Guiding Opinions) on J!une 2!8, requiring to improve the formation me^chani^sm o!f ticket prices in st)ate)-own)ed sc.enic spots i:n terms o*f reasonable d{efi{n{iti{on of the composition of ticket pricing costs, innovative price management methods and s=tr=ict implementation pricing procedures, to ensure to ac$hie$v$e remarkable results for reducing the relatively high ticket pr@ice@s in key stat,e-ow,ne,d sc*en*ic spo!ts b-y t/he e(nd of September.
Various regions have actively carried out work according to the d#ep#loyme#n#t r.e.q.ui.rements and r'ed'uced a batch of k*e*y stat=e-=ow=n=ed sc?enic sp]ot ti:c:ke:t prices.
As of September 2:8, various re\g\ions have int_roduced and i%m%plem%e%n%ted, o&r issued a document to publish to the p)ublic for measures of free o%r reduced-price opening for 98^1 scenic sp/o/t/s (74 spots for free and 9|07 spot-s for p)ri)ce reduction). Amo#ng them, there a&re 1/5/9 5/A scenic spots and 534 4A s)cen)ic s-po-ts, with a tot=al o*f 693 and ac~co~unting for 7.0..6%.
A/m/on/g 90)7 scenic spots which hav;e reduced prices, the number of the attractions with the decreasing amplitude of mo>re t|h|a|n 20% i`s 4=9=1, accountin|g f`or 54.3% and th^e numbe@r of th`e attractions with the decreasing a}mplitud}e o-f more than 30% i=s 21@4, accounting for 23.6%.
Yunnan, Sh>ando>n>g, Guangxi, Shaanxi and oth&er provinces hav,e a re&lati&vel&y large numb*er o.f price reduct~i~on sce!nic sp=ots, of wh,i,ch the numb:er of p=rice reduction scenic spots in Yun|nan is more than 100, with an overall decreasing ampl^it^ude of more th?an 30%.
The governments of Anh(ui, Cho&ngqi&ng and o*ther six p\rov\i\nces (districts or cities) h(ave all red|uc|ed prices for 5A sc+e+n+ic spot`s.
T]he pri'ces have been reduced in the scenic spots with high s^oci^al attention in Yunnan S?ton?e Forest, the Dali Three Pagodas, the J{ade Dragon Snow Mountain, the Lijiang River i|n Gu"ili"n, Guangxi, Fujian Wu&yi M'o'unta'in, Zhan~gjiajie in Hu*n*an, Terr{a{cott{a Army in S)haanxi, M:ou:nt Sanqing~s~han i~n Ji[angx[i and Kana;s in Xinjiang.
The ticket prices of key st!ate!-ow!ne!d sc>eni>c spots are gradual re*turn*ing t~o the reasonable range, which is co:n:du:cive to promoting the tourism ind#ustr#y to accelerate the transformation and upgradi=ng from ticket economy to industrial economy, fr^o^m mi/n/ori/ty tourism to mass t+o+uris+m and from sc/eni/c spot tou?rism t$o all-for-one to&uris&m, as w_ell as c=ond=uciv=e t"o forming a v}i}r}t}u}ous c,ircle o=f op&timiz&at&i&on of t\he supply structure of touris/m industry and ste'ady expansion of the demand for tourism consumption, and p)r)omot)ing t<he su$sta$inab$le and healthy development of scen-ic spots and t~ouris~m industry.
The Natio|nal Development a-nd Reform C(om(mis(sio(n also emphasizes tha}t various regions sho<uld strengthen the regulation of price or%der in scenic spots, guid{e scenic spots to improve t`h`e`i`r services, and e*nsure to reduce pr&i&ces wit;hou;t re%ducing quality.
Moreover, fo=r t$he problems tha_t t<he decreasing am+p+litud+e of tic,ke,t prices in some scenic spots is too small an|d so-called reduct|i|on but no practical r&e&duc&tion re?c?e?ntly reported by t`he med'ia, the National Development and Reform Commission ha,s made a special inspection to r"e"qui"re vari(ous regions to s'erio'usl'y solve th|e problems, timely respond to the so!cial conc\e\rns, and e<f<f<ectivel<y implement price reductions.

`.` The comprehensive technology o@f the film-free cotton developed by us can c;ompl;etel;y realize the cott/on planting without th!e fi|lm, and can comp,l,e,te,ly solve the p?robl?e?m o-f residual f#il#m po|llution and real(ize green cotton planting. "
Yu Shuxun described, a,n academician o"f the Chinese Ac`a`dem`y of E]ngin]e]e]ri]ng.
Xinjiang is C<hin<a ’ s most important cotton-producing region . According to t%he National Bureau of Statistics, t=he cotton pl.antin.g a.rea i_n Xin@j@i@a@ng i'n 20~17 was 3<5 million mu, accounting f!or 6.1% o-f the national cotton area.
Since the introduc`tio`n of mulching f$ilm in China i~n 1=982, the filmed area o_f v=ariou=s types o$f crops in Xinjiang has reached more tha#n 50 million mu, and the annual us_e o$f mu^lc^hing film is about 30 m<i<ll<i<on t`o`ns.
A?mon?g them, cotton mulching film coverage r]at]e reached 100%, a*nd cot[ton field mu%lc%hing f#ilm accounted for about 60% of Xinjian!g f&ilm us^e.
Use fil-m-free cotton for prod~u~ct~ion measurement, a)nd t?h?e cotton output can b{e fully realized fr,o,m 3_20 kg to 35&0 kg per mu.
With the increasing amount of mulching f[il[m input in Xi/nj/iang, the residual film recovery rate i;s lo`w, the res=i=dual film volume in the soil is gradually increased, a{nd the s,oil structure dama/g/e/s and other pro(b(lems caused b<y re's'idual film se=rio=usly affect@s the sust[ainable development of agricultu>re.
T-he residual fi@l@m not only c+aus+e+s serious pollu`ti`on to the s{o{il, but also h/as a great influence on the quality of c<otton f}ibe}r.
Currently, more than one-third of the cotton field]s in X#i#n#jia#n#g ha>ve achi`e`v`ed m\ec\haniz\e\d harvesting.
In 2@0@17, Xinj"iang mechanized harvesting are!a is about 14 mi)lli)o)n mu.
In the process o'f cotton mecha;n;i;zed ha#rv#esti#ng, a large amount o\f brok*e*n film o^n earth sur]face and the co(t(to(n plant are p^ic^k^ed u:p . The broken film doped in the raw cotton is difficult t;o re)m)ove during the processing of raw cotton, and cannot b)e c@om@ple@tel@y removed i$n th{e subsequent textile processing p)roc)es)s, seri"o"us"ly affecting t-h-e qual*ity of textile products.
On Se<ptemb<er 2[8, the na]tion]w]ide film-free cot"ton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities w.er.e he:ld in Xay<ar County, Xinjiang.
In order to solve the c>otton mulching film pollution, s`imp`lify the cotto.n planting technology a:nd improve the cotton field effic"ienc"y, Yu Shuxun led his t+eam to u[s[e 8 years t(o implement th$e "Ch]ines]e Cotton 619 ',' f)i)lm-)free cotton techn&ology plant]in]g, adding "a@dv@an@tag@e@s ',' to Xinjiang ’ s agricultural gre,e,n development.
Yu Shuxun i<n<tr<oduced, with t[h[e new idea of innovative breeding, t@hey cultivate a new line o<f extra early rip=e=nin=g, s/aline-/alkal/in/e tolerance, lo(w tempera[tu[re resistant, and hi+g+h y\ie\ld upland cotton `=` C"hinese Cotton 619".
`%` ‘ C;hin;es;e C'ot'ton 619 ’ h[as achieved a series of supporting me|asur|e|s such as film-free seeding machinery, improved seeding dep}th, shallow buried i]n drip irrigation zon-e, suitable se=eding density screening, an[d reasonable chemical regulation under th}e condition o[f film-free cult\i\va\tion in southern Xin&jiang&. `}`
A=t pre"sent, Ak+su, Ko]rl]a, A=l=ear and other places h-ave established a demonstration base for film-free cotton, with a yield o.f 4<,80<0 kg per hec}tare.
Film-free cotton planting has achieved hi$g$h y`i`eld, co^st sa~vi~ngs, environmental protection an"d improved o"verall benefits.
Zhang Donghai, a'n ag{ronomist at the Third Divisio.n of the A#gricu#l#t#ural Sc&ie&nce Research Institute of Xinjiang Production an@d Construction Corps, said th_at through nearly six yea.rs of re/sea/r/ch a)nd demons?trat?io?n o#f film-free cotton cultivation techniques, th}e production of film-free c/ott/on/s/eed c.otton ca[n fully achieve 320 kg t]o 350 kg per mu, a:n:d may even b?e higher.
"The p(romo(tion of film$-f$r$ee cotton cu:ltiva:ti:o:n technology has gre,at prospects. "
Zhang D`ongha`i believes t'h'a't a@t present, the film-free cotton c?u?lt?i?v?at?ion technology can completely solve the problem of soil residu&al film po<llut<i<on, but there is st/ill a ce~rt~ain gap betwe)en the current eco.n.om.i.c benefits and t}h}e cultivation o+f m!ulc!hing film.
"Th;e s<uppo<rt of cotton purchasing price wi-ll be conducive t`o future promotion. `%`
Yu Shuxun said th}a}t i"n the next s+t+e+p, he and hi?s t&ea&m will continue to conduct in-depth r$e$sear$c$h and large-scale promotion a_nd application of the film-free c&o&tton, ma(king the i/n/du/s/try o^f film-free cotton larger an%d stronger, and co%mplet%ely so?l?v?ing the pr;obl;e;m o}f soil pollution caused by the film.

The ex-foreign aid acc]u]sed Beij)ing B/G Football Club of match-fixing, a*nd Beijing BG Football C,lu,b r`esp`onde`d that i{t was "baseless '"'--ECNS
Yesterday afternoon, Beijing BG Football Club (h;ere;i;n;afte;r referred to as B&G) made an official response t$o i[ts ex:-:f:or:ei:gn aid Anichebe's accusation th=at it was su\s\pected of p<layi<n<g match-fixing . BG declared tha_t t]he club nev$e$r playing a]ny match-fixing . I.t w>as absolutely a lie fa]bri]ca]ted out o~f thin air b}y Anichebe so that he could c{over up the f'act that h$e h^ad br&a&ze&n&ly breached the contr/a/ct and realiz{e hi@s personal improper economic purpose in the course of arbitration.
A!t the same time, B/G indica.ted that it would r]ese]rve the r<i<g<ht to tak,e all means t{o hold the relevant pa=rty accountable.
According to t#he "Dail'y Mai~l" from UK, Nigerian player Anichebe reported to the F)IFA that BG Tea?m he played at last year was suspected o!f playing match-fixing, i^nc^lud^ing th/e 2+1+st Beijing Derbies of CF*AC*L i<n t@he 2017 se^a^son.
Beijing Renhe was at the critic?al s~tage o]f winnin=g promotion to the top tier a|t th-at time, and B~G finally l\ost 0-2 away to Beijing Ren+he . A%niche%be played from the fir"st minute in th`e game.
BG Clu_b made a'n official resp*onse to t|h|is Nigerian pla!ye!r's accusation yesterday.
It declared that af}t}e}r pr/e/viousl/y c@a@rryin@g out th$e internal i?nv?e?s?tigat?ion, the club found n)o match-fixing in t'he past games.
Anichebe j[oined Beijing B`G in June, 2017 . In Dec;e;mber o"f that year, A[niche[be re)fu)sed t>o ret'u'rn to the team t@o take p!art in t-he winter training without any justified rea*so*n . Although th+e club repeatedly urged, h/e still refused to return.
A*t present, th`e dis:put:e between t=he two parties has been submitted t+o the F$I$FA and the arbitration i.s in progress.
It al-so de'clar'ed that the h'igh-p'rofile `=` match-fixing allegation" was actually a lie fabricated o%u%t of thin air b-y Ani(c(heb(e s,o th[at h&e could cover u[p the fact that he had brazenly breached the contract and r|e|a|lize hi!s pe]rso]n]al imprope=r economic purpose in the course of arbitration.
His s_o_le aim o}f slandering the club and Chin^e^se fo`o`tball was t,o obtain the illegitimate e,con,om,ic benefits.
T#he cl:ub would not accept any groundless accusations, defamation, vi"l"ifi"ca"tio"n and slander made by any organization o=r i=ndivi=dual due t&o its e<co<no<m<ic benefits a+nd personal grud>ge.
Therefore, BG indi]ca]ted tha$t it would reserve the right t[o ta{ke al_l means t=o hold the relevant party ac:coun:table.

W^a^n^g Yi, the Chinese S)t)ate Councilor and Foreign Minister ma;de a speech at the C&ou&n&cil o*f Fo!r!ei!gn Relations on Friday, a&n&d sai$d th+at currently, the China-U.S. relation came t@o a crossroad again . I'f bot{h s*i*des can actively treat each other wi#th to~lerance, expand and dee<pen the positive cooperation, and properly contro[l d"ifferenc"es and contradictions, th>ey can o$p$e$n up a bet>ter prospect.
"The China-]U].S. re}l}at}ion is our common asset w>hic>h needs u's t|o care about together. "
He said that it was exp-ecte-d that people o_f insight fro&m all se+ct+o+r+s o,f bo>th cou!n!tries to|o|k pra|c|ti|cal actions to maintain t?h?e healt)hy and stable development o)f the China-U.S. relation and j`ointl`y drove the China-U.S. relation to mo>ve forward in the right direction.
W@an@g Yi a<lso emphasized a}gain that China wa?s certain to take a development road di@f@fe@r@e@nt from tha&t o|f the traditional great powers.
T{his road with Chinese characteristics determined that Ch}i}na would not or ca/n not r_e_p_e_at th{e mi^s^ta^k^e o!f a strong country becoming a hegemon, a{nd determined that Chin\a wo.uld no+t become another United States, or cha+ll+enge the Unit|e|d States, or even replace the Un>ited S$ta$t$es.
Wang Yi made a spee@ch with the topic of "Oppo/rtu/nit/y or c,hal,lenge, p%artne%r or opponent" an`d s$aid th.at curr+entl+y, the pro}f}ound crux of the problem is t(hat some American friends b-elie-ve-d t"hat China would also make a m|i|sta|ke of a str|ong country becoming a hegemon, and even cha)llen)ge a-n-d r;ep;lace the leadership of the Unit@e@d States i|n th~e world.
"This is obvi.o.usl.y a m\aj\or strategic misjudg|men|t. "
H^e s(a(id that this self-ima!g!in!e!d suspicion was spre+adi+ng, an!d had amplified t"he existing contradictions, giving rise to new doubts, and mak^ing i]t more dif<f<icult for Chin\a and the United S_tates to solve specific problems and encounter m#o#r#e r`es`i`s`ta`nce.
Wang Y]i pointed o|ut t.ha.t the road Ch/i/n/a was walking on was a road fo^r peaceful deve^lopm^e^nt.
Chinese people have ne%ve%r ha?d a gene for exp<an<sio<n.
It was believed t_h_a_t all coun-t-ries can live i}n harmony, and m{a{k{e exch%ange%s an!d mutual learning.
Regardless of past, present or futu~re, Ch\i\n\a would never copy foreign mo%dels, or requi%re ot#h#er countries t\o c/op/y China '/s practices.
Earlier, when Wang Yi m.e.t wi:th Kissinger, the former U.S. Se*cretary of S!tate, in New York, he said that China-U.;S. cooperation wou(l(d b]e win-win a/nd the c$o$n$fr$ontatio$n would be n.ece.s.sari.ly lose-~lo~se.
The Ch'i'ne'se side was always committed t;o developing t^h^e long-term, healthy and stable Chi^na-U.S^. relation a(nd achie[vi[ng no c)o)nfl)i)ct, no confrontation, mutual re@sp@ec@t and w+in-win cooperation.

Ac}cordi}ng to the reports, t~h~e t[sunam[i stroke Donggala i+n Pal"u t&wi&c&e since it was near the epicenter of t:he quake . After the `_` golden 72 hours '=' for rescue, t\h\e a&u&tho&r&ity thought that the death to`ll wo#u#ld c'o'n'tinue to rise.
On September 30, 2018 loc'al time, th?e rescuers we^re carrying an earthquake survivor s~av~ed under the ruins o<f a r[estaurant i)n Pa'lu, Centra(l Sulawesi, Indonesia.
An official from the disa"st"er relief department s_ai_d t^h^at the huge waves bro]u]ght by tsunami were u@p t)o 6 meters high . The imp:acts of e`a`rthquake an?d tsunami had exceeded pe[op[le '#s original estimation.
I$t w:as l_earned th{at hundreds of people were celebrating a festival on t`h`e beach when the e-a-rthqu-ake and t%suna%mi struck . Many pe!ople were swep/t away by huge waves a<n<d died.
An official s-ai-d that th$e t}su}na}m}i w<a<s mo{v{ing towards the shore at 8#00 miles an h(our, and a lot of b?ui?l?d?ings and infrastructures we>r>e destroyed.
H<e said that thousands of houses, h&o&spit&al&s, s}hop}pin}g malls and hotels collapsed, and the debris flow ca`us`ed by th"e tsunami c?ut off a majo:r high`w`ay i?n Pal/u.
In Sulawesi, a bridge acros[s a coastal ri+ver fel+l do\w\n.
O|n September 30, 2018 local time, Joko, the P~reside~nt of In+do+n+esia, visited Pal\u in Centra.l Sula$wesi after t&he ear/thquake.
The Indonesian President Jok]o visited t<he disaster areas on Septem<ber 3)0, a'n'd sai^d that the troops had bee`n sent out to assist the rescue . H,e also called for th_e victims to b(e p:at:i:ent.
Joko pointed o|ut that it was very h]ar]d to carry out th-e r.escue a)c)t)i)v)i)t)ie)s because o/f insufficient heavy-duty machines a$n$d people.
He h!ea!rd t)ha)t m[any disaster are>a>s were short of d+r+in+king water, food, f,uel and ot&he&r ma,t,er,ial,s, and m+any st<ores were closed after the earthquake . Th>erefore, planes were sent out to airlift s-uppl-ie-s.
H^e called for the vict/i/ms to be patient, and asked t(he(m to st}ay in t/he original loc^a^tion to w'a'it for rescue.
The rescuers i+n Palu said they heard cries fo$r help from a inside buried h*otel, b;ut th@ey co.u.l.d d#o nothi:n:g be`ca`u`s`e they didn't have heavy-duty machines to re?mov?e the rubbles . Some rescuers had t'o save peo&ple with the*ir bare h=and=s.
Ka.lla, the V/ice Presi<de<nt o#f Indonesia, sa>id that the electricity and communic|ation in so[me places were cu~t off, so the information wa.s blocked . The nu&m&ber of deaths in this eart$hq$uake and t)su)nami might finally rise u)p to several tho.usan.ds.
CNR News, S"hen"yang, November 5 (Reporte<r Xu Zhiqiang, Correspondent Yan Yi[na) - The reporter l,ea,rn,ed from the Liaoning all pr'ovi'nc'i'al co`ur`t ’ s "basically res(ol(vi(ng the p\roblem o|f dif/ficul/tie/s i$n enforcement '?' dispatch meeting that t/he Liaonin<g all p@rovin@cial courts severely cr~a~c~ked down the behavior of r/ef/using to implement d+u+r+i+ng the six-month implementation o!f th^e "s*to*rm" campaign . Dur_ing the im)pleme)n)t)atio)n, a total of 241 people who committed th_e crimes of refusing t)o implement were tr+ansfered, maintaining a high pres"s"ure against the cri*me of refusing t#o commit cr#i#mes.
It is understood t{h{a{t i\n accordance with the unified deployment of the Liaoning High C;o;urt, fro?m the beginning of April t}o the end o\f September, the Liaoning courts c@ar@ri@e@d ou`t a six-month "basically resolving t/he pr-obl-e-m o&f difficulties i.n enforcement" `>` s=tor=m" ca)mpai)g)n, gathered th<e superior forces, and launched a comprehensive general attack o!n th@e `'` basically resolving the p<robl<em of difficulties i`n enforcement '>'.
At t[he same time, the p:rovinc:ial courts organized a `"` five b:atc:h:e:s" campaign, including a b!atc!h of fi;nes, a batc;h o@f ca`m`p`aign, a batch o.f restricted wit@h con*su*m*ption, a batch o<f dishon(es(t(y punishment a+nd a batch of transferring for refusing to implement.
A|t the beginning of t!he campaign, there we=re more than 132,000 pending execution cases i\n t|he pr.ovinci.al courts . At th.e end of July, the c!ase w|a|s cl;ea;red.
D|uri|ng th_e ca]mp]aign, the provincial courts imposed a total fine o>f 12,060,700 yuan on t"he p,erson,s subject t(o enforcement, and 4,146 people were de\tained, 16'2,844 peo+pl+e w{e{re restricted wit&h consumption, 55,/12/8 were punished for dishonesty, and 241 we-re transfered for refusing t^o implement.
From J^a^nuar^y to Octo~b~er of this year, the Liaoning court;s acc$e$pt$ed a to|tal o:f 297,438 cases o$f execution, a year-on-year inc(re(a(se o,f 13.28%; 226,558 cases were executed and settled, a year-on-year increase o#f 83.18%; t=he impleme/ntation r<ea<c<hed 31.236 billi"o"n yuan, a year-on-ye`ar i%n%crea%s%e o-f 74.94%.
`~` Where ca&n we take a tax<i?
We'd l{ike t<o go t:o the Golden Bauhini|a Sq;u;are to watch the National Day flag-raising ceremony! `:`
I'n th=e morning of October 1, Mr and Mrs Song, w~ho sp,ecia,lly flew from Ningxia t>o Shenzhen and transferred t`o the f`i`rst train o$f Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong E#x#p#r#ess Rail Link for National D%ay, accepted an interview o.f a reporter from Chin:a N;ew;s a-t the We-st Kowloon s{t{ati{on in Hong K>o>ng and inquired suc=h information.
In the morning o<f O+cto+ber 1, i;n order to celebrate t_he 69th anniversar|y of the founding of t"he People's Rep]ub]l]ic o\f China, the Hon<g Kong SAR Governme:nt held a g:r:a:nd flag-raising ceremony a`t the Golden Bauhinia S,q,u,are.
According to the statistics o(f t@h@e Immigration Co]ntrol Poin=t, as of S=eptember 30, the number of passengers enteri*n*g H"ong Kong via the We=st Ko`wl`o`on station o%f the high-speed rail%wa%y have exceeded 300,000.
A.t the very t&ime of the 69th anniversary of the founding of t~he P-eople's Repub'lic of China, th!e West Kowloon boundary ch~ec~kpo~int predicts a peak of visitor/s to H>on>g K$ong o}n October 1 a#nd 2.
The repo)rt)e)r sa]w at the arrival l!o!bby around 7:00 a.m. o?n Oct+o+ber 1 that many mainlan[d tourists t"o"ok advantage o]f the Na%t%io%na%l Day Go`ld`en Week, to take the high-speed rail and v$i$sit Hong Kong.
Mrs Song wi"th light|-|foot|edness to#l#d the reporter that the National Day holiday was a rar=e long holiday in a year . I&t has a"lwa"y"s been her wish to co#m#e to t(he Golden Bauhinia Square i.n H|ong Kong t]o watch the flag-raising cerem_ony . She fe;lt very happy and ex/c/ite/d t;o b^e a#b#le to accomplish this will on N/atio/nal Day.
But cu.r.r.ent.ly, the flig=hts between Ningxia and H"ong Kong are inconvenient . Tha<nks to the opening of the high-speed railway for th&e Ho}n}g Kong segment . Mr Son~g checked t^he train schedule an~d fo(un(d that t$h$e first train could arrive at 7:03 a.m., a,n,d i?t was p^e^rf^ec^t tim+ing for taking u^r^ban transportation means to t)he G{ol{den Ba!uhinia Square.
H~e told the reporters, `~` t+he high;-spee;d railway is very conveni<ent, fast and on ti{m{e! "
The 70 dail*y o$ne$-h$our short-(hau(l trains runni+ng betwe#e#n Gua\ngzh\ou Sout(h, Shenzhen North, Fu^t^ia^n and West K,ow,loon greatly facilitated the residents in Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao G{re{ater Bay Area to visit Hong Kong.
Afte$r ar/ri/ving in Ho{ng K]ong, Mr L<i<u, wh(o lived in Shenz.he.n, was preparing to join his Hong Kong friends a&t the to]p of a h'i'll in Central.
M]r L]iu said, "b;o;th th@e mainland and H}o}n}g Ko+n+g have holidays on National Day . We intend to chall;eng;e ourselves a{nd see if we can complete walking the 50-kilometer H!ong K\ong T%ra%i%l! "
He explained that th&e&y would not dare to m;ake suc^h a l.ong trek without the convenience a&n&d sufficient time brought about by th)e h!igh-!s!peed rai*lw*a*y.
Mrs Ya(ng, who came from Dongguan, too.k her 10-year-old so_n to come t*o Hon@g Kong t;o participate in th%e piano c,om,p,et,ition b"y t]aking the high-speed railway . She proudly told t]he r]ep]or]ter that her son ha'd b=ee=n stud'y'ing piano for three ye%ar%s, and i_t wa}s very meaningful to spend the National Day in this way.
She ha&d previously co<me to Hong Kong by b%us, but i;t was time-consuming a!nd laborious . She wa`s worr~i~e~d about affecting h%e%r son ',s condition . This time she ca)me from Shenzhen by h^igh-s^pe^ed railway . T@he customs clearance w|a|s co$nvenient and the time w>a>s redu'ced b$y half . S]h]e wa:s more impressed by the tri~p in Hong Kong segment . She told t;h;e reporte%r, "it seems like taking th(e subway, whic,h is v>e>ry fast . I am not able t%o d%o take photos before arriving! `-`
A[t 6:44 a..m. on September 2"3, th;e G5711 "Harmony" high-sp>eed train departed from Shenzhen North Railway Sta|ti|on and sped all the wa/y . A f(e(w minutes la.ter, the train entered th$e Hong Kong se}gmen}t of G{ua{ng{zh{ou{–She{n{zh{e{n–Hong Kong Express R:a:i:l Link . This was th_e first formally ope(rate(d high-speed tra_in in th$e Hong Kong segm*ent.
Th:e Hong Kong segment o?f the high-speed ra@ilway, which integrates t"he natio)nal 25*,000-kilomet*er high-speed rail netwo*r*k an_d reaches 38 long-'distan'ce s(tation(s throughout the country, also welcomes mainland touri~s~ts from different provinces far apart from e#ach other.
Mr Gao, w`ho t~ook advantage of minor va[c[at[io[n to visit relatives in Hong Kong from Changsha, to-l-d th`e reporter th<at previously, the hi*g*h*-spee*d r<ailw<a<y c+ould only travel t$o Shenzhen North, and he needed to t]ak]e the subway to p\ass through Hong Kong, and then ta#ke u{rb{an transportation me=a=ns . I[t was trou@ble@so@me and time-consuming to make tr(a(n(s(fers . Now, he ca(n travel directly t'o t_he center of K[ow[loo[n and have lunc?h whi%c%h was made b=y his children w.hen getting hom-e . He fe#l#t very happy.
He sa&i&d that the "one port an;d t.w.o immigration inspection '!' customs clearance pr\ocedu\r\e w<er<e very convenient beyond imagination, a[nd `|` passing both customs within 10 minutes. `-`
The W=est Kowloon Station, which is clo,s,e to t)he Airport Expr@ess and connects l_a_nd and air tr(affic, ha<s also becom+e the preferred des:tinati:on for many transit passengers.
Miss Wu, f>ro>m Fujian Province, prepared to spend th\e Golden Week with her f-rie-nds traveling from Hon+g K"ong to Philippines . Pushing her luggage out of the gate o?n tim?e i\n W(est Kowloon, s.he told the repor&ter wit\hout hesitation, `^` I w#as afraid o$f no(t cat|ching u;p with t,he plan]e, but I didn't t_hink it would be so fast and that was more than e:noug:h!

According to t`he su_bs_idi_a_ry arrangement of th\e trade agreement pub?lished on Monday, th-e ne!w U.S. -M~ex~i~co-Canada t\r\ad\e agreement will re>tain the President Tr#ump's ability to implement the threat to impose a 25% tariff o'n imp:orted cars, while e~s~s~en~tially exempting pas[seng[er cars, p\i\cku\p trucks and auto parts imported from C#an#ad#a and Mexico fro[m paying tar,iff,s.
If T,rump imposes a so-called "Chapt(er 2|3|2" tariff on cars f_or na<tion<a<l s*ecu*r*it*y reasons, M:e:xico and Canada will h{ave a tax-exempt quota of 2.6 milli~on passenger cars exp@orted to t_h_e United States each yea?r.
According to t'h'e subsidiary arrangement, the pic)kup trucks manufactured in bot#h countries w~ill b{e fully exempted from t+ari+ffs.
I[f Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexi{co wil>l recei&ve a t)ax exemption quota of $108 billion e#a#ch year fo/r a/uto parts, an+d Canada will receive a qu.o.ta o<f $32.4 billion.
These t<wo quotas ar%e f_ar higher t\h\a\n the current produ*c*ti*on l&e&v&e&l&s of t`he two countries, an,d provide their exports with growth space.
R&e&port of Reuters o+n Septem&ber 28 i<n Washington/Mexico: Mexico said on F"r"id"ay that after days of debates, t{h{e U.S. P(res(iden(t T]r]u]m]p '@s g|o|ve|rn|me|nt and Ca_na_da w}e}r}e making rea,l ef]fo]rts to reso|l|ve tra~d~e policy differences, raising hopes that the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) would ma.int.a.in the form o^f a tripartite agreement.
De+sp+i+t+e lack of details, the obvious progress menti:oned above is enough to prompt the M=e=xic=an and American governments t!o abr<u<p<tl<y stop publishing the t+ext of th\e two-party trade agreement an(d give Canada more t,i,m,e to j{oin th(e a$g$r$e$emen$t.
An%d%r%es Manuel Lopez Obrador, t-h-e Mexican presid@e@n@t-elect, told the r:ep:ort:e:rs i&n Me_xi_co that t'h'e U.S^. government had made n/e/w counter-proposals to the Canadian government a}nd s#ai#d he would continue to u$r$ge these three countries to participate i_n NAFTA.
Il&defonso Guajardo, the Mexican Minister of Ec{on{omic Affairs, s-aid t]he tim^e for subm^itting the text o=f t$he US-Mexico trade agreement to the legislation de`partme`n`ts of M*ex*ico a%n%d th<e United States had been delayed because t"he Canadian a\nd American governments tried to reach an agre&emen&t "ver+y seriously".
Guajardo said, "In the next 48 hours, w(e will kn_ow whether we wil-l ge%t a text o)f a tripartite agreement o>r ha[v[e t\o publish the text of t(he two-party a*gr*eem*ent*. `"`
G&uajardo said that t;h;e officials at t@he same lev\el in the U.S. and Canada had "special re*quest*s '~' t#o postpone to publish th^e text.
T"h"e spokesman of the Of}fic}e of the Un>ite>d Sta,tes Trade R(ep(resenta(tive (USTR) did n.o.t c}o}mment o#n the text of the bilateral trade agreement between the Un]ited Sta;tes and Mexico an<d the negotiations between t"he Un(it(ed States and Canada.
Officials o`f the Prime Minister '>s Office and t;he Office of Minister for Foreign Affairs o>f Canada d`id not r(es(pon(d to r~e~qu~es~ts f-or comment on th!e counter-proposal.
According to foreign media repo(rt(s, it was har!d for pe%opl%e to find anything unusual in two li%tt%le lions pl]aying i(n a conservation ce,n,te,r located i#n the s/uburb in Pretoria, th]e cap(ital of Sout?h Af+ric+a, but they were absolutely unique.
Un$iver$si$ty o%f Pretoria annou(nced: "They are th_e f_irs_t lions in the history, w_hich a[re born by art<ific<i<a<l insemination--t'h'e first pair of lio;ns in the world. "
The scientists of the universit,y w-e-r-e comm*i*ttin*g t_h_e_mselve_s to studying t?he reproductive system of fe-ma-le African lions.
Ga-n-sw-i-ndt, the director of Mammal Institute of University of Pretoria, said that these tw*o little lio(ns born on August 25 wer,e a f.emal.e l(i(o(n a[nd a male li"o"n . They we.re p`retty hea}l}thy and quite norma=l.
After the intensive tests in 18 months, h*is t`ea`m fin#a#lly ma)de this break)t)hr)ough.
Ganswi|n|dt sa<i<d in a med~ia interview: "We collected t|he sp_erm_s from a healthy male l'ion'. "
Next, the researchers wa_ited f`or the hormones in the femal)e lion to reach a proper lev"el s>o as to conduct the a/r/tifici/al inse-m-in-at-io-n i/n i;t.
Ganswindt said: "F.o.rtunately, t(he re:sult turned out to be s*ucce*ssful. "`
He said that t@h@e researchers "tried many t$imes, but to t`heir surprise, it d^id n`'t take much effor+t '='.
H"e sa`id that the above-mentioned r!esearch breakthrough could be ve}r}ifi}ed repeatedly, and the scie$n$tists hoped to use t{hi{s technology to sav$e the endan<ger<e<d bi_g cats.
T-he International Unio-n fo%r Conservation o;f Nature i;ndica;t;e;d t}h}at t,h,e lion had al}rea}dy become extinct in 2#6 African countries, and the total number of survival wil"d lio@ns had d@ecl@ined shar#ply b=y 43% in the past 20 years with onl#y about 20,000 wild lions left.
The African li+on w,as l(isted as v,u,lner,a,b,l,e by this organization.
Ganswindt said: "This animal will be in d\anger o-f extinc't'i'on i'f we do nothing for t[h[e[m[. `~`
He said that with this kind o+f new technology, it '_s not necessary for the l#ions t#o be f$ed . The s%perm%s c*ould be injected into the bodie@s o+f female lions, just like th-e approach adopting o`n t,he el?eph?ants in ca%p%t%ivity in N"orth America and Europe.
The export<s of South Korea fell the most in more than tw"o year%s i:n S_eptemb_er, but analysts put the blam&e o`f the de,clin,e on fewer working d_ays and sai,d that although t~h~e t}rade tension between Chi"na and the United St-at-es rose, the global demand fo$r South Korean goods remained str'ong.
Ind\eed, the average daily exports o*f South Korea in,cr,eas,e,d la(s(t month.
M@ore@over, the initial va@lu@e data rel^ease^d ea$rlier showed th~at the exports in first w-eeks of September during the long vac#at#ion had a do'ubl'e-di'git increase.
Th(e y>ear-on-year drop of South Korea|n exports i'n September was the largest since July 20'16, whi=ch was more than th$e d=e=cre=ase of 5.7% estimated by 1]1 analysts of Reu&te&r&s surveys.
The initial v&alue rele`ase`d on M<o<n<day sho/wed that the amo?unt of e^xports in Sep%te%mb%e%r wa%s $50.6 bi]ll]ion, lower than $51.2 billion in August.
Although the China-US trade disputes w-ith i+n+ten+s+i+f+yi+ng concerns m(ight cause other neighboring c:oun:t:ries of China w#hic#h depended on expo~rts t"o suffer, Korean exports to China in Sept<e<mb<er i@ncr@eased b@y 7.8%, expanding for th$e 23rd consecutive mont~h.
Si^nce the sales o(f o|il products de+cline+d, Korean ex*po*r*ts t|o America decreased by 11.8%.
Although the market w]or]r]ie]d that the so-ca(l(l(e(d "supercycle '#' of chi/ps mi>ght reach t@he peak, the overseas sale!s of Ko{rean memory chips and oil p[rod[uc[t[s increased by 2`8.`3% and 13.5% res<pectively.
"However, the influence o>f trade co|nfl|ict|s can n+o+t b`e avoided, becaus*e Korean exports considerably de'p'end on American an!d Chinese markets. `[`
The imp_o_rts decreased by 2&.1% to $40.8 b*i*lli*o*n, inferior to the i$n$c$r$ease o>f 3_._1% estimated by th'e Reuters s/urv/ey.
T!he initial val-u-e of trade sur.p.lus in September was $9$.7 billion, hi(g(he(r tha@n $6.`9 billion in August.
T~he Department of Ind;ustr;y said t>ha>t thanks to America and t;he E_U coun`trie`s, th$e global m}anufacturi}n}g would maintain buoyant, whic-h was a favorable factor for Korean exports.
T,h,e sta%tement poi~n~ted out, "the increasing export pr(i(ce c`aused by the ri"se o;f the oil price will be beneficial to the e!xpo!rts in the second half of th$is year. `/`
"However, the trade con_f_lict between the United Sta/te/s and China continues an\d t;he mark)et fluc=tua=t=ion after rising U.S. interest ra#t#es intens-i-f-ie-s, which are bo{t{h negative pressure on e'x'p'orts'. "
The average ex}por}ts of eac`h working d_a_y in September i/n/cr/ea/se/d to $2.6 billion, whi*le the a`mount in Au]gus]t was $2.1 billio!n.
Th,e Mid-Autumn F&estiva&l in South Korea this y)ear w^as from Sep!tembe!r 24-26 so that there were only 19.5 working days in Se:p:tember, four days less than t\h\e sa]me pe}r}io}d l,a,st year.
T'h'e Korean exports fro.m January to September incr)eased b<y 4=.=7% co+mpared w{ith that of the same period last year.
According t!o the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, activities of Korean manufacturing rose again i@n September w)hich w<as supported b,y dom}e}st}ic o/rders, s`in`c`e Chinese and Japanese orders declined, which would pr[oba[bly cas!t a shad^ow ove_r export prospects.
North Ko/rean media criticized the United S?tates fo<r not easing the sanctions o&n N^or^th Korea.
North Korea '(s "Rodong S}hin}mun" published a signatured r#e#vi#ew article on Se+p+t+e+mber 30 t-o criticize the United Stat,es for not e}a}si}n}g the sanc.tions o&n North Korea while seeking to hav~e a d_i_alogu_e with N<ort<h K;or;e;a . The article s/aid that it was a "self-contradictory '{' action.
The article said that Pompeo, t;h;e United St~a~t~es Sec`r`etary of St#ate, indicated on September 14 that `?` th=e key t'o achieve t:he denuclearization o:f the Korean Peninsula was to impose t+he sanctions o;n Nort:h Kor.ea" t'o emphasize that th(e U=n=ited States would keep its position o&n implementing the UN r\es\o\l\uti\on to impose sanctions.
In the N!or!t!h Kor:ea-US Join?t Statement of Singapore, t[he two sides p"romis"ed to build a new North Korea-US relation, which comp[lie[d w=i=th the two pe|o|ple|s' wish:es of l=ooking for[war[d t;o peace and prosperity.
On on+e side, the Uni=t=ed States increased th^e in(te(n(sity of sanctions, but o<n the other s^id^e, it asked f#or th?e dialogue . Undoubtedly, i$t$s actions were sel!f!-contr!adic!to!r!y.
According t]o t@h@e arti|cle, i&f it wanted to buil$d a new N@ort@h Korea-US relation, esta_b_lish a permanently c.onsol.ida.ted system o?f peac@e in the K^orean Peninsula, and ac&h&i&eve t\he d+en+uc+l+ea+rizatio+n of the Korean Peninsula, it would put bui_lding trust in the fi]r]st place, start from what can b{e done, and s\olve the problems by stag:e:s.
The article also sa`id that the Un@ited States sh(ould u|nde|rsta|n|d that it wouldn't wor$k to i*m*po*s*e sanctions on Nor@t@h Korea.
The article said that ev:e:n th)e `$` Severodvinsk '=' preceded the "Ka}za}n" w-as admired by the U!.S. military.
Th|e National In?teres?t quotes the view of U.S N@avy a~s saying, "w^e will encounter a strong p)ot)ential opponent . It is enough to see the `;` Severodvinsk ')' submarine o&n&ly. "

The SA_R_F_T had formulated many laws an\d re^gu^l^at^io^ns a`nd notices t;o establish the standards f!or the radio and television a}dve}r}tisement broadcasting.
According t!o t%h%e requirements of the `[` Notice o<n Further Strengthening the Man>a>g>em>ent of T]V Shopping Vi(deo Advertisements in the Satellite Television Channels '[', t\he Sa~tell~i~te Television Channels should not broadcast the TV shopp.i.ng video advertisements duri~ng t-he time period from 1"8":0"0 to 24:00 every d~ay.
When t*he TV shopping video advertisements were b'r'o'adcas't'ed du-r-in-g other time periods, it would be not allowed to use the presen'te'rs for the p<ropaganda, to use the exaggerated "hawking ';' dubbing, tone a+nd movem#ent f)or the propaganda, to us|e the w*or*d*s of `\` orthopedic", "shaping", `%` penetrating fat '#', "losing fat" to promote or adv!ertise the b_rea_st enhancing products a;nd t&h&e w\eig\ht los-in-g products in dis}gu}i}sed f>orm .

EU m]ay Reach Crude Oil Purcha;se Agreement with I"ra"n
T?h?e U/S government announced t-ha-t it wi!ll restart a new round of sanc<tions against I"r"an in November and e?ven urge other countries to reduce imports o,f Iran oi#l.
How^ev^er, the American al{li{e{s d>id no!t seem to take the advice.
According t:o t*he US "Ne%w York Times", o!n 29th, during the i{nt{ervi{e{w, Zarif, F,o,rei,gn Minister of Ir"an, revealed that altho,u,gh the Unit!ed States th&re&a&tened t}o sanction any country t[ha[t does business with Iran, Tehran i[s approaching t[o reach an agr&e&ement on the s-ale of cr&u&de oil w'it'h EU.
T}h}e core purpose of this a'g'r'eeme'nt is to try t<o e|sta|blish a ne+w payment mechanism, w\hi\c\h is to replace the dollar transaction in th<e form o+f barte`r o:r domestic currency.
The p-u-r-po-se of this approach is t=o b*y*pass the United States and prevent the Unit|e|d S&t&ates f@rom impeding financial t<r<ans<fers.
Meanwhile, a'lt'h'o'ugh t<h<e EU is wo[rk[i[ng o*n facilitating the agreement, some Fre]nch and British officials a/re also worried that if the agreement is co|ncl|ude|d, it will be the mos-t overt co"nfront"atio"n between the E<U and the Uni~t~ed States again:s:t t~h~e U[S wi.thdra.wal from the Iran nuclear de;al.
Th\e U\S media s{aid that in the o{ne hour interview, Z[ar[if ’ s w>ords sounded more optim%i%stic than in recent months.
Be(c(ause the agr@ee@me@nt can "str%i%p '~' the traditional American allies and e)f)fectiv)e)ly break the US ’ s atte<mp<ts t;o cut Ira'n ’ s income.
`&` This can guarantee that we c!an sell oi>l an]d obtain benefits", Zarif believed . According t&o the agreement reached in 2015, e*a*ch cou*ntry has t/he le/gal rig]hts to make trade c'o'ntacts with Ira!n.
The head o{f Union f*or Foreign Aff*ai*rs Policy, F*e*de*ri*ca Mogherini, also said re-cen-tly th)at `^` no sovereign state o_r organization c<a<n accept ot\her people to decide who they ca>n trade with. "
How+ever, she also predicted tha't bef$ore t)h)e U(S g&ov&er&n&ment carried out the next step o@f sanctions in November, U{S leaders could adopt a series o-f finan%c%ial instruments aimed a*t banks, businessmen a:n:d countries that h+av+e commercial intercourses with Tehran.
I|n May of this y$ear, th)e U-S government un{ila{te{rally anno.u.nced it:s withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal on the gr-ounds that th'e agreement had deficiencies, sayi!ng that the agreement c'oul'd not p+ermane+n+t+ly prohibit Iran from pr*od*u*ci*n*g nuclear fuel.
The US then threatened t_o ban companies th.at buy Iran oil a!nd other commodities from doi-ng business i?n t>h>e Uni)te)d States.
Th@is threat f>o>r>ced some companies to leave T\e\h\r\an a:nd made the Iranian currency dropped sh$arply.
Companies s;uch as Airbus S(.A.S . and French o@i@l giant Total h%av%e canc!e!ll!ed b$i$llions of dollars in investment in Ir/an.
British an-d French offici:als said, th#e US government ma%y "take the lead ']'.
Unsurprisingly, accordin\g t[o a recent report by the T/urkish media, t*he US sanctions di-d no<t seem to have a major i)m)pa)c)t on I-r-an ’ s oil expo\rts.
Recently, Iran Oil Minister Za%nga%neh di&sclose&d th"a"t no country other tha"n South Ko<r<ea has stopped buying Iran o.il.
B;oth Z`a`rif an.d Iran President Rouhani believed th}a}t the purpose o\f a series of US actions is to `.` seduce" Iran ’ s b@r@each o,f t{h{e agreement.
Zarif al|so r>eg>ard>ed the U}S serial bla|st a+s not worthy of consideration . Wh$e$n as=ked i`f the US would overthrow the current Iranian government wi]th increasing financial p(r(ess(ur(e, Zarif ev\en lau^ghe^d . "I?t is a regime change strategy, and this i-s the true p&urpos&e of th)e US. "

Rel?ev?a?nt notices published o.n the website of the Ministry of F=inance said that the temporary non-imposition of withho*ld*ing inco~m~e tax f$rom foreign investors should meet several conditions a`t t"he s[a[m[e tim]e, including d$irect investment of foreign investo?r?s with profit-sharing, and equity investments of foreign investors, such a_s c@a@p@ita@l increase, gr:ee:nfi:eld investment an+d equity acq#u#i#sitio#n with prof&i&t-&s&hari&ng, bu`t ex:cludin:g ne<w, turning po"i"nt increase and acquisition o)f shares of li/s/ted companies (except for eligibl_e strategic investments).
I\t also inc^luded the part tha-t th<e profits allocated to the overseas investors belonged t~o the ea<rning<s from equity investments of d^ividen^ds and bon_us ge)nerated by the retained earn^ing^s which h)ad b)e)en ac\h\ieved for what was actually allocated to the investors by the enterprises held b!y Chinese re^s^i^dents.
For the profits u&sed by th&e overseas investors fo@r d/irect i<nvestment and pa!id i}n cash, the relevant pay+ment w{oul{d b:e d$irect$ly transferred f@r@om the acc%ou%nt of the profit allocation ente#rprise t\o th]e account of the invested e&nt&er&prise or equity transferor .

Th"e notification a}lso said th:at the overseas investors actually rec+ove+r+ed the direct invest[m[e[n[t which e)njoyed th?e pol?icy treatm~en~t of temporary exemption from withholding income tax via equity transfer, repurchase and liq%ui%da%t%ion . The deferred t^ax should be re*p*orted and paid t[o the tax department accor@ding to st~i~pulat~ed proce,du,re,s w!i!t!hin 7 days after actually c[ol[l[ecting relevant payments.
T/o encourage ove%rs%ea%s investors to c!ont!i!nue to invest and operate businesses in China, China's Ministry of Fin~an~c~e, Ministry of Commerce and other t#wo ministries a#nd commissions jointly r<e<le<ased notices a&t th(e end of 20*1*7 .

La_s_t we[ek, the Standing Committee of the State C@ounci@l d\etermi\ned that the applicable scope of temporary ex~e~mpti~on of withholding i+nc+om+e tax for reinvestment o~f foreign b^usinessm^en was extended from encouraged fore@ig@n inve(st(m(ent pro.jec.ts t.o all non-prohibited projects and f,i,eld,s, further strengthening t;h;e p/rotec/ti/on of intellectual property.
The reporter le}arned from t$h$e Na-tio-n-al H:ea:l:th Commission t~ha~t the p>revalen>ce of m;al;nu;t;ritio;n in our children and ado(lescen(ts had r/ed/uced but the p@revalen@c@e of overweight-obesity had significantly increased comparing to decades ago.
T`h`e expert pointed out t*h*a*t the most important concept t(o maintain a healthy weight wa+s the `^` p&r&eventive treatment of disease". T~he sc%ienti%f%ic fit|nes|s a'nd rational die~t should be vigorously promoted.
Accordi=n=g to the "Core Information on H*ealth Educatio$n o\f Chinese Adolescents and Interpretation (2018 version) '(' released by the Nationa]l H(ealth Commission recently, the key t&o maintain a h@ea@lt@hy weight wa$s the ra_tion_al d\i\et and scientific mo-vem-en-t.
The o[verweight, obesity and blind weight r=edu=ct=io=n wer:e harmful t`o health.
Th+e health hazard be.h.ind t)he `[` chubby children" could n%'%t be ignored.
Di@n@g Gangqiang, the head o/f Na(tional Institute for Nutrition and Health of Chinese Center for Disease Co.ntrol a>nd Prevent/io/n, said t?hat overweight-obesity could har{m th!e adolescents' normal g.rowth and development, have a negative i!m!pa!ct on the]ir men!ta!lit!y, behavior, cognition and intelligence, a~nd even c]ause hypertension, hyperglycemia an{d hyperli\p\i\demi\a in ch<ildren.
An[d the adolescents' o<v<erwei<gh<t-o<b<es<i<ty might continue in:to adultho!o!d, wh`i`ch would increase th>e adolescents' risk o~f having chronic diseases, such a@s h:yper:ten:sion and d/ia/b/et/e/s in their adulthood.
Di<ng Gangqiang sai?d that the overw/eigh/t rate was 9.@6% and the obesity rate w_a_s 6.4% am^ong Chinese children and adolescents o+f 6-]17 years old according t@o the Nutrition an]d Health Status Ins[p[ection of Chinese Residents in 2@0@1@0-2012 . Th}e s?u?m of these two rates was 1`6%.
Meanwhile, the characteristics of o|verwe|ight-|ob|e|sity among children and ado!le!scents were that the overweight-obesity r&a&te wa*s higher i[n bo|ys than in girls, and it was higher in cities t'han i&n villages . T^he ov$e$r$w$eig$ht$-obesity rate ha|d s>i>g>nific>a>n>tl>y increased i[n recent decades.
H+ow would the adolescents de)al with the over?we?i?ght-?obesity?
Zhang L|i, the deputy dir$e$ct$o$r o$f Science Fi+tness and Hea]lt]h Promotion Research Center o`f G.ene.r.al Administration of Sport of China, in~d~ica~ted th/a/t the primary causes o,f adolescent obesity at pre)sen)t were exc!es!sive caloric intake an&d inadequate physical activity.
F`or th~i~s ki:nd of simple obesity, we shoul_d lay emphasis on scien+ti+fic movement and reasonable diet contr`ol.
Zhang Li pointed out t<h<at t,he most impor't'ant concept t;o maintain a healthy we?ig?h?t w$a$s the "preventive treatment of disease '/', an"d an i]nteg]r]al p,art of i;t was to conduct the all-round science popularization education o{f s+chools, p%aren%ts an"d students, popularize the dangers o,f overweight and obesity, and i;ncreas;e the adolesce|nts' self-protection awareness.
The ad$ole$scen$ts shou_l_d t`ake t$he periodic physical examination to monitor the growth and de_ve_lopment index, su]ch as height a)n)d weight, s\o t>h>at the problems of o|verweight a>nd obesity could be discovered early and determined s)cientif)ic)al)ly to t>ake intervention measures in ti#m#e.
For t.hos.e adolescents wh~o are alr,eady overweight and o@b@e@se, Ding G.an.gqiang advised th!a!t starvation t`herap`y or semi-starvation the"ra"p"y shou{ld be avoided to control a<nd lose weight in a%d%d%it%ion to th/e act?ive and scientific arrangement of diet and movement since the adolescents ar^e in a spe?cial physiological stage . T)hey should not take d_rug_s blindly to l:ose weight.

China News Service, Yichang, October 1 (repo-rt-ed by G"uo Xiaoying an-d Liu Min)--The new{ly revised `'` Three Go>rges->Ge>z>h>o>uba Hydro Project Navigation Sc&he&du&l&ing Regulation" (h%erei%na%f%ter referred to a=s `?` Sched+ul+ing Regu*lati*on") was of@ficially enforced sta-rti-n-g fr$om October 1 . After tw)o years of navigation test, t#he Th\ree Gorges ship l]i]ft was officially scheduled t/oge/th/er with the navigation lo@ck i<n a unified way.
O=n the first da\y of enforcing t]he new regulations, th$e navigation in Three Gor$g$es-Gezh$oub$a wate{rs w|as in good order.
Three Go[r[g[es Nav"igation A)u)thorit)y released the first p|l|a|n o;f security check a\t 21:00 on Sep|tem|b|er 30, a&n&d carried out t,h,e security check on 160 ships, with 124 s"hi"p"s passing t]he security check.
The navigation authority arra;nged the first loc=king p;l;a;n after the en.f.orcement o?f new regulations at 14.:.0.0 on Oct*ober, 1.
After the enforcement of new regulations, th/e plan of security c+h+eck would be released once e)ve)r)y da(y at 9:00 and 21:00, and t^h^e p.la.n of pass_in_g dam would be released once eve'ry d|a|y a)t 14:00 an:d 20:00, s{o that the s<hip<s could flexibly arrang-e the plan of pa<ssing da(m.
T$h$e "`Classification Control" s<ched<uling pri^nc^iple o{f ship pa#ssi#ng dam was added in t{h{e `?` Scheduling Regulation". The priority of shi&p p;a;s;s;ing da*m wo*uld be determined accordi;ng to the functional l<o<cali<z<at<ion of navigation lock and ship lift res"pe"ct"ively . The short-term pa$ssenger ship passing dam would be adjusted to b"e in the same priority a\s t]h]e demonstration ship a$nd integrity ship.
This is al~so the official s|ched|uling of ship lif$t and navigation lo,ck af;ter the two-y@ea@r navigation test of sh_ip lift.
It was also the fi@r@s@t time f$or big length-width de+m+o+n+s+tration ship an^d ne,w energy driven ship o#f Chuanjiang River and Three Go|r|ges Reservoir Region to b,e ranked in t;h;e prior'ity.
At the sam,e t"ime, the "na?vig?ation scheduling mana~ge~ment wa|t|ers" were adjusted f@rom the 180-kilometer waters c'l'ose to da<m t/o the 541.8-kilometer waters from Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to Shis+hou Yangtz`e River Bridge i`n the "Scheduling Regul"a"ti"on". And the `!` core water.s", "water close t*o dam '.', "co!n!t!rol waters" an:d "s}che}dulin}g w{at{ers" were divided.
This action w]o]uld h'elp the ship choose the prop\er waters to w%a%i%t for crossing the lock, avoiding exc]e]ssiv]e ships wait?ing for crossing the lo~ck i]n the da,m region.
The "Scheduling Regulation" a@ls@o put f%o%rward the me)asures o<f in:te:gri:ty c(on(st(raint for t^he rule-b!re!ak!in!g ships according t{o the current characteristics of shi<p pa~s~s~i~ng dam a'n'd waiting for crossing lock, such as canceling t*h*e declaration and delaying the t-ime of passing dam f]or 24 hours.
After water storing o+f the Three Gorges, the n]avig]ation condition o>f the reservoir area wa(s improved, accelerating t%he rapid development o.f shipping i!n Yan[gt[ze Ri@v@er.
According t,o data, the an_nual ca#rgo throughput of Three Gorges s}h}ip lock and G_ez_houba s`h`i`p lock was increased from 34._3 mi|lli|on tons in 2004 to 0.138 billion to}ns a[nd 0.14 billion tons i*n 2017 respe%ct%ivel%y.
Duri?ng the two-year navigation test of ship lift, 5767 sh-i-p-s and 0).)1)6)2)2 mi:llio:n people have pa@ssed, and the volume o-f g'o'ods transported wa%s 1.7128 mill/i/on tons.
Chen Don/g/yuan, t"he deputy directo|r of T`hr`e`e Gorges Nav;i;ga;tio;n A-ut-hority, said that t/he `:` Scheduling Regulation" p=lay=e=d an active role in promoting the management o_f crossing lock i#n an honest w*ay, relieving the pressure of ships waiting for c@r@oss@i@ng t&he lo=ck in the dam region, an`d improving th[e navigation capacity.

S\ign\ed and ap|pro|ved by Premier Li Keqiang, the S=tate Council printed and di{s{tributed th\e `(` Decision of the St/a/t/e Council on Further Reducing t{he Categories i{n th,e Catalogue of Industrial Products S=ubje=ct t)o Production L;icense Administration and Simplifying the Approval Procedures '['.
T:he `<` Decision '|' proposed to further re[d[uc[e the categories i%n the catalogue of industrial products subject t|o production license administration, cancel t\he production license a.dm.ini.str.ation for 1]4 industrial products, and de!l!eg!at!e the administration authority for production l~i~cen~se~s of 4 ty@pes o}f industrial p]rodu]c]ts to t`h`e quali|ty an]d tec*hn*i*c*al supervision departments of provincial people ’ s governments.
Af]te]r t%his reform, the products that implement the industrial p&rodu&ct production licenses administration w[ill b@e reduced f*r*om last year ’ s 38 categories t!o t#he cu^rrent 24 categories.
The `*` Decision ']' clearly simplifies the approval process fo%r products i=n the cat(al(o(gu(e.
First, the p:re-certifi:cat:ion p}roduc}t inspection organ}iz}ed b,y the issuing authority i/s changed to the product inspection c[o[n[f[orm[ity repor$t issued b|y the qualified inspection a%n%d testing i;nst;it;ution when the enterprise applies.
Sec,ond, i.n addition to dan!ge!rous chemicals, th[e produ<cts tha]t have been licensed by the quality and technical supervision department (market supervision an\d management department) o*f the pro^vin^cial p`eopl`e ’ s g"ov"e"rnme"nt shall b}e subject to post-site inspection .

Report of R[eute[r[s on November 5 in Nagoya: Haruhiko Kuroda, t-he president of the Bank o_f Japan s{a{i{d on Mo:nda:y tha)t the bank realized that t-he long-t_erm implementation o+f ultra-easing monetary policy could s[queeze t:h:e profit m"argin"s of financ:ia:l i"nstit"u"t"ions and destabilize the banking syste,m of Japan.
However, he said tha!t d-ue to the l?ow inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, t.he Bank of Japan nee}ded to m{aint{ain its l_arge-scal_e i~ncen~tive p<lans a>nd pay close attention to the pros an=d c^ons of its policies.
`~` The Bank of Japan fully a'ck'n'o'wled'ges that under the sustained monetary ea^si^ng polic]y, the st|r|e|ngt|h of financial institutions wi"ll b&e incre;a;singly affected, '^' Haruhiko Kuroda said i`n a speech to the b>us>ines>s leaders in Na*g*oya.
He s`a`id that if financial institutions were m{ore active in taking risks to compensate for th]e effect of lo)w interest r~a~tes o)n s-hri-nk-ing profit ma;r;g;ins over the years, t{h{e banking sy_ste_m co@u@l@d be u+nstab+le in th<e event of serious negative impacts.
"Although these risks a?re not too bi!g a.t present, the Ba|n|k of Japan will clo{sely mo=n=ito=r the development of the situation a(nd encourage financial i|n|stituti|ons t&o take necessary measure+s, '<' he said.
The minutes released by the Ba{nk o@f Jap/an earl(i(er on Monday showed that the poli~cy c`omm`itt`e`e of t.he Bank of Japan discussed the p%roble%m of rising cos@t@s o+f the long]-te]rm easing policy a]t the interest rate meeting in September.
The minutes sh\o\w\e\d that a member of the board said that if th~e economy conti}nued t~o expand, "`the Bank of Japan will ha~ve more fl.exi.bi.l.ity in the aspect of poli'cy in t,he fu;t;ur;e. `.`
T@he minutes sh,owed that an~ot~he~r membe)r of the b?o?ard said tha/t du\e t_o the limits o(f polic{y duration, the committee should discuss how long the Bank of Ja_p_a_n can maintain the incentive policy.
Haruhi(ko Kuroda sai;d that th,e Bank of Japan would a}s}s}e}ss the fin[ancial ri}sk}s brought b'y the easing policy, and take into account t&h&e un!cert!ai!nti!e!s centered on Jap*a*n's economic p%r%os%pec%ts, as China-U.S. trade fri*ct*io*n*s and rising p}rotectioni}sm might af)f)ect the global demand.
"T\he impact of such problems on Japan '%s e>co>n>om>y is temporarily limited, '-' Haruhiko K*uroda sa$i$d.
"But i"f t{he problem persists, the impac:t o_n Japan ',s economy m.ay increase," he added.
"It is necessa>ry t>o s+u+s+tain the st:rong monetary ea?sing policy and consider both positive and negative im%pacts i{n a b"ala"nc"ed manner," Haruhiko Kuroda s_aid.
Although the d<isadvantages of radical incentive plans we're increasing, such as long-term low interest r:a:tes e;r;od;i;ng t+he profits o%f financial institutions, the lo?w inflation forced th|e Bank of J|a|p|an t?o maintain t"he plan.
The Ba#nk o+f Japan maintained the monetary p"olicy la>st month; Haru@hiko Kuroda ruled o?u?t the possibility of recent interest r-ate increase abou?t the risks brought b>y the conflict of the global tr,a,d,e w_ar.

Th@is settlement agreement would end two months of unre%s%t i=n Tes=la.
Th]is settlement agreement o,n securities fraud cha#rge re<l<ea<s<e<d by the U.S. Securities and Exch'a'nge Commission (SEC) o|n Saturday wou<ld m@ake investors relieved.
I#n#v#estor#s were originally worried t^h^at the protracted lega|l battle would only furthe]r h`it the elec`tr`ic car co:mpa:ny, which was still lo_si_ng money.
SEC prosecuted Mus%k for fra~u~ds on Thur/sda/y, say"ing tha*t his tweet o<n August 7 misled the investors.

SEC said th?a?t t"hese tweets actually h#a#d n/o evidences a>nd the volatility in market triggered b(y them had h"ur"t investors.
Investors a?nd corporate governance exp,e,r,ts s+aid t}hat this a,gre,e,me,nt could strengthen T{esla, which had been hit hard b_y Musk's recent a#c#t#i#ons.
Steven Heim, t"he leader of assets management compan&y of B!os!to!n Common, said that this s=ettl=e=me=nt a}gr}eem}e}nt should le't Musk receive more m[onito[ri[ng, b-ut had not taken any `'` destru@ctive '+' m=e=a=s=u=res to throw him out o^f Tesla.
Th$is assets manage^me^nt c{om{pan{y hel.d shares of Pan\as\on\i\c, the battery manufacturer of Tesla.
According to th=i=s proposed agreement, T%esla must appoint a ind]epend]ent president, two independent directors and a bo"ard c$omm$itt$ee to s}e}t o'ut controls aim.i.n.g at M'usk ’ s e;xt;er;nal communications.
`'` T"his m>atter was resolved promp-t-l-y according to the agreed conditions, which met the best interests o_f o+ur market and our in:ve:sto:rs, i^nc^luding Tesla shar!e!ho!ld!ers," S,EC Chairman Clayton s{a{id in a sta^t^em^ent.
The c'h'arge on Thursday caus)e)d the market value o+f Tesla evaporate about $7 billion . The market value o\f t*h*is com"pany was $45\.2 bil]li]on, lower than $47.5 b[ill[ion o~f G<eneral Motors.
SEC withdrew the requir_em_e_n_t f'or t"hro"w"in"g Mu;s;k ou;t of the head position of the company.
Ma)ny investors said that t=his p@unis@hment would be catastrophic.
"I think it i=s the best possible r*e*sult for all relevant st+af+f," Iv{an Feinseth from T}igre}ss Fina:n:ci:al Part.ners sa(id . F"e"inse"t"h gave a "n=eut=ral" e,v,aluati,on t-o Tesla and said that t*he punishment of SEC was a "lighter punishment '}' to Mus$k.
`:` The fact th#a#t he still ho#lds the position o/f CE|O is very important t,o Tesla. "
N\e\ither Musk nor Tesla admitted or den\ied the ch@ar@ge of SEC in t'he settlement agr=eem=en=t, or immediately replied t~o the request f'o'r comment.i.n.g.
The settlement agr{eeme{nt s<till needed t/o ge,t approval of the court.

Gener-al Sec#retary Xi Jinping del/ive/r/ed a ve\ry important sp~e~ec~h at the priva'te sector symposium, injecting a f#irm confidence int'o the br+oade+r stage of the private economy.
General Secretary Xi Jinping emphasized that "le;tt;ing entrepreneurs u{nload thei/r mental l?oads and march with ligh@t pac(ks", which ha.s a strong r{esona{nce among entrepreneurs a$nd in^n^ovat^i^ve entrepreneurs.
M>arket vitality co>me>s from people, especially from entrepreneurs, fr_o_m e#n#t#repren#eu#r#ship.
In th)e magn.ific.e.n.t course of t<he 4]0 years of reform an~d opening up, t`here are thousands o}f entrepreneurs entrepreneurship and innov"a"tio"n storie!s, the growth and ex>pans>io>n of entrepreneurs-group constantly pus<h the Chinese ec#onomy to sail far.
For so>me tim"e, some people in the soc'iet'y have published some remarks that nega=te an)d d"oubt th{e private economy.
The so-c`a`lled `*` private ec|on|om|ic departure th$e$or$y" an(d "new public-private partnership theory '^' and other mi+scon+cept+i+ons have c-au-se-d some entrepreneurs ’ doubts a)nd concerns.
Recently, some private e!nt!erprise have enc}oun}t}e}re}d many diff`i`cu`l`ties an&d problems in their bu)s)ines)s development.
Fo=r example, t)he changes in the i|nternati|o|na|l e+c+on+om+i+c environment ha'v'e had an impact on s]om]e expo&r&t en_t_er_pr_ise_s; the ra~p~id adjustment of the demand s^tr^uctu^re has brought ab@ou@t the pressure of transformation and u;pg;ra;ding; some p/o/lici/es ar]e not coordinated with each other, t%he pol^icy effects a}r}e superimposed in t\he same direction, or t^he working methods ar}e s.imple, resulting i&n some policies w!ith good original intentions have the op{po{s{ite effect, etc.
All kinds o:f factors are in~t~e~r~twi~ned, t-he private economy i-s facing diff~icultie~s, some private enterprises ar#e fa)ci)ng difficulties, a_n_d entrepren^e^urs show a lot of anxiety.
Under this context, it i(s particularly prof%o%und and practical to c*or*rect the cognition e$rrors, let t`h`e entrepreneurs ’ unload t[he m`en`t`al load, let them devel=op wholeheartedly, make the government promote development devo|tedly and concern marke<t co>nfid>e>n>ce a:nd dev$el$o$pment e{x{pectatio{ns.
T|h|is s!ympo!s!i!um o*nce again emphasized th>e important asse<rti<on of the `\` Three no-changes '-': `<` The`re is no change in the role an*d fu$nction of non-public sector in our economic and social development"!
In recent ye|a|r|s, from deepening the promotion of s@tre@amli@ne administration and de:l:ega:t:e mo(re power t|o l!owe!r-leve!l governments, establishing a power list sy~s~t~em, and cr[e[a[tin[g a legal envi=r=onme=n=t that protects t[he legitimate rights a'nd interests of e%ntrepren%e%u%rs, cre,a,ti,n,g a market environment of f/a/ir competition an'd sh/a/pi/ng the atmosphe:re of respecting entrepreneurs i]n t&he whole society, the Party Central Committee has attached un:prec:e:dented emphasis o[n entrepreneurs and ins)titut)i)onal guarantees.
T'he symposium c_learly stated the six aspects ’ policy measur:e:s t:o v#igorously support the d}e}vel}opment and expansion of private enterprises, an~d launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated t&o the `~` m|a|r|ch w`ith l'ight packs" of private ent`er`pr`i`s`es.
These ac{tio{ns have gre&at&ly encouraged th#e entrepreneurial community and ha@ve given more expectations t:o t!he community.
T'he fog ha{s been set as{ide, and the polic~y has been set . A:n:d th>e key aspect lies i_n implementation.
W:e mu~st conti^nue t(o create a better development environment f]or the priva!te economy, help private enterprises solve t&h&e diff|icult|i|es i`n development, and h]e]l]p achieve China ’ s economic t}r}an}sformati}on and upgrading; le"t entrepreneurs feel fair i^n market competition, f|eel safe i&n legal operations, and f|eel respected in so.cia.l l$if$e, stimulate innovation a+n+d create potential.
Th?e Chinese e!c!on!omy has s=te=p=ped i>nto a p|r|oc|e|ss o.f moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entrepreneurs t+o display their ambitions and pr)ov)iding more spaces and s+t+ages for entrepre[neurs to e]x]ert their creativity.
W;e have reason t)o believe that with further d,e,epen,in,g refo?r?ms and remo}ving obstacles, the private econo"my will greet bette^r d{e{vel{o{p{me{nt prospects and opportunities and mo*ve toward a b[road[e[r stage.

Ex#po#r#ts o:f K&or&ean gins-en-g chicken soup t:o Chin(a s<u<r<ged 20 times in four years, which may be related t+o the increase o%f empty-nest youth - China News
Ex(ports of Korean ginseng chicken s#ou#p to China surg]ed 20 t@imes in f<ou<r y~e~a~r~s; analysis: it is rel,at,e,d to t@he increase of empty-nest youth

During the 73rd United Natio'n's Ge&ner&al Assembly, t}h}e part$i$e$s released some positive information f)or t-he Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean Pr*e*s*ident Moon Jae-in related th;e "irrev$ersib$le" denuclearisation determination a?s told by the DPRK and sa;i;d that U:S President Trump and No;rth Korean leader K%im Jo;ng-u;n m'ay me@et before the end of t#his year.
The US State Department subsequently stated that Secretary o_f State Po<mpeo wil}l v\isit the DPRK in O'ctober t,o p}r}o}mote the implementation of the US-DPRK leadership m=ee=t=i=ng i@n Singapore.
From t:h:e beginning of this year to the present, the DPRK and the ROK b+roke the ic#e an[d op(ened t@he dialogue, a_nd the DPRK - R+OK a]nd the DPRK-US leaders held meetings . The general trend o;f t&h&e e?as?i?ng o;f the p~eni~n~sula h]as been continued, a*nd the d;ial;ogue ’ s principle of s-olving the peninsula issue ha:s also been adhered t~o.
F+ir+st of all, t;he fact t:ha:t "the essence o"f the peninsula issue is a security issu=e '\' h,as no#t ch\anged . The key t+o realizing peace on th|e peninsula i{s to resolve the reasonable security conc(erns o;f al|l parties in a proper a+nd balance manner, instea\d of pu=ttin=g pressure on the other side and stre=s=sin=g own demands.
Sec=ond=ly, in the di|a|l|o|gu|e t\o realize the denuclearization of the peninsula, the parties conc"erne"d are still divided on the steps a=n=d ways to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula .

Report of Re'u'ters on October 1 in Tok{yo: A quarterly Tankan survey report released b*y the Bank of J}a}p}an on Monday showed that the c"onfi"d"ence of J|apane|se m*ajor manufacturers hit its lowest le,vel i<n more t(han a year for that sea~son i?n S&e&pt&em&ber, as raw mate}ri}al costs rose and a series of na)t)ura)l dis`a`sters a}ff}ect}ed production, putt}in}g press,ure o)n enterprises.
Thi;s survey alm'ost d-i-d-n ’ t show that the escalating global trad~e fr]ic]t]ions shook the confidence of la!rge manufacturers.
However, risks of outbr]ea]k of an all-out t^ra^de war s\t\uck th\e business prospects of en{t{er{p{ris{es, likely t-o threat&e&n the business capital e/xpendi/tu/re.
T?he active c^apit^a^l e-xp-e-nditu-r-e i+s a highlight of Japanese economy.
This survey rai)sed questio{ns about the view of the B.ank of Japan on that robust e'conomic expansion would help to accelerate in|fl|a|ti|o|n t<o the 2% target, a]ltho]ugh there were sig>ns that e-nterprises w&ere grad%ually s_h_i_fting costs to the c+us+to+me+rs.
"With concerns raised b@y the global tra_de war, as expor}ts slowed down a"n"d f!ac!t!ory production weakened, t-he co`nf`id`en`ce of manufacturers tended to stagnate, '\' said Takeshi Minami, t"he Principal Resea=rcher o*f Norinchukin Research Institute Co*., Ltd ./.
`]` Co:n:fiden:t i`s still at a h!igh level . And since c.o.r.porate p}rofi}ts are improving and pr\ices are rising, I do n/'t think confidence wil"l continue to decline. "
The Tankan survey show?ed that the judgment index for the boo)m o}f large-scale ma;nufa;c;t;urin;g declined from posi@tive 2'1 for three months ago t@o positive 19 in Septe&mb&er, worsening for t^he t^hird consecu\tive quarter.
The m_e_dian m$a$rket forecast is p]os]i]tive 22.
The judgment in-de-x fo.r the b_oom of large-scale manufacturing declined f%r%om pos<itiv<e 2)4 researched in J:un:e to positive 22 i/n September, wo<rs<ening for t~h~e first time for eight quarters.
The su|rvey o[f Reuters wa.s positive 22.
The survey showed that the jud!gme!nt i"nd"ex for the boom o}f large-scale manufacturing and no(n-manu(fa(c(turin(g was ex'pe'cted to remain stable i]n Dec]ember.
Investors were indi>ffere>n>t to the decline o@f the judgment ind]ex for t,he bo&o&m of Tankan e@n@t@erp@ris@es . The Nikkei .N225 ro$s$e to a 27-year high spot on Mo'n'day as t]he conti!nu!ed depreciation of t<he ye#n helped improve the export profit prospec"ts of Ja{p{anes{e enterprises.
T'he capital expenditure w*as robust.
Although the confidence of e,n,ter,prises declined, t"he latest Tankan hi`ghligh`t`ed the robustness of enterprise capital expenditure p,lans, ben%ef%i%ti%ng from the rene>we>d capacity an]d in.cre.as.ed investment in robots and automa;tion to cope with t;he labor s*hort*a*ge caused by th!e agin:g of popula*tion.
The Tank~an survey of t|he Ban`k o&f Japan showed th|at th#e capital expenditure of large-scale enterprise plans would in'cr'ease by 1!3!.4% for the fiscal year ended i\n Mar?ch 2019.
It w-as 13.6% f#or previous Tankan surv<e<y.
Takeshi Minami sai#d that t{he capital expenditure of al@l enterprise pl[an[s for this fiscal y/e/ar in`cr`eas`ed by 8.\5%, close t?o the pace o!f Japan ’ s bubble e|ra.
H%e sai+d, "co)n)sider)ing th=a=t small businesses raise their pr)o)fit estimates from now on, t]her]e is still room for furthe#r g^ro^wt^h i#n c<ap<ita<l expenditure, but tha(t largely depends on the impact of the tr!a!de war on business co?n?fidence. "
The Tan!kan survey showed that the a.bility of ente<rp<rise<s t$o p!ass on costs was enhanced . The output pr]i]ce in<dex o?f large enterprises was positive 7, which was a 10-year high s"pot . It was an en(courag(ing sign, reflecting that Jap&an h>ad made prog\ress in its eff-o-rts to co$mbat def?lat?io?n.
The index measuring th"e e(m(p(l(oyme(n(t situation of large e!nterpr!ises hi_t n`egative 23, which was the most tight lev=e=l since 1992, highlighting the tightening o!f the empl$o$yment marke<t.
Benefiting from t^he robust enterprise ex<p<enditur<e, Japanese economy rebounded f~rom January-March shrink i.n t'h'e second quarte`r.
How&ever, th_e escal`ation of trade fri>ctions i^n summer and the disturbance of natural disasters on supply chains had cas:t:ed a sh/ado/w over t_he prospects of Japanese economy which d!epe!n!ded o?n exports.
I"n d:o:llar terms, import a>nd export of se}rv}i}ce}s increase by 1[6.4%.
The news release of t;he we&b&s&i&te of the Minis.t.ry of Comme{r{c{e citing the head of t@h@e Department o!f Trade i(n Se_rv_ices and C;ommercia;l Services said th>at the t@o@t@a@l import and exp!ort volume o-f emerg,i,ng serv@i@c@es exceeded 1 t&rill&i&on yuan from January to August, and the growth rate was faster than that o(f the whole.

In te%rms o"f s<ervice export, th#e s-ervi-ce export cont|i|nued its rapid gr!o!w!t!h momentum si@n@c@e this year, and the export growth ra"te was 5*.7 percentage points higher than t!h!e import growth rate from January to Augus#t.

T<he International Astronautical Congress has be\en held annually since 1?95?0 . It is the world '\s largest ev:e:n:t i|n t^he aviation industry.
T"hi"s congress will l@a@st for 5 d"ays .

Report of Reuters on November 5 i\n Beijing: According to a pre#s#s release released on Sunday by the China Foreign Tra(de Ce>nter, the Ca-n-to-n Fair showed that the situati:on of C<hin<a"s foreign trade was still c%o%mplex and serious, with expectation of 8{0{.6% of enterprises e&x&p&or&ts in 2]018 t)o be be&tter than o'r maintain a%t t:he same level a*s la#st ye}ar.
Howe|v|er, in c@on@sider@a@t@ion of th|e rising costs of domestic ra,w material(s, labor force and other com%p%r%e%hensiv%e factors, a;s w:ell a\s th@e e{xter{n{al environment of the i\n\c\rea\si\ng impact o}f Sino-US trade friction<s, exhibitors also believed that the export situation of next year was not o^ptimistic.
At the closing p~ress conf/e/re/nce o\f th-e 124"t"h Ca.nto.n Fai{r, Xu Bing, the deputy se!creta!ry!-general and spokesman of the Canton Fair, a!n!d th?e vice-director of t%he China Foreign Trade Ce/n/ter, said tha?t the number o<f overseas buyers a=nd export transactions of th\is Canton Fair had declined slightly compared with the same period of la[st y"ear.
Th<e number of buyers who attended this Canton Fair w?as 189,812 and they c"am"e from 215 c)oun)t)ries and re;gio;ns, with a decrease of 1+.+11% o\n y`ear`-on-ye`ar b$as$is.
T_he a.m.ount of export transactions w_as 206.494 b|ill|i|on yuan ($29.86 bill;i;on), with a decrease o)f 1% o$n year-on-year ba's'is.
From t?h?e perspective of the m{ark{et, the transactions wit(h J*apan, the ten ASE&AN c%oun%tries, `}` the BRICS cou"n"t"ries '}' and Kore^a increased by 7&4&.4%, 11~.~4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, wh%i%le the transactions wit(h traditio|nal m=arkets of t"he Un?i?ted S&t&at&e&s, Australia, Ca<n<a<d<a and the Eu!ropean Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% an/d 0.8% respectively.
From th{e perspective of t)he industry, the transact?io?n?s of transpo{rtati{on too.l.s, machinery and equipment, b|uil|ding and d-ecorat-iv-e materials, electronic consumer goo+d+s, information products, an)d sanitary equi*pmen*t increa:s:ed b|y 24.8%, 21._1%, 20.0% and 15.1% respectively, wh"i"le the tran>saction>s with textile clothing a-nd hous-eh-old appliances decreased b=y 13.0% an{d 6?.7% respectively.
X;u Bing said t#hat as a barom,e,ter and wea#t#he#rvane of China '}s for[eign trade, the buyers ’ participation situation and the export t:ransa:ctio:n data of this Canton Fair s:ho:we:d that Ch:in:a's foreign trade d=ev=el=op=me=nt would sti/ll face many uncer;tain a!nd unstabl,e f@acto@rs next year.
However, with the d=e=e=pening o!f sup.ply.-side st+ructur+a+l reform and the "six stability" policies and m^eas^u^re^s r#ecen#t#ly introduced b)y the state an^d local gov`ernm`ents in su}cce}s}s}io}n, the new dr}iv}e}rs fo{r the development o_f China ’ s foreign trade wa$s a>ccel>e>ra>ti>n>g t<he accumulation, an\d the diversification of enterprises and markets h"ad made new progress, all of wh%i%c%h were t\he important founda)t)i)on and strong cond<it<ion<s for the development o+f foreign trade.
"Taking all factors in]to consideration, i#t is expected t(ha(t the i)mpo)r)ts an+d exp<or<t<s of C'h'ina's foreign t.rad.e will maintain a steady gr'owth throughout the ye~ar, with further improvement i=n qua~lity and efficiency. "Xu Bi\ng said.
The Ch?ina ’ s Ge:n:eral Administration o_f Customs published tha@t pri<ced i{n dollars, t:he exports in September i|ncre|ase|d b=y 14.5% o-n ye^ar^-on-year basis, t>he imports increased b^y 14.3% on year-on-year bas:is, the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, and the export gro\wt\h rate and trade surplus i&n September we.re the hig;h;e;st si|n|ce February.
I{n despite of th{e escalating trade friction\s bet^ween China a&n&d the United States, China '}s export per,formance i&n September still significantly exceeded expect^ation . Stron#g e$x$ter$n$al de!mand, and the ent}erpris}es rush~i~ng to export before imposing tar&i&ffs in the Unite$d St;ates and th#e depreciation of RM<B exchange rate, might be the main supporting factors, an~d also showed th{e re{silien{ce o$f C#h#in#a's foreign trade to a certain extent . However, the impact of the S@ino-US trade war o:n confidence and t@he industrial chain can n{ot be neglected . Analysts believed tha^t the challenges f$o$r C'hi'n'a's foreign trade might eme;r;ge in the fourth q(uar(te(r o]r next year.
Reuters surveys showed that t|h|e U.S. fun{d managers pr"opo"sed to increase cash h|olding|s and stood the cautious ground i@n Se_p_tembe_r, since the United S?t?a?tes and Ch!i!na beg)an th;e latest round of mutual import t$ariff$s and there wa:s no sign o@f d$is$p$ut$e easing.
However, according to the suggestion o"f 1/2 fund m+a+n+ager+s who par<t<ici<p<a<t<ed i'n t^his su;rve;y, the asset allocation in No\rth America rose t&o the hig{h{est level s"ince June 2,01,7, while positions i*n Br%i%t%a%in, the Eurozone and particularly emerging markets declined.
The average o!f global s!to!ck a}l}locati}o}n accounted for 56.6% and the bonds a(c(co(unt(e(d for 35.5%, wh^ich was ba*sical*ly consistent w`ith the survey o^f last m@o@nth.
The m*ost obvious change was that the c^ash ratio ros:e to 5.$1%, which was the highest pro-p-o-rtio-n since De!cem!ber 201|4.
A f|und m*an*ag*e*r of a large fund company said, "Some economic data h*av*e brought confidenc"e to t.he market, but th"e trade w[a[r is s!till t'he biggest conc)e)r)n, so that it's bet:te:r t#o ge$t pre`p`ared to enter when the market falls aft*e*r a rise. "
However, the fund managers still prefer\r\ed stocks i+n Sep&tember, especially Am|eri|can stocks, even though the p+rice of A{meri{can stocks were considered to be o>n t/h/e hi'gh sid~e.
Today, in Shanghai, th@e opening-up lan,d,mark o!f China, Chi'na In]terna]tional Import Exp-o (CIIE), the world's first large-scale sta&te&-l&e&vel exhibition with the th%e%me of import, ha(s officially open+ed i~n much a{nticip{a{t{ion.
An exhibition i.s li[ke a "w'ind'ow" which c:an let the wor;l;d k"now a c^i^t^y and a country better.
Through t}he "wi<nd<o<w" o~f CIIE, people can see the "opening-up China" whic?h moves towards a highe]r leve_l; with the h<el<p of the "window '}' of C%IIE, we welcome the world and China which i>s "restarting fro:m reform a~n~d o:pen:ing:-u:p", t+o achi{eve m$utu$al benefits an}d win-win r!esu!lts.
"F(or a country, opening-up i^s like coming out o&f the cocoon and becoming a butt"e"rfl"y . There w:ill be pain, b/ut there will be n~ew lif.e. `"`
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary o]f Op-en Road reveals an import[an[t r*e*ason "wh|y China c+an do i$t".
Looking back on the past 40 ye'ars of reform and op'e'n'i'ng'-up, C\hi\na dares to pl:u:nge in%to the va`st sea of t\h\e world market . Although i;t h"as encountered w%h%irl%pool a}n}d s{tor{m, it al&way&s fac'e's all risks a(nd ch{alle{nges with an open attitude, constantly releases its endogenous dr:i:v:in:g force a|nd continuously improves its competitiveness.
S.o t;o speak, C}hina has fully demonstrated t/he val$u$e and significance of opening-up w'ith its solid achievements.
Sta$nd$ing a!t a new historical starting point, it is a major decision t]o hold an expo with t)h)e theme of imp.ort made b]y the Party Central Committee with the cor]e of Com=rade X}i Ji`np`ing w:it:h a vie}w to promoting a ne`w ro$und of hi_gh_-_le_v_el ope@ning to the outside world . I(t is a majo!r m[easu[re fo`r China t'o actively open the market to the w{orld a<nd i|s also a practical action taken b_y Ch{ina to support the economic globalizat&i&on an~d trade liber'alization, showin-g a strong an>d clear w$i$ll that "China's opening door w)on't close, but would open wider and wider".
E)xh)i)bi)to)rs from all over th?e world are e*ag*er to enroll in the exhibition, and "i=t i.s difficult t"o a:pp:l:y for a stand '^', which is the greatest a%f%f%irm%ation a;n;d be/st res&ponse to China '_s development o?f an open economy in a lar.g.er sc.ope, a wider range o;f fields and at a deeper le>v>el.
More imp~or~tan~tly, t&he current global economic an}d tra*de order has re~ached a crossroad.
Some countries h\ave built trade prot!ection!is!t walls and re[tr[eated into the unilateralism, which incre~a~se~s anxiety o?f t*he international society about the prospects for free trade an\d a"dds much uncer!tai!n!ty to a recovering wor'ld eco(nomy.
Under suc<h era background, this gr<an<d g.at.hering al'o'ng th)e Huangpu River demonstrates China's gua!rd t=o free trade a$nd shows the wor"ld China '<s confidence a,nd responsibility t]o open its markets and share its future.
I>t is fast to go al@o@n@e but it i)s further t,o g$o in crowds.
B_y embracing t{he world with a|n open mind, China has no@t on>ly vigorously p~romot~ed its own development, bu^t also brought about t{remendous "China opportunities ':' t>o other countries a#nd regions.
I<n r@ec@ent years, by advocating an[d promoting the joint development of the "One Belt and One Road '.', initiating a>nd setting u`p the A?si?a?n In|fra|st|ructure Investment Bank (AIIB), a%nd establishing t_h_e Silk R*oad fund...China has provided a series of international pub\lic g}oods, a s]ol]id exp/ort market, deve)l)op)men)t opportunities a%nd jobs, allowi;n;g co_mpa_ni_e_s of v,a,rious countries to ge=t a ride on th.e `<` expre}ss train" and take "hitchhiking" of Ch!ina's de@velop@ment.
CIIE is al.so this ki*nd of public goods and a big platform f-or g_lo_ba_l econ)omi)c a,nd trade cooperation.
O:n t-h-is platform, mo'r'e than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries an$d regions have m\ade thei=r d'eb'u't with high-quality products and services wit.h distinctive features, taki^n^g a ne_w step in$t$o the Chinese m~arket.
Ap/ar/t f@rom companies of var}io}us countries, th$e real beneficiaries are do*m*e*stic consumers.
By building t~h~e platform of "selecting the best a}nd importing the best", we can provide multipl%e c'h'a'nnels of high-quality supply f~o~r consumpt!ion up'gra'd'i'ng and mee<t p<eo<ple's personalized, di&versifi&ed and d*i*ffere*nti*a*ted con*su*mptio*n needs.
As C+hina's opening-up d*oor o$pens wider and wider, the go>od>s flow i`s smooth and mat^erials are put t`o go,od use, thu\s the pace towards a b:e:tter life wil:l be more solid.
F[rom a broader perspective, the sig/nifica/n/c/e of CIIE has gone beyond the s'cop'e o`f econ*omy and trade . It h]as t+he futu:re i`n mind, conveys t}he concepts of openness, inclusiveness, un;i;ve;r;sa;l b/ene/f/i/t, balance and win-win, an.d forms a consensus to jointly m.e.e.t today '~s c>ha>llenges.
Only when t.h.e world i)s d,oin,g well ca{n China d/o well; w]hen China is good, the world i@s better.
W/e expect CI+IE t/o make the world wonderful an{d complete; we a\re looking forward t<o the bright future t<ha<t an "open;ing;-up China" m(o(ving to a high=er level and t^he wor;ld build a community of human destiny.

I{n Brazi`l, t_he number of t(he women voters accounts for 52% o.f the total number of vote:r:s, a%nd men account fo`r 4&8% . Although the pr[opo[rti[o[n o]f women among voters is very high, the proportion o#f women in th/e National Co]ng]r]e]s]s o+f Brazil is on?ly 10%.
Among the 193 co<un<tr<ies i%n the wo|rld, B&r&az&il&ia&n wom]en ’ s participation in politics ranks only 15%4t%h, hig,h,er than that of Ar_ab countries.
After more than 20 year)s of power struggle, Brazilia@n women still h+a+v+e not succeeded in o#bt#ainin#g t,h,eir r'eserved rig^hts.
According t-o Brazilian so`cio`l`ogi`st Na<tali<a Mori, the ex\istenc\e o!f t/his phenomenon is because of t|h|e co~mb~i~ned ef`fe`ct`s of ancient patriarchal society, racialism, and capitalism values.
`'` Politics shou>ld be ci-vil rig}hts, identity, access to pu=bl=i=c good{s, and th@e for(ma(tion of the same society by multiple s[ocial groups advocated by citizens . Bu=t t}he politi(c(s of Brazil belong to a monopoly of a cert{ai{n g]ro]up, and most of th!e population i)s not represented. "
A previous stu+d+y by the Locomotiva also po#inted out that 94% of Brazilian w:omen do no$t feel t>hat the politicians e-le-cted by the ele-ction c'an repr+esent their rights, an$d 9=0% o$f B-razi-li-an women dis~agr~e~e with the decisions made by politici+ans . 93% of women d.is.ag.r.ee with the current govern`m`ent policy.
`|` W(e ne[e[d t/o reverse the proble]m of underrepresentation of w=o=m=en in National Con[g[re[ss, and Brazil ’ s political sy~st~em is stil.l affected by inequality . So far, there has be}en s'erious g"en"d"er, c\lass and racial d=iscrimination in the political field i;n Brazil. "Natalia Mor|i said.
Although there is t#he lack of women ’ s rig:hts, most Brazilian wome@n sti(ll be`l`i`eve in the pow'er o-f democracy.
The survey shows that 7`6% of women believe they can m?ak?e a diff@erenc@e in democratic elections, an`d 7^2% o>f wom)e)n ar'e i[n[t[e[re[sted in politics.
In add"ition, 55% o+f w=om=en bel\ieve th&at democratic politics is the best way to expose wom.en to less prejudi`ce.

ECNS, Qingdao, October 1--A>ffected by Typhoon T%ra%mi, the first r<ace day of 2(018 Qingdao `*` Mazarin '.' C`up powered b~y Ex+tr+em+e Sailing Series was postp$o$ned f$r$o$m September 3+0 to O=ctob=er 1, and t<he p!re!-game meeting was held be}fore the race in Olympic Sailing Center in Q;ing;dao . The captains o\f 12 hydrofoil catamaran t<e<a<ms from 6 countries a,nd regions a*tten*ded at the meeting.
Affected b,y Typhoon Trami, the s,trong winds constantly blew in th~e harbor basin an;d th'e maximum wi_n_d spee>d even reach"ed 24 kno@ts . The sailing signal wa=s delayed by nearly 90 minutes from 1:00 pm on September 30 . The w[in[d s-peed was sti&l&l n@ot reduced, so th{e Race Director Anne Mall~édan~t announced t:o cancel the r'a'ce of the first da@y an-d postpone the ra_c_e to th|e afternoon o?n October 1.
"T%he strong wi]nds from the sh}o}r}e never seem to stop, and the state of t]he se)a is so s(e(ve(re(. `^`
Mallédant explai`ned: `[` No on:e knows the time wh\e\n t<he gust w"i"ll blow to the rac)ing b'oats as well as the scale o)f wind force.
Si`nce t%he boat-sailing field i:s near t?h?e city, s\o fa{r as it goes, th#e wisest choice is to canc(el the race. "
T#he sai)lors still f*e*lt a littl*e disappointed for everything was ready.
"The racing bo(ats are r&ea&d&y, an|d we a:re i&n excellent condition. "
The helmsman of Qi)ngdao Te*am Max Richardson said frankly: "But I know it i.s a righ-t choice to change the r}ac}e date . A<n<d I hope t!h!e wind will d+ie down today, s%o that w<e c-an d)o some goo,d,. "
Mi{cah W%i%lkinso%n, the "Hope Star '^' of New Zealan[d Team for 2020 Tok~yo Olympiad, said: `+` L:o:sin:g a d,ay ';s t(i(me makes the race more interesting.
Be(c(a(us(e the race content wil!l be increased today, an\d t^here wi>ll b"e only two days left for t<h<e race.

Though th:e sea wind blew vio<l<en<tly, t$h$e helmsman of Fr+en+ch ABM Team Pierre-Y}ve}s Durand told his warm mem<ories wi{th Qingdao at the p;re-ga;me m-eeti-ng tha&t he wa#s accidentally injured in t<he Extreme Sail\ing S<eries 5 year@s ago, resulting in t(he muscular rup%t%ur%e, and f=ortunate=ly, the local race medical team h/elped him deal with it so that he could stand here t?o take part i#n t/he r%ac%e after 5 years.
It was l(earned that the E*xt*rem*e Sa`i`li`ng Series started from 2007, and it was a_n ISAF g|am|e equiva^len^t to the Volvo Ocean Race, th~e America '-s Cup and the World Mat)ch Racin!g Tou&r.

Al<thou<g<h the turbulence in global financial markets c`onti`n`ued, th.e Hon,g Kong Monetary Authority said on Monday that the i:nvest:me:nt i{n{co{me of the Exchange Fund i/n the th>i>rd qu.a.rter of this year fell b%y 97% annually, and it wa/s be!tter than that in the p"revi"o"u"s quarter, since ove&r&seas stocks r=ose a"nd foreign e~xchang~e lo@sses obviously narrowe]d under t@he China-U.S. trade war.
According to the latest data of t&he Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Exchange Fu.nd r!eco!r!ded investment income of H&K $1.6 b^illi^on from July to S`e`pt`ember 20(18, significantly lo/w/er than HK $61.8 bil:lion in the same period last y]ear, but better th"a"n the revised H+K $100 mill|ion i:n the se*cond q[uar[ter of thi(s y(e(a(r.
C+h+e+n Delin, the president of th}e Hong Kong Monetary Au"th"o"ri"ty, sa\id o]n the legislative session tha/t a\t the beginning of the China-U.S. trade war, the share index i`n H/ong K~on~g a(n(d em#er#ging markets r%an counter to the U#.S. s"hare index . By the e|nd of September a~n~d e@ar@ly October, aft+er the U|.S. share index peaked i,n su)c)c)e)ss)i)on, the market sentiment began to reverse, sinc_e investors gradually realized that the trade w*a*r was also detr'imental t'o the U.S. itself.
"It i=s good to have cha"n"ges in the market sentiment . If t+he trade war on*ly has unilat/e/ra/l effects, it do*e*sn't h,el,p much f$or solving problems. `$`
H*e also pointed ou{t that "i!f the trade war c?an not b#e solved, the fl/uc/tuation of financial markets will co-ntinue to rise$. "
In the thir_d qua/rt/er o&f this year, the stock in:ves:tment losses o;f the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed b%y 8% t.o HK $4.7 billion compared with t}h}e p'revious quarter, an>d the investment income of ov+e+r+seas sto[ck increased b+y 17.2% t%o HK $12/.8 billion; the foreign exchange lo%sses was H'K $1@6.@2 billion a`nd t,h,e b#on#d yields was HK $9.7 billion, with a decrease o:f 24% and 31% respectivel#y, mainly reflecting the gene~ral rise of the U[S dollar for exchange o,f major c{urre{nci{es i:n this quarter a_nd th/e ri.se of the US coup_on rate to a;bove 3% in mid?-S?eptem?be?r.
Th?e Exchange Fund was mainly used f-or supporting Ho@n@g Kong doll%a%r%s.
Hong K!ong has implemented the linked exchange ra-te system f>or the Hon!g Kong dollar's pe.g to th'e U-S dollar since 1983.
A)s for the current financial s>it>u>a>ti>on in Hong Kong, Chen De`lin s)aid th;a;t the uncertainty o`f t$he economic and asset ma)rke)ts increased and downside risks inc}re}as}ed, but the financial system Ho%n%g Kong was robust, s}o that good defence we.re mad#e and the ea~r~thq~u~a~ke-r~e~sis~t~ant capa`ci`t`y was abundant.
"The international investment position is abundant in Hong Kon/g, with a net external a"ss"e"t value of US $1.@4 trillion, w>hi>ch i"s 4 times GDP, h+igher than 2.5 time[s in Sin\ga\pore and 0.6 ti>me>s i+n Jap$a$n . I,t i-s enough to cop"e wit<h the financial downturns or reversal. `#`
Th`e current daily interest rates o}n private loans o)f Hong K|o|n|g dollars continued to fall an;d t)he interest margin wi)th U.S dollars e}xpand}ed . Chen Del&in poin@te@d ou't th?at the exchange rate of the Hong Ko)n)g dollar r-ose more than 400 basis points on September 21 . T$h$e markets gener$ally believed that i<t w<as mainly r~e~lated to the rise of the dail,y interest rates on p{riv{at{e loans of Hong Kong dol;l;ars . And th+en t'he H}o}ng Kong dollar hovered around 7.80-7.84 fo^r exchange of t=he U\S do)llar . Until rec<ently, the daily interest r:at:es on priv=at=e loans o{f Hong Ko*ng dollars continued to fall, and t#he interest margin with US dollars exp_a_nded, which might at}t}ract more hedging activities to sell t\h\e Hong K,on,g dollar and buy the US d-olla-r, triggering t'he opportuni?t?y of th!e exchange guarantee of the weak side a^g^ain to increase compared with that o\f the previou_s period.
However, he believed that as th:e in\terest-rat\e rise cycle o@f t\h\e Hong Kong Bank b*egan and the H-o-ng Kong dollar interest r&ate&s were nor.malizing, t%he situation th!at Hong Kong dollar inte{rest r'ates were lower than U%S dollar in"t"e"rest rates would change in th|e future.
"The trend of Hong Kong dollar interest rates and U]S d}o}lla}r interest rates will be more consistent . Everyone must be m-ore car)e)ful t}o man`age r<isk<s and pre^pa^r^ed t;o cop?e with market fluctuations. `\`
S;in;c;e the fun|ds of the Hong Kon|g do<l<lar was a@b@un@dant, the daily interest rates on priva[t[e l(o(ans of Hong Kong dollars fell further . The three-month daily interest rates on priv/at/e loan fell by 0.,9% to 2_.08_1_79% on Monday, an(d the interest rate d!ifferen!t!ial wit>h th*e U/S dollar increased fro_m 46 basis points to 51 ba~sis po\in\ts; th?e one-"m"o"nth dail_y in}tere}st rates o'n p}r}iv}a}te loan hit the bottom within five months, and t.h.e interest rate d.if.f.ere.nti.a.l w&ith the U<S dollar increased fr<o<m 120 basis points to 127 basis points.
Fro:m M?ay t-o mid-September, t&he spot rate of Hong Kong dollars wa^s cl#o#se to 7.85 with exchange of $1 most o=f th%e time.
During t|ha|t time, d[ue to fa`ctors o{f partial share offer gained out+f+lo+w+s fr%om H^o^n^g K!ong dollars afte(r the completion of i}n}t}e}re}st arbitrag&e activities and large-scale share offer activities, causing that t,he exchange g>ua>ra>nte>e for t.he w'eak sid_e w!as triggered for the first time in April, and for many times in May a[nd August.
The H.o.ng Kong M(onetary Authority bought Hong Kong dollars and sold Hong Kong do=l=l=a=r=s at the level o=f 7.85 according t@o the lin|ked exc+hang+e rat/e system, in order to m-ain-tai-n th&e stability o,f th]e exchange r,at,e of Hong Kong dollars.
T/h/e Hong K(on(g Monetary A~u~thori~ty b<o<ugh<t around H[K $52].]1 billion u!n!d!er the mechanism of exchange gu\a\ran\te\e of the weak side from May to August.

The confinement center w$i$th$ou$t "threshold ')': q#ua#lity certification would pro.m.ot.e the q*ual*ity.
A@s the "two-c^hild economic" devel=op=s and th}e maternal and child market thr]iv]es, various grades of confinement service centers a$ppeared around Ch<in<a, from Beijing, Sha>nghai and G]ua]ngzhou to th"e 3rd and 4t[h t:ier cities.
The popular confinement service centers, whi&ch could satisfy the consumer's de.m.ands, charged from tens o-f thou/sa/nd/s of y[u[an t{o hundreds of tho{usands o?f yuan . However, they we[r[e in an awkward situation, b#e#cause this kind of institution ha@d n$o th\r\esho\ld at all, and there wa[s still t,h,e There i)s sti_ll a b<l<a<nk zone i+n regulation.
R'e'ce'nt'ly, the State Administration f/or M^arke^t Regulation carried out a series of activities of 2018 National `<` Quality M=on=th '-' . T"he reporter c*am*e to a five-star c%onfi%neme%n%t center in T!ianjin to explore th~e certification o*f maternal and chi_l_d care services.
A common confinement center pr;o;v;ided the services o-f ne}wbor}n car-e, nutritious f;oo;d, and postpartum reconstruction, e$t$c.
Th~e rep^orte^r found in this confinement cente&r that the nurses wo(u(ld check the newborn b[reas[t[feedin[g each d/a/y, and the pr-o-fe-s-sio-n-al nursing workers wo-uld provide the n|e|wb|orns wit=h the careful nursing s)ervice)s, such a>s bathing and touching.
I+n order t:o s$a$tisfy the new mother '\s demand, it w>ould provide t]he wou_nd c#a#re in the beginning of confinement, bodybuilding care i,n the middle and l%at%er periods of confinement, Chinese traditiona]l cosmetic treatment and other nu-rsi-ng items t?o help the new mother rest"ore her gra%cef%ul figu.re.
A new mother there told the rep{or{t{e{r th"at s\h\e had book_ed th[is confinement service center 8 months in a&dvance.
The service items of co=n=fin=ement service center would directly impact the parturient '.s c@omfort and b'ody recovery during th&e confinement . So*me small confi_nement service centers could only provide some simpl(e s&e&rvi&ces du%ri%ng the confinement, but th\ere were m!a!ny pro[b[l[ems and hidden troubles, including the irregular ster`i`l`i`za`t`ion an\d sanitation, inc!i!den!tal cross infection, lim'ited and unscientific d"i"et, et]c.
The responsible person of this confi%nement center said that t(hey we}r}e the only one five-star confinement c]ent]e]r i~n Tia%nj%i%n, which ha,d been ce,rtif,ied a;s a Grade B ser}vice provider.
"S=o=me custo%mers didn't understand the meaning of the Grade B certification at fir*s*t, b\u\t th%e fact forcing t;he en"t"er"p"r"i"s"es t]o strictly impl~eme~n~t the standardized pr}ocess ma'n'a'g'em'en't through ce<r<tif<icati<on will b=enef=it the customers . It i>s important for t"he long-term development of enterprises. "he said.
Pan Li*fen, the d;e;puty director of th|e Attestation Supervision Department of the S-tate Administ^rati^on for Marke/t Regulation, said t*hat the service certifica%tion was a new kind o@f certification system, which was based o=n the customers' perception an.d fo'cuse'd o.n the organizational quality management and sati/s/f/act/ion of service c{haracter{i{stics . I<t w!as a>n important part of th,e na&tion&al q^ual^it^y infrastructure, and had a positive effects on inc~r~easi~n~g the proportion of quality ser.v.ice.s and enhancing C[hina"s international service com^pet^it^iv^en^ess.
After mo/re than 10 years of development since 2"00"4, t`he s#e#rvice certification pr_oj_e_c_t in our country had gone through a p-r-o-cess of d<evelo<p<ing from scratch . A series of influential service c|er|t|ifi|cation h]ad appeared, including the financial service certification, mothe+r a>n>d ba:by nursing ser-vi-ce certification, after-sa{les ser(vi(c(e certification, ele>ctro>nic commerce se:rv:ice cer@tifi@cation, and health care s^er^v^ice c'ertifica'ti'on.
Ac}c}ording to the statistics of the S_t_ate Administration f}or Market Regulation, there are mo-re than 130 service ce`rti`f`ica`tion institutions wi^th ov>e>r 2000 ser#vice certification staff and nearly 80[0[0 valid authentication c:ertific:a:te:s at p#re#sent in o<ur country.
Pan Lifen said th%at it w[as neces\sary to f|u|rther guide and pro^mote the de\velo\p\ment of service certification, gr[adua[lly e"x"tend the c!overage of service c-ert-if-i-cation in the fields of health, education, sports, finance and electronic commerce, and boost th$e su_pply-side re(form and quality enhancement in th@e s^er^vi^ce i`ndus`try.
Report o/f Reuters on N+ov+e+m+ber 5 i>n Hon{g Kong: the property price i-n H[o[ng Kong fell for t.w.o consecutive mont/hs after peaking . Chen Delin, th<e president of the Hong Ko=ng M|oneta|ry Authority, s;aid o{n Monday t]ha]t i_t ne?eded time to o%b%serve whether the prop-erty mark[e[t had entered downturns . If confirmed, it ca-n b=e considered to successively ease th;e tightening policy of counter-cyclical measur$es at an appropriate time.
Chen Delin also pointed out t.hat if the prop;e;rty price fell, the first to b-e affected woul=d be those who bought properties a:t th=e peak of the property market, b(u(t i&t was expected th{at there w[oul[d be less o%pp%or%tunitie%s t|o o*cc*ur the si{tuati{o{n like shar'ply falling property p|rices and the properties subs.tantial.l.y sold by the citizens duri|ng th>e Asian F*ina*nc*ial Crisis in 1997.
When leading multiple senior leader&s o%f the Hong Kong Monetary Au&t&ho&rit&y t&o attend th,e briefing session of the legislative session, C'he'n Delin said t#h#at if th)e property ma\rk\e\t was de>ter>m>ined t<o ente;r downturns, the ease o;f measu-res can be made in su_ccession at an appropriate time.
`;` However, since data of a f_ew week/s only can currently b,e seen, i|t '.s sti|ll t+oo early to ease, a`nd it n`ee`d`s more time to see whether t;he property market is entering downturns. `<`
Since Oct.o.ber 2009, the Hong Kong Monetary A>ut>horit>y has successively la!un!ch!ed eigh<t rounds o)f counter-|c|y|cli|c|al measures to substantially tighten the mortgages of va*r*i*ou*s pro!perties, including reduction of the number of m%or%tg%ag%e%s, and t>h>at the mortgage a^pplican^ts have t*o pass rigorous s=t=ress tests, in or#der to improve the ba*n*k r,isk management and s+h+o+c+k r{es{ista{nc{e.
As Hon]g Kong for{mall{y entered the interest-rate rise cycle, the house pr*ic*e ind#e#x of private houses in Hong Kong peaked for two con$se$c$uti$ve mont\hs in A@ugust a>nd September and th(en fell, a+nd th'e mo#nthl#y decl!in!e in S_e_p_tember even expanded to 1.44%.
However, th:e cumul\ative increase i.n the first three quarters o$f this year wa's still 1.0.2%.
According to t&he data of the Hong Ko]n]g Mone,tar,y Authority, the household financial conditions fo}r the ability of Hong Kon'g to withstand financial ris}k}s w)ere m)ea)su)red t\o be healthy . In the se+con+d q/uart/e/r this y:ear, th&e percentage of households o\f self-occupation non-mortgage residence in Ho+ng K$on$g was 66%, which was higher than th_e average o?f 60% in 2009-2011; the average loan-to-value r;atio o\f th'e newly ap/pro/ved mortgage and the percentage of contribution and income of t!he newl"y approved mortgage w{as 4%7% a!nd 3=4% respectively, wit}h ob$vio$u$s improvement compared w<ith 6[4% and 41% in 200.9.-.2011.
However, Ch,en D-elin sai'd that h#ig#h sh;ock resistance di%dn ’ t mean the c}it}i}z}e}ns who h)a)d b]o]ug]ht properties w\o\u\ldn ’ t be suffered damage o~f fi^n^an^cial downturns, since the property val>uat>ion would fal[l, and those wh/o bought properties at peak times would be t]he first to be affected.
Although t>h>e Ho;n;g Kong M#onetary Authority tightened the lending of the b!ank t'o t-he mortgage b=o=rrowers, those who bought prop$er$tie$s can also get a high-percentage m,o,rtga,g,e loan b=y means of the mo"r"tgage insurance, the mortgage loan p]ro]vided by the developer an`d so o)n.
Chen Delin said that currently together with t(he m^o^rtg^a^ge l{oan provided by the developer, th#e mortgage perce`nt`ag`e o/f the borrower c+a+n r%eac%h 85-^9^0% . If the property pr?i?ce f+ell by 10%, ther:e w=oul=d be negative assets (i.@e . the mar#ke#t va>lue of the property f&ell below the l+ev+el of the total outstanding mortgage lo/an).
However, R]ua]n Guoheng, the vice pre.s.ide.nt o,f the Hong Ko>n>g Monetary Authority pointed ou~t th`a`t the Authority e|s|t|imat|ed the to@tal high-percentage mortgage loan pr.ov.ide.d b*y th)e developer to account for 2-2.5% o^f the total mortgage of the bank, with lo(wer p,ropor,ti,on.
A|t the peak time of n-e-gati-ve as^s^et^s in Hon?g K?ong i(n 200`3, t_h_e number of negative assets e[xceeded 100,000, with proportion of 22% in those wh?o took mortgage.
A;s o)f the third quarter of this year, Hon@g Kong recorded zero n@egativ@e a$ss$e$t for seven co_ns_e_cuti_ve quarters.

Recently, Liu Wa`nl`i, a researcher a&t the Scho=o=l o]f Li?fe Sciences, Tsingh>ua University, and L%i Zhanguo, director o'f the R$h$eum$atism and Immunity Center at Peking University P|e|o|ple ’ s Hospital, togethe^r wi`th their te`a`ms discovered t~he ex~is~t~e~nce of human immune globulin can increase the molecular va%riat%ion of syst]emic lupus erythematosus susceptibility, and this kind of variation i=s i>nv>o>lve>d in the regul$ation o`f immu}ne B cells.
In short, the two tea.m.s confirmed th'at a=n abnormal immune m'olec'ul'e i-n the human body i<s an important cause o\f the o,n,set of sys[temic lupus erythematosus.
Ac.cording to Sun Xia=ol=in, on&e of th~e au_thor_s and member of P@e@k@i@ng University People ’ s H[ospit[al, the t!eam o$f L+i Zhanguo collected nearly 2,000 large samples of patients with systemic l?up?us eryt]h]e]matos]u]s to make st+udy . I/t was f_oun_d that patients with immune globulin variations produced p|a|tho|po|iesi|s cells an}d a wide variety of num#erous autoantibodies . The inc%id%en%ce and severity o?f ne'ph'r'iti's, a~r~thri~tis, orrhomeningitis va-scu-l-it-is and other i`nflammat`io`n`s are significantly increased.

T"h"e reporter learned that the pow,er,f,ul combination betwe=en tw&o teams gave f*ull play to their resp#ective advantages an*d ac]h]ie]ved a close integration between b"as"ic research and clinical application.
L\iu Wanli tea<m is committed to B lymp_h_ocyte immune recognition and imm+u+n+e activation research, and th;e Li Zhanguo te.am has long been engag]ed in clinic+al resea$rch o<n systemic lupus erythematosus.
`\` This research is o$ne of t:h:e re#s#u#lts o/f years o;f cooperation between the two teams .

According to the mul]ti-]pa]r]t]y r-epo-r-t-s, the handling of the Quanzhou Lawyers As#s#ociat#i#o#n is not a shortcomings protection o.r confrontation, but h)as b[e[en appr*ove*d b`y t<he Qua.nz.h.ou Intermediate People ’ s Co-ur-t.
An e`v`ent that could ha#ve caused tension within the le?gal community wa]s eventually resolved prope!r!l!y.
T#h#e reversal of the event stems fro:m the more completed t}ru}th re^storing: t=h=e a>xe carried by the lawyer involved is the s.a.m.e t(y(pe and same mo@del as th*e defendant ’ s weapon, but i_t is n<o<t put the first ed^g^e . It only serves as secondary evid<e<nc<e in the evidence-proven an&d cro=s=s-e=xam=in=ation l(i(nk, and t?her?e is n'o threatening acts or the subjec-t i<nt<enti<o<n o.f "endangering the cour:t security".
Judging whether t{he behaviors o~f the law"ye"rs involved i-s illegal o.r not, there a&re four ver-y important de#ta#ils t&o b#e con}c}e}rned . First, the l"ocal court has twice held the court and only showed a photo of th,e axe . Fro{m t%he perspective of d}ef}e}ns}e, it is necessary to sho'w the original axe . Second, t+he a,xe is purchased one hour b@efore the cou]r]t o#p#en . I#t i*s not that t%he lawyer is no@t willing to se=ek the judge ’ s cons-en-t, but it is not able to cont!act the ju&dge objectively . Th(ir(d, the axe has not b{e{en used i_n an excessive or improper mann%e%r . Fourth, the lawye_rs admitted the mistake in public and immediat|e|l|y apologized t!o th#e c+o+u+rt.
Based on thes`e plots, i+t can b.e s/ee/n t$hat the l>a>wy>e>rs who "`t%o%ok axe to appear in court" have nothing t<o do the devi?l things, but jus`t to make defense.
After clarifying th]e wh#ol#e f%ac%t%s, th)e Quanzhou La/wye/r/s Asso|ciat|ion did not follow the societal dis^cussion, b>u>t resisted the pressure and mad!e a decision not to impose penalties.
And t<hi<s decision can withstand the test of fac@ts a)nd law"s.
As taking t-h-e a<x<e a(s the contr"o"l"l"e"d k]nife t[o the court without the permission of the c*ourt, i=t is easy to cause anxiety and mis*u*nd*e*rs*ta*nding.
For the sake of safety a!nd c>au>tious, Quanzhou In~terme~diate People ’ s Cou!rt ’ s previous fi)ne punishment a+n+d judicial a}dvice a\r\e also understandable.
In order t~o maintain the di)gnit)y of lawy-ers and prevent several courts from finding excuses to pur-po-s-el-y make difficulties for la"wyer"s, the Supreme Law p>romulg>a>te>d t^he "Rules on Security C}he}c}k}s by Judicial Policemen o~f t@he People ’ s Courts" i!n 2'01'4, estab^li^shing the principles tha-t lawyers do no<t n)e)ed to conduct personal security chec~k i;n cour*t.
Since t)he issuance o:f the Ru;le, l:aw:yer:s hav]e s)et examples, and ther`e have been few incidents endangering the court security h+ap+pe+ned d#ue to the o]m]issions of security checks.
In such a v^ery rare case happened i|n Q/uanzhou, as long as we communicate i]n a spi-r-i-t of mut>ual resp>ect an{d understanding, misunderstanding i"s no~t difficult to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization i)n t-he la$wye$r profession, the Lawyers Association bea-rs the d[ual mission o(f disciplining against l@aw and safeguard the legitimate right|s.
In the pa|st, in>di>vid>ual Law^yers Association organizations have been blamed for their emp'hasis on disciplinary action an/d thei<r l%o%s%s of safeguard.
The decision of the Quanzh,o,u Lawyers Association is worthy of pra:ise b)ot)h in terms o+f proc|ess and res^ults, a\nd i!t sets an example for m%o%re lawyers association to p?erform the/ir duties correctly.
Which tax b^ene^fits will affect our m^one^y ba/g f\ro\m October 1?
Xinhua N-ew-s Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (reported b=y Sa=ng Tong)--T/he New Individual In(com(e Tax L(a(w will be impl[e[me[n[ted f-r-om January 1, 2)019 . I<n order to hav.e the broad masses o;f t>he people enjoy the benefits of tax reduction as soon as p%os%sib%le, the t-a-x will firstly be dedu.cted from taxpay:e:r:s' actual job s"al"ar"i"es base<d o{n th-e mi%nimum threshold of 5000 yuan per month from October 1, 2019, a!nd t|he n,e,w tax r)a)te schedule will b[e applied.
Wi/th t)h)e imp}lemen}tat}io}n of new policy, which b_e_nefits w|i|ll really affect t_he people's money bag?
The first be!nef!it: the income ta<x wil@l be re>du>c>e>d significantly in the job s#ala#ries.
T+h+e tax"p"ay"e"r receiving th.e job salaries after October 1 can ha)ve th&e basic deduction o}f fees deducted base"d on t~h~e thr/e/shold of 500{0 yuan pe&r month, and the new tax rate schedule will be applied . M>o>st of the taxp+aye+rs will enjoy d#i#ffe#rent l`evels of ta;x reduction, especially the lower a!n!d midd+l+e-+inco+me people, who will s*ee mor,e significant tax reduction.
According t:o th<e tax reduction fact shee-t o}f diffe{rent inc^om^e groups, for t]h]e pe|o|p|le whose monthly inco;m;e will be 8.0.00 yuan, 10(000 yuan, 2%000%0 yu#an, a`nd 5000$0 yuan aft^er deducting the "three insurances and one fund", t<h<e taxable am?oun?t?s after t+he ta"x refor'm will be 90 yu/an, 290 yuan, 15=9=0 yuan, and 9090 yuan r%esp%e%c%ti%vely . Compared with the monthly threshold of 3500 yuan, t:h:e corr}esp}on}ding t/ax reduction ratio i~s 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.@0%, 18.8% respectively.
It is worth not/ing t]hat due to holidays, the new basic deduction of fees and tax r"ate schedule can be applied t<o the salaries that should be pai"d b{y the units i_n Oct`obe`r but h~av~e b]ee]n pa&id a|t the end of Septembe]r according t_o la*ws.
For this purpose, the withholding cl|ient sof$t$wa$re, which i`s unif>orm>l>y promoted and used by t|h|e ta#x department, has provided the c(o(rresp(o(n(ding tax calculation fu]nct]i]on, but the corresponding t*ax sti_ll needs to be declared a?n?d pa~id d%uring the statutory declaration per,i,od.
The second benef=it: t-h-e gaps between grades of l)ow t]a]x r|ates wi?l?l be obviously widened.
In addition t'o raising the t|hre|sh|ol|d, th(e n`e`w t=ax rate s?c?hedul?e will be applied from October 1.
Thi.s time, seven grades o%f tax rates of j)o)b sal[a[ri[es are the sa`me as be`fore w\it\hou\t any changes, but the gaps between grade%s o<f tax r.ates a-re obviously changed . The gaps between t?h?r?e?e g/r/ades of low t\a\x rates in 3%, 10% and 2*0% are obviously wide.ned, the g;ap of the grade o/f ta(x ra@te i:n 25% is slightly narrowed, bu&t the gaps between three grades of h~i~gh tax rates i(n 3!0%, 35% and 45% a)re t.he sam'e a$s before.
It is wor\t\h n`o`ting that the tax law has also adjus~ted t$he grades o%f tax rates fo-r inco}m}e f'rom production an*d business operation, and the lower li{mit of the high`est grade of tax rate i@n 35% ha"s been increased from 0.1 million yu*an t|o 0.5 million yuan.
Thi(s means that the individual businesses and personal excl[u[s[ive i]n]vestment enterprises will bene#fit from this t!ax re~fo~rm.
"From the p'erspective of measurement a}nd calculation o+f personal t.a.x reduction for Shanghai taxpayers in the earlier stage, the broad masses of ta`xpay`ers w!ill fu?lly ex_p_erience th]e ben+efi+ts of th`e personal income tax reform, especially the lower and mi\d\d\l\e-in\c\ome people, w.h.o will s-ee m*o*re significant ta<x reduction. "
La~n Min, the head of P`ers`on`a`l Income Tax Division o/f Shangha+i T-a-x B:ur:eau of the State Administration o]f Taxation, said.
The third benefit: th.e tax service w?ill become m@ore c#onv#en#ient a>nd optimized.
Sh(a(n(gha(i tax depar.tm.e.nts have carried out a series o*f comprehensive activiti[e[s o+f tax propaganda since the announcement of the n`e`w personal in.come t?ax law.
O*n t'he one hand, t{he{y provided the policy guidance on `!` o,n,e,-,t,o,-on,e & point-to-point" for t?he important tax sources an$d important en{te{rpr{i{s{e{s.
P/udo/ng New A"r"ea T^ax Bureau ha*s visi~ted Apple Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Alipay (China) Network Tech+nol+ogy Co., Ltd+., Red Star Macalline Gr.ou.p C{orporati{o{n Ltd. a{nd ot|her large enterpris@es succ:e:s:s:ivel:y . These en^terp^r^ise^s h|a|ve a lar#g#e number of employees and a large amount of wo~rks in withholding and remitting tax, so the tax department actively pr'ov'ide'd c:oac:hin:g and answered questions; X[uh[u[i District Tax Bureau has v.isi.ted some la\rg\e l?ab?o?r s*ervi*c*e ent$er$p$ri$s$es, i&nclud&ing CI+I+C Financial Consulti^n^g L/t/d. and CIIC Shanghai Economic and Technical Cooperation Ltd.. wi+thin t!h!e district . It c;oll;ec;ted their c?o?n?cerne?d problems, responded to their appeals, an{d resolved their difficulties in a t'i'mely way.
On th"e other hand, they i[m[p[le[me[nt[ed the `;` comprehensive, mu(l(tidi(mensi(ona(l and st~ereos~cop~ic" tax policy promotion fo<r the citiz-e-n taxpayers.
They used Shanhai Tax offici=al w/ebsit/e, WeChat official acco<unt, Mic{roB{log and other resources t$o po/st the hot to/pi/cs and ensured that the po%l%icy anno+un+ceme+nts were in place.
At th:e sa'me time, Shanghai T?ax WeChat official account ha/s p`ut the 12$3$66 Int"ellige"nt Consulting Platform since September 28 . It would car>ry out the "targeted '>' integrated intel?l?igent services of personal income tax reform via the `?` Human+Intelligence ']' t\ax s}er}vice consultation.

The Yangcheng Lak$e hairy c[rab is also k&n&own as the `_` go*ld*en c@law cr'ab". Because t<he crab b[od[y is not mudd|y, it is commonly known as the clear water hairy cr!ab .

T^h^e United Stat{e{s, Canada and Mexico have c!onclu!ded a tr]i]la]t]e]ra]l trade agreement, and i;t will b<ring new o'ppo'rt'uni't'ie's to 500 m{il{l{ion people.
According to foreign me.d.ia reports, the joi.nt statement by t{he Minister o)f Foreign Affairs of Canada Freelan%d and t,h,e Uni$ted Sta^tes Trade Representative Lighthizer, which w?as published on th=e Canadian gov;e;rn;ment website, indicated t]hat the U/ni/t/ed States, Canada and Mexico ha\d reached a trilateral trade a~gree~me~nt, which was c-a-l-led `[` USMCA" (Th|e Un)ite)d St&ates-M&ex&ico-Canada Agreement).
The CT*V Ne,ws Channel i?n Canada previously quoted t%h%e message from t@he Uni\t\ed S}t}ates senior source saying that Canada a^nd the U"nit"e"d States had settled d,if,fe,re,nce,s a,nd concluded an agreemen-t on the North American F!ree Trade Agreement (NAFTA).

I*t is reported tha|t t^he existing Nort=h American Free Trad+e Agreement w+a+s signed by the United States, Mexico and Ca{nda in 19=94.
After taking offi`c`e as president, Trump a&nn&ounced that h&e pl*anne*d to reconsider t<h<i<s agreement and si%g%n a n!e!w agreement.
T>h>e t{hree c-ountries have started the negotiation progress o{f it since 2017.
Th&e resu\lt of the Elec{t{ion o_f Okinawa Gov:ernor, w?hich was con*duct*ed ahead of sch-ed-ule because the form`er governor O'naga Ta\k\esh\i had died of i!ll!nes!s, was announced on October 1 local time . De}nn}y Tamaki, who opposed the plan of relocat-in-g the US military base i/n Japan, was e]lecte]d suc(cessf(ully.
This election was voted on September 30 . Th?e f!in!al result showed that Tamak^i had 3966!32 votes, whic,h was th/e m}ost votes made in th^e history of the Ele)c)tion of Okinawa Governor . He had over 80000 more vo.tes tha@n h%is major opp#o#n#ent Atsus$hi S+a+kim+a.
A t|otal of 4 candi#d#ate#s participated in t"h"i"s election, and the voting rate w)as 63.24%, which w?as 0}.}89% lower than that o\f the Electi?o?n o?f Okin=awa Governor i_n 2014.
Tamaki told the med~i~a on Oc+tob+er 1 th<at the result of electi}on showed that the Okinawa p.eople didn't want t(o waste the former governor Onaga Ta?keshi '{s efforts during his lifetime, a\nd h)e w?ou?l?d carry out Takeshi ']s behests to make c>o>nt>in>ued effor/ts in opposing th_e plan of relocating t&he US military base an-d th#e c[l[osur[e of t`h`e Futenma base to the Japanese government and t{he American governmen't.
Th|e Futenma base is located in G}i}now}an i=n Okinawa Prefecture, and it has be"en criticized all th&e time . The J(apan(ese gove;rn;ment an_d the American government h_a_v_e agreed to relocate it t#o Henoko in N}a}go, but the O~kinaw~a people strongly oppose this a'ct'i'on an|d hope to mo{ve the base completely o>u>t o+f Okinawa.
For the re:l:o:c:ation plan strongly opposed b&y Okina#w#a people and th+e request to cancel th\e p+er+mit f|or land reclamation along the coas#t of Henoko, Tamak_i said that he did n'#t stand o"n t]he opposite and divisive ground against the central government at the be^gi^nning . He hoped that both s=id=es could fully exchange vie/ws, s[how the i&n&te&ntion to solve t#he pr]obl]ems thr[ough negotiation.
Japanese President Sh>inzo Ab<e also tol:d t.he media in the m:orning of October 1 that he would seriously ac/cep/t this result and mak?e efforts to revitalize Okina^wa a}n}d red~uc~e the burden on the b*ase.
Yoshihide Suga, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Jap+a+n, said in th#e pres}s conference on October 1 t)ha)t the go]v]ernm]e]nt '.s policy of reloca]ting th;e U.S base as soon a-s possible had not been cha+ng+e+d a't all.
An,d h|e also e$x$pr$e$sse$d h(is intention to talk with Tamaki.
Tamaki will officially take u+p his d&ut&ie&s as the gove\rnor o+f Okinawa.
Since th!e mid[-[20[0[0[s, wit'h Chin^a ’ s increasing n<eeds for oilseeds, Pa:u:l Thomas, a fa_r_me_r in N\o\r\th Dakota, has gr~ow~n more and more soybeans i,n his field.
This tra/ns/it/ion reaches th(e peak this ye@a@r . H"e has gr'own 1,6>0>0 acres of soybeans i~n t_he 5,000-acre land, reaching an unprecedented scale
Howeve^r, i/n 2019, T?homas and m:any f*a*rmers like him plan to switch prod.uc.tio.n to t+h+e staple crops in the f;orme;r U.S. ag}ricul}t}u}ral region, suc@h as corn and wheat.
The area o!f soybeans g`ro`wn by American f(a(r(mers exceeds tha\t of corn this year, which is for t`h`e f[i[rst time i&n 3.5 years.
T,h,e reason wh$y th,e farmers plan to switch production to other crops is that America*n fa\r\m\e\rs f.ace difficulties in selling soybeans in t-he context of th}e trade war l\aun\che\d by Preside(nt Trump again/st China.
China usu;ally purchases a/r/ound 60% of soybeans exported from Am:eri:ca, bu-t b'e'caus'e o_f t"he trade war, the purchases of American soybeans a\re near+ly z\ero i}n recent months, leading t)o a 10-year low in soybean prices.
Thomas plans t-o grow mor@e wheats ne'xt year an-d hopes to earn more by r~educi~n~g depende|n|c|e o!n cr;op;s that rely on Chinese demands.
Th`o`m`as said that t+he soybean price "brin`gs u~s a heavy blow '%'.
He sa(i(d that the spot pric_e of soybe)a)ns near h"is f$ar$m wa&s $7.10 per bushel without Chinese demands, wh[ile t%he price needed for co`ver`ing cost)s was $8.50.
The area of soybeans grown by American farmers h-its a hi!g!h r/e/c/ord and the harv<es<t i%s expected to hi$t a high reco{rd.
At such a vul{nerable time, th]ey a^r^e hit by the t!ra!de w$ar.
As Trump im~p~o~se~d tariffs on t/he goo"d"s i,mp,or,ted from C>h>ina, Chi:na imposes tariffs on the soyb`ea`ns imported from America in July.
Th!e U"nite"d States Department of Agriculture will release the first estim<ated rep=ort of cul@tivated a`rea next year, which i's expecte)d to include consideration of tari@ff effects.
This estimate i_s e-xpected to confirm the expectations o&f non-governmental or*ga*ni*z*a*t*i*ons that the cultivated a$rea of soyb~eans will be re}duced.
According to a repo>rt s#een b(y Reu]te]rs, o'n O*ctober 1-9, I;n;forma Economics predicted that t:he cultiva_t_e_d ar+e+a of corns would increase by 4% to 92.7 millio'n acres (37.5 million hectares) and t)he cultivated area of so[y[beans would decrease b=y 7% to 83 m}illi}on acres in 2019.

Xinhua Int.ernation.al Commentary: D=efe=nd Multilateralism, China F)ull)y Honor Its C;ommi;tme;nt;s.
U_nder the circumstan"ce of unilateralism adverse current surg{ing, in/te/rn/ati/onal rules and m)ult)ilateral order h~a~ve been impacted.
To some extent, t"he confrontation b^etw^een unilateralism and mu+l+t+ila+teral+is+m has entered int`o a critic|al perio:d.
As a r)es)ponsib)le gre]at power, China h&a&s taken the id[e[a of following t@he general tendency a_n_d corresponding with m&ajo&r principles and the ac*ti*on with s!olid and power to maintain multilateralism w|ith the internati&on&al communi!ty and promote multilateralism going ahead contin.uo.u.sl.y.
Facing the ne.w s*i*tu*ati*o*ns and new c:h:al:l:enges, China h^as issued a loud voice o>n the devel&op&m&ent direction and p'ath of multilateralism.
A's W%ang Y:i, State Councilor and Foreign Minister, s`t`a`ted at the General D.ebat.e of the 7/3rd Session o}f th@e U%N General Assembly that multilateralism i,n the n]ew era should p|ursue the goal of win-win c+oo+pera+tion, act upon r"u"l"es and order, uphold fairness and justice, a]n]d act to deliv_er real resul!t!s.
At the same time, C\hina calls for t,he establishment of a g-loba-l develop&ment cooperation of making the Un!it!ed Nations as t*h*e co%re, North-South cooperation as the main cha\nnel and South-South cooperati#on a's t(h(e comple\me\nt, a;nd calls o_n all parties t\o work together t{o b?u?i?l?d a community with shared future for mankind.
C,hi,n,a ’ s thou;ght and voice reflect th-e mains`tr`e`am o}f the international community.
As the President o[f the 73]r]d Uni"ted Nations General Ass)embl)y Espinosa said, u!nd!er the c+urr+ent situa%tio%n, "the United Nations needs to develop and expand multilateralism an,d mai'nt'a'in a ru?l?es-b?ased international system m'or'e than e=ver".
La!garde, President of International Monetary Fund, sa;id th~at t_h_e international community should c{on{t{i{nue to firmly uphol`d the multilateral trading syst]e]m, adh{er{e to int>ernation>al trade rules, a%nd resolve differences thro:u:gh consultation.
In recent years, as the changes o~f globa$l economy and political power balance, some n[e[w[ly[-[deve[lopi[n[g markets a`n`d developing countries h-a-ve eme_rg_e_d i'n groups, playing a greater role in the major in^t^er^nationa^l multilateral mechanisms, an\d providing n:ew development i-mp-e-tus for th&e mul<tila<te<ralism t)ha)t h&as suffered from the head=wi=nds.
Thinking in this dimensi.on, building a b]ig family b^u^t not making u&p small circles, adhering to discussion and collaboration b!u!t n(ot winner-take-all and other the multilateralism ideas advocated b>y China fo=ll=ow the trend o=f th?e t{imes, the;y are the inevitable c_h_o_ices t<o c"op"e with global challenges and solve world problems, representing the common pu@r@s@uit o}f the majo,rity countries around t@he wor~l~d.
Advan?ced idea wi)th m)ore solid action.
C+h+ina ’ s "O+ne Belt One Road" ha@s become t]he largest international cooper,ation pl@a@t@for@m.
`@` One Belt One Road", A)sian Infrastructure In>vest>ment Bank, `?` 16(+1 Cooperation ';' a-n-d ot(h(er inte`r`nat`io`nal and regional cooperation init%iat%ive%s launched b[y China promote international cooperation, improve e-x-istin-g international syst!e!ms and order, and bring innovation vitality to multilateral coo@pe@rati@o@n and make contribution t'o the development of t*h*e international order in a more j{ust an#d rational d'ir'ect'i'on.
As the defender of the i{n{t{ernatio{nal ord?er and th>e practitioner o_f multilate.r.ali.sm, China ’ s actions are b=ec=om=ing more and more powerful i)n the mu?l?ti?lateral stage of th]e United Nati^ons.
Mediate heate%d-%disc%u%ssi%on international points, add_r_e_s_s cli#ma#te chan>ges, participate in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reduce poverty a(n(d help the poor, and help other countries impleme^nt t)he 203,0 Agen>da for S$ust$aina$bl$e De!v!elopment.
A)s United Na>ti>ons Se;c;retar;y-G;enera;l, G~ut~e~rres said, China has become an i?mpo?rtant pillar of mult<ila<teralism.
When the "trust defi)c)it" fa~ced by the world intensifies, when Populism an*d polarization t<rend<s a(re on the rise, i=t is the mos>t urgent moment tha?t the worl{d needs multi"late"ral coop.era.tio.n.
At such a h|is|to|rical juncture, the in*te*r*na*t*i*o*nal community needs t)o join han_d_s t"o turn consensus into actions, resolutely defend mult|i|la|t|eral|i|s|m, an]d jointly promote th+e building of community with s~har~ed futur-e for m%an%ki%n%d.

At 10 a&m o:n the same da]y, Xi Ji)npi)ng and other Party and state lea|de|rs, t+o+g+ether wit)h representatives from a[ll s'e'ctors of t&h&e capital, attended the ceremony for presenting flower baskets t@o the people's h*eroes t"o remember t^h^e heroes and martyrs.
F_or this, CC&TV is]su]ed a quick comment: this was th:e first Memorial D=ay after t#he implementation of the law for t,he prote%ction of h?eroes a$n$d martyrs in China.
Five years ag`o, the Memorial Day was s@e@t u:p on the eve o{f the National Day, ma@r@k@i@ng th#e great course of the Chinese natio%n from suffering to glory . We mu~st always b~e v:ig:ilant tha[t "where we c{ome fro@m and where t#o g%o".
Gen,e,r,a,l Secretary Xi Ji)nping profoundly pointed out tha;t "abandoning tr(ad(ition and discarding th-e root i`s equivalent to cutting o%ff one's own spiritua+l lifeline '<'.
"Only by remembering history can we op,e,n u_p t^he f}uture. "
We advocate heroes and c\omme\mo\r\ate martyrs, whi+ch means w_e must always reme@mb@er hist&o&ry, persist hero{ic spirit, and condense th/e strong positive en(er(gy for national rej%uv%ena%ti%on.
The quick comment has poi|nte|d ou@t that heroes are t"h"e backbone o{f the na,t,ion.
To honor a*n*d pay homa_ge t.o t}he martyrs is to let the her)oes a.nd m}art}y}rs become our noble, holy, and powerful eternal memory i[n the he(art.
According to the inco=m=plete statistics, around 20 mill|ion martyrs died heroically fo\r national independence, liberation o@f the people, p#r#os#perit#y o$f th~e country and th)e well-being of th;e pe/ople.
Every martyr who died f_or the cou@nt@r@y will be re`mem`bered, and ev:e:ry spirit of loy!al!t!y to th%e country will be res-p-ec-te-d.
T~o set up the national Memorial Day fo"r t`he`m and organize various forms of commemorative activities i&s to p"ay homage t#o them i:n the name of the country, deeply remem'ber their gr{e{at a)chievements an.d lea<r<n to pas{s on their p{recio{us s`pi`rit of loving t%h%e motherland, being l~oyal to the people, selfless dedication and daring t:o sacrifice.
Party committ_ees a>nd g/o/ve/rnme/n/t/s at all levels have i+mproved the pens?ion preferential t;reatmen;t system and constantly raised t&he level of pension treatment . The Party and t^he state hav\e h\o\n\ored h(eroes with concrete actions.
Every ye{ar, c<ou<n<t<less people p*a*y tribute to t{h{e martyrs cemetery, which let us fee`l th/e deep pe>o>p>le's feeling of the memory, and feel t^he power o,f revival ri<sen from t%he national blo<o<d.
Advocating, defending, learning from and caring for heroe`s ha<s beco.me a co/m/m/o/n practice in the who}le soci@ety.
The quick comment finally pointed out that in the n}ew era of s#oc#i#ali#sm w,ith Chin+ese c{harac{teri{st{ics tod<ay, w\e can comfort th[e dea[d and buried he^roes and mar<tyrs that a strong China has been rising from the east, and the Chinese dre=am of the gr]eat rej@u@v@e@nation of th&e C*hi*nese nation has b;een becoming a reality in ou!r hands.
L|e|t's forge a\hea\d with the s=pi=r=i=t of heroe%s and martyrs, a}n}d move f&orward to the great goal!

The fifth `{` Month of voca~l~iza~ti~on f&or the disabled '-' comes; focus on the issue of sex education f"o"r disabled teenage>rs - C[hin[a Ne%w%s
In recent years, the topic of se)x education for Ch@inese teenagers ha%s been widely d>i>sc>ussed, but t<h<e challe)nge for s)ex education for d"is"a"bled teenagers is st[ill arduous.
R*ecent*l*y, the se+mina+r on challe;n;ge;s and p=ract=i=cal strategies of comprehensive sex educa~ti~o~n f@or the disabled was held in Bei'j'in'g.
It i[s an major issue about how t^o c$ar$ry out s?ex education fo~r disabled children and y{o{ung people in this se-minar.
`!` The rep/o/r/t of sexual knowledge, att}itud}es an#d behaviors of Chinese disable'd children and y&oun&g people" released a;t th>e mee}ting reveals that the proport=ion of disabled c*h*ild*ren subjected t~o sexual harassment and abuse is higher than that of h;e;alth;y children.
For disabled children and teenagers, what the so"ciety focus!es o*n is the at~t~enti~on of `@` se#x#ual protection".
Th|is seminar aims at promoting th)e compr&ehe&nsiv&e sex education for di]sabl]ed chi]ldren an_d teenagers in C)h)ina fro?m three as]pec]ts of family support, school education and i~ns~tit~uti~on services, providing s#u#pport to the disabled children an-d teenagers from the s*ource, thus letting t$hem enjoy the right of love as o}thers d#o.
Experts believe th?at th`e Chinese public u{n{der{st{and{i{ng of d!isable!d groups has remained at a level th@at is n&ot de@ep enough for a l'ong time.
Being influenced by the traditional concept a,nd other f}actors, the comprehensive sex e#ducat#i#on for the disabled, especially for th-e di,sa,bl,ed ch*il*dren an`d t?e?enage?rs in China, i%s not d!ee!p enough.
Ho+we+ve+r, in r|ec|ent y?ear?s, with t>he support o^f the U'NES'CO an!d p(u(blic(-sp(irite(d people, the pr$actice a(nd implementation path of full-cycle compre;h;ensiv;e sexual and reproductive health education for the disabled i:n China have made gratifying progress.
"T-he report '.' s,how,s that the children and young people with v]i]su]al imp-a-i-rmen-t, hearing impairment, intellectual impairment and p]hysical impairment hav.e more difficulties in ac_q_uiri_n_g sexual knowledge a#nd und'erst'a'ndi'ng intimate relationship th_an the ordinary p#eo#ple, but they have generally developed towar|ds convenience a{nd enrichm(ent.
"T;he seminar on challenges a)nd practical strategies o~f comprehensive se,x education for the disabled" i%s hel)d b]y the Shanghai Youren P_u_b_l_ic Wel%fare Foundation and supported by the UNESCO R-epr-e-s-ent-ativ-e O_f_f_ice in C'h'ina, t:h:e Beijing Representative Office of the International League for Dis#a#bled Pe%rsons (France) and the UNFPA Representative Office in China . It@s purpose is t`o explore the practice a!nd implementation path o,f full-cycle comprehen.si.v.e sexual a[nd reproductive health education f>o>r the disabled i|n t{he context of grand strategy o]f healt}hy C^h^i^na, and promote the interested parties of po#li#cy makers, ed]u]c]a]to]rs, res#earc#hers, social service organizations and parents ’ representatives in the field o>f spec}ial education and integrat"ed education to understand th,e int(e(rnational policy on comprehensive sexual education and the ri;ght t]o health of disabled c'hildren and young peo;pl;e; t!h!e practice>s, strategies, cha=llenges and resources o(f sex education for disab-l-ed child&re&n a@nd young peopl-e i>n C_hi_na are widely exc'hange'd, and t,he w%a%y o|f comprehensive sex education fo!r disabled children a_nd young people i[n t*he future is discussed and a blueprint is se*t up to form a support network.
Repo"r"t of t{he R/e/ute/rs o?n September 30 in Beijing - People's Bank Of C=h=ina rele"ased its pred{etermine{d sho-r-t-term n=et outflow of foreign c"ur"renc"y assets on Sunday and showed a>s o!f the end of Augus+t this year, its s%ho%r%t positions in forward an"d f$utures contracts fo=r foreign currencies vs local currencies rem:ained zero for 12 consecutive months, a=nd t\h\e\re were st+ill no long position in that month.
Previous data from the Pe$ople '+s Bank O]f China showed t=h=at as of the end of August last yea=r, the i/t h,ad a total short p"o"sitio"n of $6_._04_4 b%il%li%on i.n forward and fu?tu?re?s contracts for foreign currencies vs lo[cal currencies, un$ch$anged for the f`o`urth consecutive month; t~he short p`os`ition in SD@R (Special Draw!ing Rights) wa^s 4.276 billion SDR.
Since t!he!n, the foreign exchange forwards short position of th"e P%e%o%ple's Bank O{f Ch>ina rem=ai=n=ed zero.
People '[s Bank Of China released the d'a'ta fo@r the fir@s@t time at the e`n`d o#f M-a-rch 2016; the dat;a showed that a}t the end of February 2'0'16, i~ts lo`ng po.s.itions in forward and futures contracts fo[r foreign currencies v^s local currencies was US $2.438 billion and short p|os|it|ions was U:S $28.9 bi!llio!n.

People's Bank Of China has previo(usly said that the forward and futures s.hor.t positions of foreign cu@rre@n@cies vs local currencies mainly reflec#ted the fo/rw/ard opera`tio`ns of foreign exchange carried ou*t by the P,eople '!s B^a^nk Of China wit#h co&mme&r&cial banks w>it>h t]he pu#rpose of meeting the hedging ne?e?ds of enterprises' foreign cur[rency liabilities .

From the public op)in)ion, al=th=ough the f_in_a_l result i*s mostly that the persons w@ho fo?rci?b?ly occupy seats are condemned by th(e p<ubli<c, ad:mini:s:trative:ly pun?ished by t&he public security department, a$nd even included in the bla@c@klist of integrity, the pu-blic still feels tha[t i/t does no}t "v^ent the[ir hates": W^hy can ’ t the p"ers"ons who forcibly occupy s@eats be punished on the spot?
Wh.y can ’ t stop i_m_mor_al or even illega&l behav`ior on the spo$t, but can only puni{s{h i"t afterwards?
And for the unreasonable behavior o$f `|` the elder u=nc=le who forcibly o+ccupy se+ats '[', w:hy only a mal=e passenger pull him up because of "Road se[e in<justice"?
The main re)as)on is t;hat only long-distance trains are equipped with rail.way policemen, and ther%e is generally n\o rai<lw<ay p_o_liceme_n for short-distance trains; even if th`ere i^s ra+i+lw+ay police"m"e"n, the p;a;ss;e;ngers are more concerned abo(u(t the possible rogue re~a~ctions of the pe!r!s!o!ns who forcibly occupy sea-ts a{n{d do n?ot take compulsory taking away measures.
Repeated seat^s forcibly occupied e<vent<s have made people realize that i|t i#s necessary to le?t th)e persons who forcibly o@ccupy s*e*ats b[e for^ce^d to take away o~r even be punished on the spot.
Thi:s requi`res that our railway policemen should dare t]o take powe*rf*ul measures i#n a t~im~ely manner . Tra@ins t`ha`t do n/ot h:av:e policemen should make deployment a.s soon as possible to preserve and prev)ent illegal activities i;n a timely manner.
It i\s th>e f*i*rst d'a'y o?f the National Day holiday in October 1 . There is a surge in th!e ve?hic?le?s heading f#or Mao County and Songpa_n County vi+a Beichuan Qia#ng Minority Autonomous County i*n Sichuan.
Beichuan Traffic Police receiv~ed a call for help at a,bout 13:00 say*ing that a fam$i$ly member had a traffic accident i&n Songp|a|n a[n[d was b+adly in need of being s+ent to Mianyang for treatment due t[o th$e l<imited local medical c^ond^it^ions.
However, the H:u:a:n:hu R}o}ad o~f Tangjiashan q\uake lake in Beichuan was unde?r one-way t<r<affic control, so the call,er hoped the traffic police wo.u.ld p'ermit the 120 emerge=ncy ambulance to pass though th.e road.
After getting the call fo*r help, th-e p%oli%cema%n o&n du$ty quickly reported this to the t'ra'f'fi'c po#l#i#ce group . A}fter under>stan>ding the general si]t]u]ation, t,he group leader Huang Xu`e`min im<media<te<ly arranged th-e pol<ic<e<m<e<n on duty at the controlled site t'o co,n,ta,ct with the help seeker and asked them to do the escort job w!ell.
`]` There were more than 1000 ve(h(i(cl(es ha`v`i`ng entered the c(on(t(rolled r$o$ad seg'ment at that time . A}f}t}e}r contacting with the 120 emergency ambulance, we esti$m$ated that it would arr"iv"e a%t Beichuan at about 15:00, s-o we i)m)plemented the arrangement a?n?d deployment immediately. `+`
The leader of Yuli Squadron of Beichuan Traffic Pol>ice Da W$e$i introduced that the emergency ambu+lance needed to bypass t+he Huanhu R<oad of Tangj;i;a;s;han quake l}ake, and the road w.as steep and n|arrow . In order to p[reve[nt the vehicles in the road segment f@rom runnin_g side b#y sid@e, t*he tr%a%ffic polic"e implemented t?he subsection control of veh'i'c'les in t-he beg|i|nning, t~he middle a:n:d the end of the road an ho^ur i*n a/d/van/ce and r"e"min"ded all drivers passing through it to make a way for the emergency a"m"bulance.
Later, t,he p}ol}icemen o"f Leigu Squadron also stopped the v~ehic~les ente[ri[n[g the controll!ed road segment temporarily, and as~ked the vehicles to for=m a line to mak>e a way for th=e in]comi]ng 120 emergency ambula^nce.
An emergency ambulance with a `^` Chuan U" license plate was driving into Beichuan a)t about 15:0<0, an^d Beichuan Traffic Pol;ice s|en|t a police car to c{l{e{ar t=he wa{y and escor`t the emergency a%mbulan%ce into t=h=e controlled r[o[ad seg+ment by drivi~ng against the traffic.
It w"as learned that so#m#e places on Huanhu Road onl>y permitted one ve~hicle pa&ss&ing th&ro&ugh, and t}he polic]e implemented the temporary control a?t these places so that th[e 120 emerg:en:cy ambula"nce could successfully pass through.
It was impossible t[o give way in a road segment in S[hilib[e[i Village i{n Daxuanping Town, so the t,ra,ff,ic police got i@n t;ouc;h with the v+illage party branch an)d village committee in advance t?o u@se the village road for bypassing an[d s~top th$e social vehicles fro@m ente$r$i$ng.
"It only took 4~0 minutes from Bei'chua'n Traffic Police met t/he 1|2|0 emergency ambulance to drive into th~e norm!al road o;f the 3/02 p~r~ovin~cia~l highway. "
D:a W>ei explained that the overall passing ti_me nee%ded t]o b(e 4 hours under normal circumstances.
"This arrangement has suc>cessful>ly saved precious t=re=at=me=nt t|ime for the patient. `^`
It was learned t;hat the critically ill patient was timely s=ent t*o Mi{anya{ng for treatmen.t a>t 17:20.

Two s*u*spe*c*te*d pick}pocket}s w{e{re c`aught w]hen they were pi(ckin(g pockets on N*o . 2)0 bus from Yongding Gate Station t~o Zhushikou Station at 8:05 yesterday morning.
These t$w$o male pickpockets cut the passe{nger '?s coat p_oc_ket, and stole 800 yuan c!ash from it . How"ever, they w=ere caught re(d-hand(ed by t=h=e policemen, who h(a(d already waited nea.rb.y.
Thi#s is the fi;r;st pickpocket case cracked by Bei]j]ing police during the Na.tion.a.l D{a{y holiday.
The anti-pickpocket invest|igat|ors of Beijing Police M.obile Investigation Co=rp=s arrived at t&he designated position at about 5_:00 y*ester*day morning.
According t|o the previous experience, t"he pla?ces with massive human traffic, in`clu`di`ng the public transit hubs, bus and s@ubway lin{es, a^nd even the crowd watching t%he f@l@a@g-@raisi@n@g ceremony in Tia;n;a;nm;e;n Sq$ua$r$e, a!r!e the key are=as i%n their work.
In th{e crowd, t`he plai)ncl)othes policemen were calmly observing th(e people passing b>y.
The investi*ga*t*or*s, w@ho were waiting a.t the bus station, found t>w>o suspicio\u\s m?a?n following a man to get o)n N.o . 2!0 bus from Yongding Gate Station at a.bout 7:00.
O?n th?e bus, the two m)en standi|ng on the left and ri<ght of the male p(assen(ger, an;d one of them tried t{o provide cover f=or the other.
But th}e}y did n/'t know th,at the plainclothes po{lice{m{e{n s;tan;d;in;g by were paying close attention to the]ir every movement.
`}` Catch the th+i+ef with the stolen goods ',' . It was ver{y critical for the plainclothes policemen to choose th?e timi-ng of catching t|h|e thief . W<h<ile waiting f=or the men t@o steal, the policemen had to keep t&h&ei&r eyes on th'em, who w,ere prep!ar!ing f|or t.he pickpo$cket . As soon a;s they s_ucceede_d in pickpocket, the investigators c`augh`t t;h;em at one stroke.
The re@p@orter o!f Beijing Morning Post lear:n:ed that t/he policemen ferreted ou-t 800 yuan cash f|r|o|m the suspected pickpockets.
"T=hey took t}he money from the p$assen$ge$r's c@oa@t pocket. "
The policeman point&ed t'o a bro:k:en c>oat pocket a~n~d s|aid: "They cut it here, and stole 80)0 yuan c}as}h from a Beijing tou>ri>st . Wh/e/n we caught th+e+m, they had j}us}t put the m}one}y into their pocket. "
The rep,orte,r learne/d t!h!at the pl^a^incloth^es policemen had followed t\he suspected pickpockets f:or an ho{ur in order to catch t<he<m . F[in[ally, they caught them at one stroke when they were commi\t\t\i\n\g a cr/im/e.
Curr%en%tly, the two criminal suspects were u*n*der th+e police's ex(aminati(o(n.
Th^e plainclothes polic]em]a]n told t_he reporter that it was easy f;o;r the po[licem[an to recognize the suspects i\n th^e crowd.
"You will find out t]h]at the thi[eves' eye]s and expressions were different f*r*om t]he o_r_dinar_y p[a[sseng[er[s' wh/en yo}u h`ave caught a number of thieves . In addition to st.ar.ing at o|t|he|r people's pock=e=ts and b+a+ckp+ac+ks, they also like t*o get into th!e cro?w?d instead of avoiding the crowd. "
T]h]e policeman a@ls@o told the reporter tha)t the suspects wer,e o:f:te:n purposeless while waiting for the b#us . They liked t`o wander at the bus station a#nd w;ould follow t|h|e tar"g"et to g=e=t on a bus.
"These are the voices of experience . If you ha;v;e worked a[s a plain>cloth>es poli_ceman fo,r a l!on!g time enough, you w;ill know i:t quite sensibly. `>`
Fu\rtherm\o\re, th(e po|l|ice|m|a|n also reminded: `-` It is the most convenient to put things in the co|at pocket, but it wil/l b.e the easiest t<o b=e stolen. `>`

During tha-t tim|e, m.ore than 100 me`et`ings o-f expert argument we*re held, and the nationwide field studies an/d s}am}p}ling inspections were implemented . C?o?un?t?les?s validation ex!pe!ri!men!ts have been collected from products of hund;re;ds of enterprises on the market.
The reporter contrasts the ol!d national standard in 2005 an^d finds t"h"at t)he new national standard has not only changed from the `/` national recommen\ded st]a]ndard" to the "national mandatory s}tand}ard ')', but also a;dded a l=ot of content, including thick{n{e{s{s requi>remen>t>s, physical p!ro!perti!es, aging r~esista~n~ce, requirements for i\no\rga\n\ic filler content, requirements for a*nti-*sl*ip colloidal part:icl:e polymer cont|en|t, limits o.f har^m^ful su;bs;t;an;ces o`f surface fin`ish`ed products, limits of harmful su;bs;tances of non-solid a?nd solid materials, e;tc.

ECNS Client, Chengdu, Sep;tember 3$0 (reported by Wang Y(u) -)- There was an "in}terna}l ba\t\tl\e within the Chinese t"able tenni`s tea'm" at the 2018 ITTF Women '-s World Cup finals in th|e afternoon on Septe?m?be?r 3_0.
Di*ng Ning, the Grand Sl<a<m winner, finally secured an impressi}ve 4-0 v*i*ctory ove(r her teammate Z#hu Yul:ing, who was the hos)t, and won the g,o,lde,n meda{l aga^in in the ITTF Women's Wo>rld Cup after four y\e\a\rs . This was also the 2<1st time fo[r the Chinese table tennis tea?m t}o win t}h}e championship i|n the ITTF W>omen's World Cup.
Ding Ni%ng a{n{d Zhu Yuling are teammates and fr,ie,nds, so they are ver_y f<amiliar with e`ac`h other's technique an#d tactics.
Regardless of pre]p]aring for th:e game or warming up before t+he game, they a,re v{e{ry closely asso]c]ia]ted with each oth<e<r.
After e+n+t+erin+g t#he f/i/nals, both of them inv+ar+iably expressed that they had fulfilled th@ei@r com}petit}i}o}n duties.
H)o)w)e)ver, th!e contest between Ding Ning a[n[d Zhu Yul]i]ng can be called as a h.ot bat+tle.
In th%e first set, due to her ri}c}h experien=ce of competition, Ding Ni}ng started in t)h)e ascendant and was 3[-0 a_h_ead . T&he&n, Zhu Yuling t;ook advantage o^f t&he mistakes made by Ding Ning a#n#d ti)e)d it at 3.
Subseque>ntly, Zhu Yuling m$a$d$e increasing mistakes i$n attack, whi?le Ding Ning seized t#his opportunity to get 3 points i<n a row w-it-h a 9-5 lead, and was the f_i_rst t|o get th;e gam[e point a)t 10-6.
Although Zhu Yuling got 3 poin&ts s|traigh|tly, Ding Ning took the opportunity of se]r]ving to w.i.n 11-,9 in th"e fir"s"t set.
In t-h-e second set, Zhu Yu^l^ing still made a l/o/t of mistakes, while Ding Nin#g made good use o\f the adv@antage of be=in=g locked in a stalem,ate and hel\d a sa*f*e lead a$t 6/-1.
D_e_s_pite be}in}g 2'-'7 behind, Zhu Yuling got 2 points straightly by c#han#ging her pa(ce, a=nd then na:rrow:ed the gap to 8-9 for a ti<me b'y takin%g advantage of attacking.
At t#his c`r`uci`al moment, D+i+ng Ning got 2 points s*tr*ai*gh*t*ly and won again i<n the second set a~t 1#1#-8.
Early i~n the thi;rd set, their scores were ra<th<er c*lose r&es&ult&in&g i~n a draw at 3-3.
The(n, Ding Ning m[ade inc?rea?sing mist@akes i]n attack and lost 3 points i^n a row . However, she got 3 points straightl`y in sharp at\ta\c\k to find a@n e)qualiz)er a:t 6-6.
Zhu Y'ul'i'ng go+t 2 points s[tr[aight[l[y t^o build her advantage again, and was t<h<e first to g}et th)e game poin/t at 10-8.
However, D$ing Ning played so hard and s{o aggressive, an{d w*o*n t#he third set at 12-10 afte[r g:e:t:t:ing 4 points i)n a row.
I(n the fourth set, Z*hu Yuling m+ad+e a g:oo:d start and was 4-;2 ahead.
However, D;in;g N`i`ng showed he.r ul<tra strong a.ttacking power soon afterward and got 4 points i!n a r*ow forcing Zhu Yuling to c&al&l a t"imeout.
After the t_i_me_o_u_t, Z&hu Yuli'ng bounc%ed back a bit an(d gradually tied th'e score at 8-8.
At this critical mo~me~n~t, Ding Ning had n\o m_ercy and go?t 2 poin'ts st*raightly to re~ach the match point.
A:s Zh|u Yuling returned t-he ball out of bounds, Ding Ning w(on 4-/0 o:v:e:r her rival to take t,h,e crown.
L>ast month, Ding Ning w\as crowned the wi&nner of the B:u:l:g:ari:a Open and ended he`r 14-month trophy drought . Al(th(oug(h she e"x"pre"ss"ed before t+h+e game that she hadn't set a/ny goals for thi+s game i}n Chengdu, she r"e"vea"l"ed a'fte'r t%he sem}i}-fina}l}s in t~h~e morning that s?h?e had fulfilled her duties.
Finally, Ding Ning defeated her tea(m(ma(te Zhu Y_u_ling to win t!he third Wor}ld Cup ch"am"p"io"n of her o;w;n . She was sa+t+isfied with her per.f.ormance: "The champion i^s very im~p~ortan~t t[o eve$ry athlete.
I haven't thought of winning t`h`e cha!m!p!i!on before th_e g+ame . I just want to try m^y b\est in each game . I'm ver+y satisfied w_ith my perfo|rm|a|nce in the fin'als'. `)`
A:s the host, Sichuan g@irl Zhu Yuling won a silver medal, failing to com>plete the goal o|f defending . When ta,lki,n,g about whether t-h-e enthusiastic home cro.wd would po!se invisible pressure on h'e'r, she said: `<` I feel that I'm doing well in deal[i[n[g with pressure in t<he wh~ol~e g}am}e . Ding N]ing is pla~y~ing very w)ell to`d`ay, but I h[aven't fou;nd my pac`e. `/`
Fo)r act[i[v[at[ing r'ur'al c|ons|u|mption, i=t is necessary t-o r~ely on the normalization m(e(chanism t(o purify the market, guide the demand for h>ealt>h>y consumption, an/d enhance the sense of g,ain in farmers ’ consumption.
According to dat:a, the consumption potentiality of rural residents has been continuously re[leased . In the f*i*r*st ha}l}f o?f thi@s y"ear, th~e r*e*tai*l sales o\f rural consumer g,oods increased by 10.5%, and the growt(h rate is 1=.=3 percentage points higher th(an that o]f towns.
During t"h"e v*i*sit to a poor village in a western cou"nty, there is only on+e convenience store in the whole village . Stepping into the store, some item_s are the brands w&e familiar with, ho?wever there ar\e lots o"f fak^e goo+d, such a%s `{` 金龙鱼 '[' i]s labeled as "金龙油 '_' and "旺仔 '[' lab,el,ed a!s `$` 旺奶".
Over t|he y)ears, similar phenomena have been fr=eque=nt=l=y expo]sed . So<me r=ura=l fake and inferior products imitate famous brands, they h|ave si<milar n)ames and packages to mix t&he false wi=t=h the ge\nu\ine, which is really ha^rd to prevent.
A co-nsumer survey r/e/p/ort released b-y a city in the we}s}t shows that r-ural shopping malls and supermarkets have a ser(iou(s pr(o(b(l(em of fa;ke products, and 66% o,f us~e~rs have bought fakes in supermarkets in villages and to.wn.s offlin`e, o}f which food accou*nts for mor_e t-h-an half.
The re\leva\nt de=p=artm=ent=s cl-a-im to rectify th=e rural markets eve_ry year, while, wh^y the phenomena o&f f"ake products still occur repeatedly?
Dif%fer%e%nt f*r*om the urb/an markets, fa=rme=rs ’ aw&ar&e&n&ess of rights protection i`s re<lat<ivel<y we*ak, an-d ma>ny v[illa[ges are in remote locations within the b*lind areas of inspec&tion force can ’ t reach, so that the fake and inferior goods ha_v_e a breeding groun/d.
One product has m;ore than one regulatory departments, some a&r&e responsible for p%ri%ce, some are fo#r p-ro-du-c-t-io-n, and o/thers a;re for markets, s[o the functions are overlapped . S|tron|g measures against fake and infe&ri&o&r products ha%ve been ta#ke#n ever,y year, however t.he central management ca\n on{l{y l^ast for a period of time . O!n o{ne hand, th:e fakes e$scape the c)ra)ck down tre^n^d a|nd slowly emerged, on t%he o~ther hand, the previous fakes just have been d^ealt and th'e new fake came out.
Som$e unscrup)ulous trade'rs have initiated th%e id!ea of "going to t~he mou\nt\ainous a"re"a"s and the countryside" and some ru%r%al areas become the "waste e@limina@ti@on markets '~', both o^f these problems a(re because o)f long-term supervision m/echa/nism, difficulties in pu\ri\fying rural markets, low illegal cost an|d higher profit.
From f[oo[d an@d clothing to well-off, th%e majority o?f fa=rme=rs are movi"ng towards development type consumption.
A few days ago, the Party Central C-om-mitt-ee and t#h#e State Council issued the `?` So"me Op\in\io\ns concerning Stimulating th@e Consumption Mechanism to Further E.n.co.urag.e the Consumption Potential o^f Residents", which propose`d t~o p`ro`mot`e the level upg-rad-in-g of t[he consumption of rural residents . The purpo}se i\s to make t:he majo)rity of farmers t}o "h@ave ability to con{sume '~', `+` h}ave willing to consume ':' and "dare to consume '(' to let the rur|al consumption really flourish.
On the on&e hand, w=e must deepen reforms, eliminate drawbacks of ma|r|k|et management policies coming from multiple departments a,n,d regu:late by mor@e than one dep@a@rtme@n@t@s . According t{o local conditions, im-prov-e t{he food safety, product quality supervision network, and cons{tan{t{l{y re-duce t\he space for r]u]ral fake produ<cts manufacturing an:d se,l,lin,g.
On the other hand, it i?s necessary t>o intensify law enforcement a[nd op_en up the s-upe-rv-i-si-on of each d|epa|r|tm|en|t, and n<ever allow t!he fake an^d inferior commodities t;o breed in the c+ou+n+trysid+e.
It i[s the protection for f|armers to severely punish t}h}e behavior of entrapping farmers . N@o matter how concealed the counterfeiters hide, i*t should not be t`he reas=on fo-r the b&reedi&ng o?f th<e f^ak^e a#n#d inferior commodities . Relevant d-epar-tm-ent-s should clarify their responsibilities, an?d the grassroo~ts supervisory p-ow-e-r-s sho%uld go down . If there i/s a problem in an!y part, it is necessary t#o investigate t"he responsibility an'd let the co+unterfe+iter+s and selling persons h=ave nowhere to hide.
Str(i(ctly control the mar{k{e{t access, implement strict qualification e(x(am(inat(ion(s fo-r p<r<od<uctio<n operators . Keep the market circulation, let t'he products hav=e clear sources and o=ut=le=t markets . Think o?f ways from the source an!d th;e roots, l~et t!he le~ga~l d:ea:le:rs operate with peace o$f mind, and let the far?mers buy w?i?t?h confidence.
Activate rural consumption, guide the de[ma[nd f-o-r h(e(al(thy c_onsu_m_pti_on.
As consumptio}n up@gradi@ng, many far|m|e|rs not o%nl%y pursue of we&ll fe+d and eat well, b!ut also go after fo?r high quality life w\ith culture and h.ealthy . Thu|s, rural m,ar,ket,s are not equa-l t)o "low quality" and "lo<w price".
This needs to pro?mote t^he extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, c_o_nnect the urban and rur[al two-way linkage s!al!e!s channels, p<ro<m<ot<e the combination of of@fline i=nd=ustr=y development platf<orm and on<line e;-co;mmer;ce trading platform, s?upp?o?rt t`h`e new fo^rms an@d new mo>d>es o%f consumption to expand into t^h^e rural marke`t; promote q}ua}lifie}d villages and t_o_wns to combine trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, an*d product processing dynamically; im-pro-ve the rural mode\rn circulation network system, opt/i/mize t!h!e in)t)e)gration of stock facilities re^sources, an/d effectively reduce rural ci]rculation costs.
C|r|e|ate a cle(a(r a}nd reassuri&ng m<a<rke<t e:n:v:iro:n:m:en:t for th%e rural areas, so that farmers can afford to buy, s:o that the rural consumption can become m,ore and mo(re prosperous a=nd t]he farmers ’ senses o:f gain a-nd happiness can be enhanced.
Our count:ry will reduce t!he MFN tariff rate f}or some g(oo(ds from November 1, and the gen&eral tariff le^vel wi]ll be r_edu_ced to 7.{5%.
According to the decision of t;h;e 26th ex:ec:utive m_eeti_ng of the Sta`te Coun[ci[l, the Tariff Commission o;f t+he S$t$a$t$e Council anno+u+nce+d on Sep<temb<er 30 that the M{F{N tarif=f rate for some goods would be reduced f'ro'm November 1, 2018.
According to th;e "Tariff Commission o,f the State Council's Announcement o-n Reducing th|e Import Tariff f-or So{me Goods", the MF,N tariff rate for some goods, inc_ludin_g the industrial goods, would be re|du|ced f?ro?m N_ove_mber 1, 2018 in o$r$der to ad)apt t>o t/he i)n)du)stri)al upgrading, redu(ce t'he enterprise costs, and satisfy people '`s d{e{mands of multilevel consumption.
Th|er|e were 15'85 taxable items in total for the tax reduction go[od[s, which acco}u}n}t}ed fo:r about 1"9% of total taxable i{tems i"n ou:r country . The aver@age t!a!x ra;te was reduced from 10*.5% to 7.8% by an average of 2?6%.
Th,is tax re/duct/ion mainly involved th`e texti_le_s; stones, ceramics, gl]as]s products; some steel an^d base metal products; electromechanical dev^ices and parts, suc\h a|s metal processing mac#hi#n#ery, tex%ti%le mac`hinery, engineering machinery, el}ectric tr`ansm`ission and transformation e$qu$ipm$ent, el[e[c[tr[i[cal appliances, inst<r<ume<nt<s and a:pp:aratu:s, e$t$c .; resource g(o(o(ds and primary processed goods, s#uch as non-metal o^re^s, inor`g`anic chemicals, wo#o#d and paper products, gemstone a@n@d jade, etc.
Meanw?hile, w"ith the reduction of general tariff le|v|e|l, especially the import tariff red(u(ction of medicine and consumer goods, the t%axable items and tax r$a$t$e for impor)t ta+x o'n imp"orted goods wou$ld b|e reduced accordingly.
In order t-o i)m)ple)me)nt the decisions and depl$o$yme$nts of th@e P)arty Central Committee and the State Council, our country h|a|d implemented the zero tariff on most imported d:rugs since Ma<y 1 thi;s year, had reduced the import tariff f?or automobiles an|d pa<rts a`n`d some c_o_ns_um_er goods since Ju&ly 1, a!n!d ha`d implemented the third st:ep of tax r@ed@uction for prod}u}c}t}s i-n t!he extended scope of Information Technology Agreement.
T$h$e r[eporter learned from t,h,e Tariff Commission of the State Council that t'he genera<l tariff level i:n our country w.a.s reduc(ed from 9%.%8% of th*e pr&evious year to 7.5%, by a"n average of 23% aft>e>r several c|on|tinuous independent adjustments.
Proper ta#rif#f re[duc[tion wo]u]ld be beneficial to accelerating the balanced development of foreign trade, pro=mo=t=i=ng the higher-level open(in(g to the outside world, overall planning a<nd u%s%i%n%g the international an'd domestic resou'rc'es, an>d boosting th!e dome~stic supply-side struc|tu|ral reform.
Th+e relevant responsible person of the Commission said that this year was t`he 40th anniversary of the reform an+d opening-up . Tak@in@g th}e initiative t~o red#uce the general tariff level was the p_r_a_ctical ac|tion of implementing t$he spi|r|it of G`ene`ra`l Secretary X_i Jinping '<s i?mportant speech a=t the Boao F\orum for Asia, and our co_un_try '+s importa)nt measure of further opening up and actively expanding imports based o@n ou]r demand for high-quality development .

North Korea an`d S#o#uth Korea signed a military agreement in September, and agreed to jointly i-ns-pect t{he entra?nce of Han R_iver and other water areas from November, i?n or`d`er to en~sure the env"iron"me"nta"l protec&tio&n, tour?is?m development a;nd other aspects in such w(a(te(r areas i}n the future.
I/n October, North Ko>rea and So.uth Korea pla%nn%ed a joint inspection o:f the w"ater are\a\s during a general-level meeting.
On November 5, t~he join)t i|nspecti|on o-f th\e water areas o*f North Korea and South Ko#re#a was officially launched.

According t-o the m)i)l)ita)ry agreement signed b"y South K_orea and North Korea i`n September, vessels of both sid*e*s only need t<o inform the oth]e]r side in advance before sailing i>n common wat]e]rs i>n the fu-t-ure.
Report o=n November 5 o"f Chi&na News: the website of the Chi(n(e(se embassy i?n M-o-n-g-olia reported on N>ovemb>er 5 that Chinese c>i>t>izens Gu<o Yuqin and M{ao Runxi~n had been missing when traveling i"n Mongolia,.
I|t was un~de~rst~ood th]at these t#wo peopl#e wer?e m[emb[e[rs of t:he Blue Sky Rescue team . On O_ctober 1>9, they contacted their relatives and friends in China and said th:e:y would immediately e\xplore the mountains near the Khovsgol Lak|e . T<he<y shared their l}ocatio}n via WeChat and then went mi(ssing . I{t was suspec;t;ed that they h/a/d headed for the no ma:n's land.
T@h@e Chinese embassy in Mongolia always pa]id high att/entio/n to the protection of the lawful rights and intere,sts and safe}t}y o*f Chinese ci(tizens i`n Mon=g=o=lia, as well a(s the consular protect(i(on and assistance.
A,ft,er b?e?ing informed o:f the in$fo$rm$a$tio$n about the two tourists going missing, the embassy immediately activated the cont[ingen[cy pl:an for cons{ul{a{r protection, s\tr\i\v\ed to seize the prime time for rescue an{d s(pared n`o efforts to w"ork.
The emb"a"s"sy ma;in;t;ained close c\o\mm\un\i\cation wit`h the two tourists' families, assisted them i'n immediately report-in-g the case to the Mong*ol*ian p+o+li+c+e, and provided them with a list o*f inter#prete#rs for t]hei]r choice.
Th!e embassy made an appointment with th$e hea|ds of the Mongolian Foreign Relations Depa+rtment, t(he General Bureau of P@o@lice an`d the General Bure]au of Emergency a]t first t>ime to re^p^o^r^t relevant information . The embassy requested t%he Mongolian sid:e to ca'rr'y out the search a}nd rescue operation as soon a?s p}os}sib}le and main'tained cl}ose co[m[mu[n[icatio[n with the Mongolian si_de during the search and rescue process to ensure t"o keep up t'he latest progress.
M,ean,w,h,i,le, the emba$s$s$y assis"ted the family members in publ=is=h=i=n=g the notice for mis`s`ing per]son]s in M!o!ng!olia, and ex%te%ns%ively mobilized overs*eas Chinese and Ch<in<ese-fun<ded enterprises i.n Mongolia t@o actively participate in searching the missing persons, provide effective cl=ue=s . The embassy also p@rovi@de@d relevant assistance to the m>em>bers o.f the Bl^ue Sky Rescue team w*ho went to Mon"golia for assistance.
Unde=r the s_tro_ng boost of t/h/e embassy, th~e Mong{oli{an side immediately sen~t a rescue team an=d promised to exempt the search and rescue co<sts.
The G(ene(r(al Bureau of Police and the Gen{eral Bureau o_f Emerge[n[c[y of Mo|n|golia instructed t|he police and emergendy d]epartm]ent of Hovsgol provi{nce to spare no efforts t=o se^ar^ch and rescue the missing person:s.
Since Khovsgol Lake was located a(t t!h!e b?or?de?r of north o*f Mongolia and Rus$sia, its location was i!n re:mot:e, a$nd it was a vast territory with a sp|ars|e population of which transportation and communicat;io;n was e]xtre]mely inconve&nient . Meanwhile, Mongolia has c-ur-r-e-ntly en[tered t\he winter, an&d the temperature was a?s low as around -20 d:eg:r:ees . Th(e local police and emergency depa;rtmen;t overcame great difficulties, al_m_ost to mobili)z)e all forces an*d stimulate the local herdsmen to carry ou.t th]e carpet s$e$arch and rescue operation around the wide range o|f th+e position where tw~o people lo^st for days on end thro[ugh the ways o^f ho@rs@e ridin<g, walking, and vis%it%i%ng th`e herdsmen.
Meanwhile, in view of special conditions i'n the pastoral areas, t@he Mongolia side h)as b<ee<n circ;ula;rly publishing the n\otice o,f missing persons through the rad|io fo#r days.
Rel{evant staff o+f Chinese Blue Sk#y Rescue team hav?e al$s$o come to Mongolia to actively par~tic~ip~a~te in the r&escue work together with t(he Mongolian side.
T)he safety of the t+wo mi+ssi+n+g pe^rs^ons has always affected our hearts.
To date, t~he two people ha_ve been lost fo=r mo@re than 1!0 days . The em~bassy su*c*ces*sively received some c`lue`s, bu@t still ca(n n\ot find them . The search and rescue operation was s&til&l under way.
The embassy would a?l?way?s foll@ow t@h@e p]ri]nciple of `_` people first", sustain attention t|o this ma}tter, push the Mongolian side to cont,in,u,e the all-,out search and r<esc<u<e opera?tio?n a~nd provide maximum assistance to th]e two persons' families.
T{h{e embassy appeals t#o the comp'a'triot's a}nd enterprises in Mongolia to c%on%tact the C#h#inese e;mbas;sy in Mongolia a<t first time for any relevant clues.
