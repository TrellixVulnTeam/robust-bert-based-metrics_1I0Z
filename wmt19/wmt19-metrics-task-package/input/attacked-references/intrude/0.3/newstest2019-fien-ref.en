I had so`m`e potential possibilities ab#r#oad, but t?hey never materi.a.lised, and th$en I go/t a pho@ne call from Loimaa.
We reached a pretty q&u&i&ck agreemen"t, Kou)ki said.
Toni Rumpun(e(n, who, l-ike Kouk)i, also has played f~or Loimu, supported Ko%uki wit/h 18 points.
The most effective pl\a\yer of t,he visiting t?e?am w(it(h 1;7 points was na)tio)n)al team spiker Samuli Kaislasalo, w;hos;e d,ea,l with Loi`mu is for one match at a time.
It is always im>p>ortant t>o w{i{n the opening match.
Ma/ny players had experience fro`m the opposing side, t!oo, a/nd that brought s+om+e extra to th/e match.
Our game is no;t r)ea)dy yet, but o|ur goal i)s naturally to continue w'inning med_als, Kouki said.
Määttänen the best i|n S{a{vo Volley

O;ur ga(m(e w,a,s un|p|red|ictable especially when on the offensive, b*ut luckily we mana{ged to scrape a vi%ct%ory for us.
I fo,r one di]d n'&t have any co$n$scious energy differences when playing aga{inst my ol\d team, Määttänen said.
Ant}t}i Siltala, who began his caree,r in Vier;emän Lentopallo regional se@ries in 2#000#-01, made 12 poi:nts.
H#ea#d coach Jukk*a T=u=o=v=ine=n was happy with many things.
T;he hall wa>s sma/ll, which means the atmosphere wa!s excellent the whole ti<me.
I '"v"e a nice f#eeli#ng a]ft]er the opening match at h[om[e.
Mi,ro w$a$s a ki"ng, and Silli played a good ga@me, too, T]uo]vinen sai(d.
Siltala ’ s previous League se(a(son w=as 2006-07, w)he)n h;e wo^n silver at Pielaved?en Sampo with T?uovi?nen a?s head coach then, too.

The spiker made 25 points when Akaa-Volley h"ad t~h~eir first w<in of t#he season a&fter beating Kokkolan T~iiker~i~t 3-2.
My seaso~n has h%ad a pretty goo=d start.
Today a los%s w(as close, tho{u{gh, sinc(e we were losing the fou&r&th s\e\t 17-21.
Somewh}ere we ma>na>ged to find a s"et wo<n, and a fif<th set at the s"am"e ti<me, said Mikkonen.

At>tacks agai^nst abortion rights n+ow in the United States - a strong documentary tells u+s w\hy
T`he US Senate is currently att!em!pting t'o investigate, whe"ther Br'ett Kavanaugh, Pr"esid"e"nt Donal=d Trump ']s nominee for one of the nin(e members of the Supr&eme Court can be chosen for the jo]b.
Many i&n th"e Republican pa[rty hope th>a>t w&ith Kavan!augh '"s decisive vote, so-called Roe v. Wade decision tha=t made abortion legal i'n the USA in 1973 could be re\v\ers\e\d.
Ricki Stern and Annie Sundberg '!s Reversing Roe documentary il*lus*trates how t@h@e current situation has developed o!ver th~e year,s.
A,s unbelievable as it feels, the topic i}s timely a\ls\o i'n Fin+l+and.
Minister for Fo{rei{gn A:ff:air:s Timo Soini (Blue Re(f(or(m) has con-duct-ed p.r work against s%af%e abortion, an(d received different levels of support from the greater p%a%r%t of ou{r country's Mem>ber>s o^f Parliament.
I`n th-e beginning of this strong d.o.c.u.mentary, w}e meet gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, who i+s no`w, b)ecau)se of th<e law restrictions, the only Missouri state doctor p,rov,iding abort+ions.
An arm=e=d guar>d at the cli)nic says h?e is def{e{n{ding the freedom of rel%i%g%i%o%n in the United States.
The news videos remind us about l/ethal t=er=rorist attacks ag,a,inst the clinic)s.
Let us move to t@he time abortio>n was i.l.le.gal in t.he Uni+ted States.
At that tim{e, a]n eva:ngel:ical clergymen all-ian-ce directed women t#o reliable abortion doctors.
T}he re:asoning of the interviewed pa[s[t[o[r i"s sound, bu,t a]ct]u]a]l]ly not really needed, a picture of a w>oman died of a self-made abo/r/t/ion i;s enough.
There w}e}r}e about 5,[000 deaths a y*e*ar i\n the United States.
T_he legalisation of abo_rt_io_ns was defended e_spe_cia_ll_y by the R~e~publ~ica~n party.
Alr{e{ady i|n 1967, California Go&v&e&rnor Ronald Reagan s\ig\ne\d t#he abortion rights act.
L:a:t:e:r it was precisely Rea}g}an duri!ng his 1980 pr&esiden&tial campaign w*ho, in a r#evol#u#t#io#na#ry manner, began to mi/x religion with politics i#n order t,o draw voters.
A!not!her to go back o|n his stance o|n abortion was Reagan's fo=llower - Geor)ge Bush sen\ior.
And t>he sa^me was done also by Donald Tru#mp.
The documentary reaches th=e very core of t>he matter w[h[en i;t lo,ok,s fo)r the founding reason for the politicisation o;f abortion.
Wh)e)n religious organisation supporting racial segreg,ation w=ere refused tax exemption, they b;e;c;ame politically ac[tive.
Abortion w:a:s ch*os*en as their rallying cr$y.
Religion h;a;s brought exceptional knots t~o p]o]lit]ics.
While wr,i,ting th+is, the si:tuati:on i,n t$he Un?i?ted States is such that a president, who bragged about h#is sexual harassment but managed to wi]n the vot:es of th(e re`lig`ious Righ=t wi#th his s#ta#n#d on abortion, announced Kavanaugh as a nominee t'o the Supreme Court, who i"s now ch:arged of se`x`ual harassment by many women.

T.he President of the Unite|d States Dona[l[d T%rump winner o^f t'he Nobel Pe{a{c{e Prize - the thou~ght may sound weird a?t first, but, according to the odds, Trump is one o$f the bi:g:ge:st fa:vouri:t:e:s t@o receive the prize.
This is d^ue to Trump ’ s role i<n m<aking N~orth Korea commit itself to de-|nucl|ea|risa|t|ion - at l`ea`s`t in w"ords.
Based on the odds, the biggest f?avour?ites for N'o'b'el Pea\ce Prize are Sout{h Korean president Moon Jae-in a^nd Nor<t<h korean leader Ki_m Jong-un, who have me_t t"h"is ye#ar a)lrea)dy thr|ee times and p)ro)m)ised to try t\o achieve peace treaty between the two countries.

A fire a|larm i:n a tunnel: Motorists acted like behaved l)ik)e lem;ming;s, dr`i`v`ing i[n the wrong direction
A traffic chao=s on natio$nal road 1 a#t Lo_h_ja took place o;n 8 September.
Th|e tunnel area traffic was halted because of t%he ann/oun/cement t[o both Turku an*d H-els-in-ki directions.
When the reason was discovered to be a s+ys+tem e<rror, fire s?erv?ice attempted to nor@malis@e th`e t/raf/f/i/c.
Th`at di,d n'ot happen very fast, though.
We attempted t%o open the road once before, but T|ra|ffic Manag$e$ment Finland said it c|a|n not be do_n_e, bec#ause t>her>e are motorists s@pread o[u[t on t`h`e road, d;rivi;ng an%y which way, f[ir[e officer on duty Pasi Käär.iäin.en told to STT back t[he[n.
People w)ere even driving the moto~r~w~ay i:n th#e wrong direction, after only a m*om*en*t o/f waiting.
When the first one acts con`tr`ary t:o traffic regulations, a fe=w other oft|e|n f<o<llow, Contact Manager f$or Finni:s:h R+oad Sa)fety Control, Tapio Heiskanen wonders.
According to traffic r"egula"tio"ns, stopping o,n a motorway or i{n tu[nnels i#s allowed only for a compelling r?eas?on.
Finnish Ro~ad S:afe:ty Control not+e+s that one cannot da`n`ger the traffic in excep*t*i*o*nal situations with rash d:eci:sions.
Emergency vehicles mu/st always be give<n a<s unimpeded an acc%e%ss as possible.
It is particularly forbidden to drive i|n an opposite direction o$n a mo?t?orwa?y, ju:s:t like mak~i~ng a U-turn o?r rev/e/rs/ing.
The same prohibitio<n stands also in tunnels, where o;ne must additionally always t]urn o;n th'e headligh}ts.
I<n addition, sto}p}pin}g wi{t{hout a compelling reason is f)or)bid)den, as is naturally par%k%ing.
So\me time ago there were even cases w=he=re the dr=iver stopped in a t{un{ne{l t~o brush snow fr+om his ca=r.

Ilves supporters w.ou.ld have wanted to continue their party eve`n w#h#en the ship g@ot s-tu-ck t<o the botto;m of a lake
Ilves f#ans c.a.rrie.d by lake s'hip M/S Tampere would have w;an;t;ed t`o st+ay a,boar,d and continue thei@r victory c>ele>b>r>at>ion, ev`en when the ship ’ s bow wa@s st(u(ck to the bottom of the lake, says J}uho Syrjä, who wa)s the cap!tain of the ship at the ti[me o]f the event.
M/(S Tampere, on its way from Hä.mee.n.linna to Tampere, drifted aw]a]y from its route l-ate Sa_t_urda_y evening, and its b<o<w g|ot stuck to th?e b.ott.om o<f the lake i<n Akaa's Vanajavesi.
1%9 passeng'ers and five crew members aboard w|er|e e=vacuat=e=d to the m&ai&nl&an&d during the night.
No on&e was hurt d]uring the i+n+cident.
Ilv&e&s supporters would h`ave w^anted to continue th\e\ir celebration ab^o^ard unt?il morning, but naturally it wa^s more sensible to send t(hem to the harbour with t~he fire brigade and th+e+n back ho$me in a b.us, Syrjä t\old STT.
Ilve]s fans had bee:n in Hämeenlinna to wa:tch t=he match between Ilves and H$PK, which Ilves won 4}-3.
According t-o Syrjä, the Saturday accide[nt was caused by the fact th"a"t water l=e=vel a]t V{ana{ja{vesi was about 50 cm lower t'ha'n usuall\y.
Syrjä s[ai[d tha+t the n,avig,a,tion was also complicated by the closest channel m\a\rki\ng be:i:n:g covered b?y gull droppings, which meant its reflectors we#r#e not normally visible i;n the dark autum"n ev:en:i:ng.
N@o noteworthy crash
Ship dam:ag:e hap'pen'ed on the w)e)st side of Jumusensalmi shortly after the ship r^oute had passed und,e,r the bridge be(tw(een t#he Tamper&e-H&elsin&k&i motorway.
According t[o Syrjä, t?here wa)s no bigger drama involved in t^he event, because th&e ship's speed w-as very l*ow a;t the ti{me o|f the event, a-nd hitting th!e bottom did not cause any significant crash.
Sy>rjä s}a}y}s getting stuck t:o the bo!t!tom did n/o/t ca?use any leaks or dents t"o the ship, and it looks l'i'ke th%e cruises can continue normally.
A dive{r c)he)c)ke)d the s"hip condition on Satur)day mornin#g, before the s)h)i)p was towed from the shoal.
Just to b^e o{n saf;e side, we a?r?e go#ing to the dock t)o check this caused n*o damage, Syrjä says.
S-yrjä believes the nex+t M`/S Tampere cruise, booked for n`ex`t we"ekend, can be ha!ndl!e!d as agreed.
The ship '/s cruis"e s~ea~son co#nt#in#ues until the independence day, h<e says.

B+r+ett Kavanaugh, no[min[ated a/s a Justice t%o the Supreme Court, may w(ell be left without the position he i,s pursui>ng, estimates p[ro[g[r[amme director Mika Aaltola from the Fi\nnis\h Institute o@f International Aff^a^i^rs.
So far a>t least th=re=e w*omen have accused K}a}vanaugh o!f sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour i)n his student days.
According t;o Aalto_l_a, the suspi{cions have crea\t\ed so much pressure on t`he Republican party tha#t president Donald Trump may decide t=o nominate someone els]e f_o_r the position.
Every now and then ther?e ha\ve bee/n cases in t*h*e United States th;at the p}resid}ent ’ s no#m#inee for a Justice to the Supreme Court ha@s c!ause!d plenty of disagreem,e,nts.

This w,a,y t:h:e president has be]e]n abl+e to save his face.
T^he nomination would benef=it the Democrats
T@h@e Supr)e)me Court of th[e United States attempts to stay above politics, b]ut at least in the Ka@v@anaug@h case, the nomina&ti&on o,f a new Justice ha|s becom$e an extremely sensiti>v>e p<ro<c<es<s politically.
If Kavanaugh i&s nom{in{ated, Aaltola says i't will mo'st likely benefit the Democrats i]n t\he coming Congress m'i'dter'm elections.
It woul+d raise vo"ting enthusiasm among young people a*nd w{omen, who are more l:ike:ly t}o vote for Democrats.
On the other han!d, nom~in~ating a conservative Justice t.o t:h:e Supreme Court would b*e a l/on/g/-/t/erm victory fo+r the Republicans.
There i%s no opportunity for a nomination eve)ry presidential t#erm, because the United S@ta@tes Supreme Court j;us;tices a>re nominated fo@r life.
In pr@a@cti@c@e, some o{f them hav[e retired a"t their own request a{round the age o[f 70 to 80.
Even s+o+me Republicans h|e|sitate a;bo;u;t the nomination
A background ch]eck is an,yh,o,w normally conducted of the n[ominees as Supreme Cour"t ju@stice@s, Aaltol~a states.
Eve%n th)ough T^r^ump has set a time limit of only a we/ek for t`h`e FBI ’ s f?ur?th?er investigations, according to Aaltola it ca@n still reveal somet$hi$ng su/bstan/tial.
Y{e{s, i=t can.
There is rarely smoke wi-t-h-o-u-t fire, A!altola say=s.
According to Aaltola, one thing t\hat is certain is th)at K*av*a*naugh '/s s*u*i*t*ab*il*i*ty or unsuitability f"o"r the position will come u_p i?n ma%ny discussions before the Senate makes i/ts decision.
The Republicans have a Senate maj<ori<ty with 51 votes ag'ai'ns't 4%9, but at least tw|o f.ema.le Republican senator&s are suspected to hav(e a doubtfu;l a?t?ti?tude towards Kavanaugh nomination.
The most embarrassing th\ing wou"ld be if t[h[e no?mina?t?ion wou=ld be voted o&n, and the Republicans lost.
A woman ha^s identified t~he Salisbury su>spect as an agen~t of military intelligence
A Russian woman has told the B}BC sh%e recog=nis=es a Russian m{an suspected of t<he S,a,lisbury poisonings a!s a)n agent of Russian military intelligence.
Based on photogra)ph)s, th&e woma&n told the ma?n i.n question is Anatoliy C}h}epiga who works for the mil[itar[y intelligence GRU.
Online communit$y Belling\c\at a>n>d Russian community Insider R-ussia earlier said they had revealed on)e of th-e men suspected o}f p[oison[ings to be Chepiga.
Already earli_er t<hey said t`o hav$e found evidence of the men's current identiti-es are cover id"e"ntit"ies.
A BBC team travelled to the Far-East to the vil]lag]e ne_ar the Russo-Ch:i:nese border where Chepi#g#a g\r\ew u?p.
A w,oman living in the v:il:lag:e recognised young Chepiga f}rom pictures pub/l/i/s/h/ed by Be?llingc?at.
She recognised the same m=en in the British p-olice's pictu|res t}a}ken from a ma}n cur,r,ent,ly calling himself Ruslan Bo>s>hiro>v.
Th,e Russian men a;re suspected of poisoning the ex-double a>gent Se;rge;i Skri\pal and her daughter with N"ovic"hok nerve a+g+e+n+t in March.

The leaders of th<e j=o=in=t mu+ni+ci+pal authority warn th)e municipal council abou_t the change limiter.
If t^he socia:l welfare a;nd health care cos.t.s increase no^w, the municipality ’ s government subsidies will b]e cu;t in t'he future.
The municipality ’ s C'e'n't're Party d"e"c"ision-m"aker"s h}a}d a fright, and most of them are ready for t~he great st]ruc]t]ural cha@n@g@e of services f}o}r older peo@pl@e, which would end the institutional care at the health centre wa?r?d an[d th'e s)m)a)ll u\nit f+o+r those with me'mo'r'y disorders.

Attendo tr]us]t]e]d the municipality t<o pa_y for its customers.
The Vaala Left Alliance di=d no+t swallow th<e b'ad pr/epar/at/ion, but organised a nice public eve:n:t, a{tte{nded b+y many family members, practical nurses, and also local counc`i`llors from o@t@her p~arti~es.

Carina Läntinen, a loca#l counc]illor from a n~eigh~bour~i~ng munic<ip<al<ity participated.
A local newspaper wrote a/n extensive story about th|e eve:nt, and this i]n turn made O|ulu|n|kaari d,r,a,u,gh,ts,per,sons ’ hackl'es rise.

Should you g;o to w`o`r`k t~omorrow i$f you have the sniffles?
Here ar~e the fact-based p{ro{s a%nd cons
Th?e flu s{eason is underway.
Ma(ny a{re wondering whet,he,r t>o stay at home or not.
The hard wo}r}k}ers should howeve<r consid>er, whether it is wo-rth i]t to i"nfe"ct others, b&eca&use the illness can be contagious, e`v`en tho:ugh their own symptoms w!ere minor.
Sometimes flu s*ymp*to*ms a%tt%ack al;l of a sudde|n, sometimes they s%t%ea%l on you.
I{n th;e latter situation you may a.lready i?n?fec?t othe?r?s, even though your own symptoms would fe@el m+i+no+r, Prevention publication describes.
Should you s,ta,y h%ome then?
Ac=cording to P}rev}ent}ion, before a person even experiences sym=p=tom=s o*f t=he flu, they are c=onta=gio=us.
You c~an p^as^s t{he virus from about a day before the f'irst symptoms u#p until ab\out five to seven d^ays after.
Children with the flu m+ay b@e contagious fo=r longer than a w?e?ek.
A~s soon as y<o<u are aw'a're of any symptoms, you sho#uld not be in school or a@t w$ork.
Return when you a|re n%o longer cough[ing and no longer h&ave a fever, s.ays medical professor Gregory P_oland.
Yo!u should a%lso avoid exercise.
Too quick a return t|o the g{ym c)an hamper the recov?e?ry.
A{lso be su\re to wash your hands and sneeze or cough into a t%issue and t]hrow away th^e t#is#su#e.
Leaving hom\e wh|en ill?
I@f yo"u must le|av|e the house whi;l;e ill, consi>d>er using a face mask.
The m}ask d.oes.n ’ t filter o&ut viruses, b!ut it keeps the use>r aware of the head ar$ea.
When you wear it, you ca n'.t p^u^t your finger i]n your n.ose o}r mouth, Po+la+nd says.
A+ls+o s!neez!es ar;e constrained with the mask.
H[ow can yo,u prevent infection, t}hen?
Th"e best w+ay i%s still t,o wash you%r hands and avoid touching your face.
It i~s hard t}o avoid the lat,te,r, though.
For e"x"a"mple, the average A;m;e;ri;ca;n i=s putting t~hei~r f~ing~e~r in their eyes, n$ose, or m=out=h every 15 to 30 secon=d=s, Poland w+arns.
New Miss Finland follows t%he beauty queen t%r%aditio%n: ‘ My spous-e is a&n i{ce-hocke{y playe:r ’
Hock{ey players and beauty queens a*re often asso_ci_ated w^it^h each other.
This is true als!o for Alina Vo\r\on\ko\va, 2%3.
Alina Voronk|ova, a na/tive o#f P'ert'unm'a'a, is the 2018 recipi<ent of Mis,s Finland ’ s crown.
Currently th{e b/eauty lives in Lahti, wh!e!re she mo!ved when she was 1!5.
Alina '&s mother i*s Ingrian and fat:he:r Russian.
Voronk^ov^a was bullied at school b&eca&us&e of h}er Russian fa(ther.
Mother a*n*d father moved to Finland 25 y>e>ars ago, b~ut I was bullied ab#o#ut m[y R!u!ssiani!s!m.
I ha|d no fr{iends at P;e;r;tunmaa, Alina says in the announcement event fo(r Miss Finland c-ontest sem+i+-fina+l+i+st+s.
After seco}ndary school Alina decided t`o s-t-a-rt w}it}h a clean sl,ate and move to L&ah&ti to attend uppe:r secondary school.
So|o|n t^he bea'uty queen found n^ew friends and h,er daily life started rolling as desired.
Whe}n you ’ r*e 1^5 you thi}nk you 'r^e a grownup, but now, thinkin ba"c"k, I rea;lly wasn't.
Three ye@ars ago Alina met hi?s cu{rr{e{n{t partn*er Joonas Hurri, who i's familiar fr"o"m Pelicans.
After his league career in Finland, the hock#e#y player has playe}d ab-road, l>i>ke in S>weden an?d China.
In 2009, he was par*t of the Finnish t=eam i:n the World U1$8 Cha\mp\io\n\ship.
I"n the earl(y days of their d+a+ting th'e couple lived almost a y*ear in a long-distance relationship, b(u(t later Alina h$a$d a c~han~ce t&o trav|el abroad with his spouse.
If I made i_t to t|he top thre.e a*nd I could make a living o<u<t of that, I do n~'t w\ant to beli%ev%e it h~ad any effect on our r'el'at'i'o'nshi'p.
Even though w;e would h'ave to live apart, our trust i]n each other i[s goo[d, and a good th:ing about a long-distance relationship is that the first sp`a`rk n[eve[r go:es o.u.t, Alina g!ri!n!ned i&n May.

The res>cue de#p#a#r#tment re}c}ei}ved an a.larm abo'u't a water traffic accident o,n Friday evening little after half past eleven.
A 30-metre M/S Tampere h^ad ran aground, and i#t#s b!ow is firm^ly st_uck i)n th+e rocks, described the fir>e master on duty, Matti Wil#lma#n.
T\he ship ha,d 1[9 passengers and five cr<ew members aboard.
Accor&di&n&g to th\e r[escue department, there w*er*e no injuries.
All t`he p[ass[e[ng[ers an)d almost all crew members ha<ve been evacuated t,o the mainland.

Ex managers dema.n.d unpaid f]ees from Rob!e!rt Helenius
A disagreement about m/oney overshadows b%oxe%r Rober<t Hel/e/ni/u/s ’ tonight '~s match against Erkan Teper.
Ilta-Sanomat reported tod-ay o$n th(e complain)t b.y boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Master of Law\s trained on th=e ben'c'h Jussi Ko|kkila, i/n which over 80,000 euros worth of unpaid manager fe|es with penal interest a#r#e demanded from Helenius.
A,cco,r,ding to the complaint, Helminen a\n\d Kokkola worked for H_elenius between 1&5.&4.&2014 an`d 30.1.2015.
We ha^ve attempted to sett{l{e th~is, but there is n"o other op;ti;on.
Th&er&e wa>s a c{l{ear assignment here, an-d a lot of wo@r@k ha(s bee@n done, Kokkila says to Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius ’ current ma$nage$r, Mark*us S_u_n_dman, sent Ilta-Sanomat a repsons%e, which n}arrates th~e b\oxer ’ s view of the e[vents.
Helenius denies t(o have an obligation to pa}y t.h.e re&qui&red sum.
As stated i&n the r!esponse, Kokkila and Helminen h'ad offered their services to Helenius i;n a f&i&nan&c&i&ally difficult situatio_n, and promised to b(e able to organise m+at+c+hes a]nd s|ponso|r income for h<i<m.
According to the v-erbat-im agreement, He~len~i~u~s w:as obligated only t*o pay a pe^rcen^ta^g^e o\f his matches as fees.
Again and again t{h{er{e were assurances t[h[a[t Helenius d\o\e\s n*o*t need to pay anything, j^us^t t)o receive the income they or/gani/se.
This i+s al)so a n?o?rmal and only practice in professional a=thle=tes ’ m/a/n/a/g/e/rial action.
T$her$e never w,as a{n agreement about paid work, and that would also have be<en i|l|l|-a|dvi|s|ed i+n Helenius ’ situat#ion, Sundman e@x@plai@ns in a message he wr)o)te.
There never was a written agreem/en/t ab=ou=t t!he co-operation
Acc[o[r[d[i[ng to the response, Helenius woul$d have wanted to ag~r~e~e o#n the income di=strib=u=t=io=n i;n written from th}e beginning, b,u,t Kokkila and Sundman did not mana}g}e to make a d~r~af~t until the e}nd of 201<4.
He dis|co|ver|e|d the d>r>aft to be bad for h$i$m, and d(isc(onti(n(ued the co-operation wit-h Kokkila and H$e$l$m$i$n$en.
Hele|n|iu|s had n|o matc*hes while ass,ociating with Kokkila and Helminen.
A ye<ar a@ft@er t_h_eir co-operation ended, Helenius received an “ unspecified but bi]g ” invoice for ma\n\age\r w>ork.
T_his year a complaint was filed w@ith the sa*me al-l-eg-atio-ns.
H_eleni_us regards Helminen and Kokkila's subs#equent action a,s cowardly, t>he response sta~tes.

Executive Director Mik~a Ku!lm!al!a praises their fast r*eactio*ns a'nd stringent economic discipline.
Last autumn, we responded quickly t\o the sit`u`ati`o`n an!d ma#de adjustments.
Ca!re!ful p]lann]i]ng of operations and financial control are instilled in our whole organisatio@n, K'ul'ma'la say`s in the pre_s_s rel<ease.
We have also succeeded in partner acquisition, and in addition t%h%e profits fr|om t&h&e wor%l%d c;ups were maximal dur|i|ng th`e p#as#t season.
H-o-wever, we must continue to b|e ca!refu!l when managing expenses, an\d at the same t-ime we must constantly l'ook fo,r new fo/rms o%f financing.
I heard m#y w"ife c.ry f?or help, but then silence
Dozens of bodies lie in the hos:pi:t:al courtyard in t>he ci&t&y of Palu, located o%n Indo@n@e@sian is(l(and o&f Sulawesi.
Onl"y one b"uilding s&epa&rate&s them from t?h?e area, wh~e~re the injured survivors are gathered in o|rder t'o evaluate t&h&eir injuries and need for treatment.
T=he patients a$re also t<re<a<t<ed outside because of the afters-h-ocks.
One of the p~eople movi/ng in the hospital area w*as a 52-year-old P=alu resident Baharuddin, w`h`o was se]arch]i]n]g for hi`s son.
Like m[a[ny I.ndo.nesi.ans, h>e uses only one name.
I ha}v}e o,ne child, he ’ s mis[s[i[n[g.
I last s;p;oke to h@im before h@e we+nt to sch_ool in the morning, Baha/r/ud/di/n told news agency AFP.
Dwi Haris, wh*o was l(ying o$utside the hospital i^n Pal|u, had s;uffer;e;d injuries in his ba\ck and arm.
When the earthquake bega`n, he was i#n a local h"otel w&it&h his w)ife and da#ughter.
The fa+mily had be:e:n invited t|o P:alu for a wedding.
I w^a^s pr<ob<ably caught under a collapsed wal?l.
I heard m%y wife cry f#or help, but th#en silen'c'e.
I don ’ t kno@w what happene@d t$o her and m_y child.
I ho;pe th:ey a!re safe, Haris told ne:ws agency AP, according t{o B.r.iti.sh media.
Small shops ar*e loot;e;d
In Palu ev)acua)t)i)on centre, 35-_year-_old moth%er of a smal_l child Risa Kusuma attempted t+o c%alm down h[er feverish baby.
She described the c@it@y atmosphere a)s tens;e.
There i_s little clea/n water.
S_mall smal}l shops are looted everywhere, said Ku*su*ma.
Many Palu r}e}sid}ents have slept out-side or in t'emp'orar'y b"amb"oo huts.
Even thou+gh the(i(r home!s would st/ill be somehow standing, th~e possib<le aft=e=rs=hoc=ks could destroy them for good, burying the residents.
Ac[c[o[rding to news agency A-P, over half th<e prisoners i)n P'alu prison escaped after the prison wall+s collapsed.
Reportedly there w~er~e about 5'6'0 prisoners, so the^re are p+er+haps ab'out 300 fugitives.
The Jakarta Po#s#t reports t;ha;t also a pa'rt of Do*nggl*a prisoners have e]scap]e]d.
Accord.ing to the newspaper, the prisoners got int=o a rage an\d set fire to the p^ris^on after the gua+rds had forbidden them f!rom leaving t[o se-a-r-c-h f]or th:eir r>elati>ves who had suffer+ed from the earthquake and the tsunami.
Palu airport has b!ee!n re-opened mostly fo~r rel~ie~f flights.
On|e of the first to land o]n th_e airpo[rt was a m[il[itary C-130 transport aircraf#t bringing relief items.
Commercial f.l.i.g.hts to Palu airport are allowed on:ly t]o a lim?ited extent.
Th<e pil<ots had t'o land to the air;f;iel;d without air traffic control, b.eca.use the control t-o-w-e-r wa~s badly damaged in t"he earth quake.
A rain sweeps over Finl^a^n^d duri$ng the ni{ght
A long are%a o!f precip*itation spreads o~ver the country from the west during t>he night b)e)tween Saturday and Sunday.
The ra*i*n wi>ll b)e mostly water, but in cen+tra+l and northern L\apla\nd sleet or snow c]an be expected.
Last night ’ s biting cold i\s n!ot going to re@peat, since the t\empe\r\a\t\ure wi*ll remain w@a@r@mer under th}e cloud cover.
An overcast night k=ee=ps the lowest temper;atu;r;es quit`e effectively under cont(rol.
Th'e temperature ma?y temporarily d|rop below z[ero in the far west, the m`eteorolo`gi`s`t on du'ty, V,ille Ilkka said.
O,n Sunday t\he area of precipitation will t}urn eastw*ar*d during the morning.
T~he weather will b\e fa+ir or par#tl#y cloudy in th'e south and west.
In th.e af^terno^o^n the temperatures up to Oul<u latitude a"re between 10 and 13 deg,r,ees.
A]s to t?emperatures, the coming week looks to b_e simila}r in th$e southern an!d central parts of the co~u~nt~ry, but the weather will b?e mo:re unsettled.
Wind a\nd wave warning are i_n eff?ect on the se"a areas.
There a[re no actual autumn gales to be e?xpe?ct?ed i>n t>he next fe,w days, bu+t otherwise i/t will be a typically changeable autumn wea;t;h;er.
It reall;y looks like is goin/g to b}e a r\eal autumn now, Ilkka s/a/i/d.

Russian fat!he!r Dimit#ri an?d Ingrian mother Svetlana h:a:d faith i"n their daughter ’ s success in Miss Finl>and final.
Parents of t^h^e ne|w M~iss Fi[n[l[a[nd Alina Voronkova, Dimitr,i Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, we*re p.ro.ud following th[e[ir daughter ’ s first mo[m[en[ts wearing the crown.
They arrived t!o audience f{r{o{m Per"tun"maa, and planned to drive ba;c;k home after t&h&e f]i]nal.
The s)pirits wer-e wonderful!
W]e believed in Erika the whole tim$e, but half an hour before th,e re&sult&s we w"e"r"e beginning t+o b%e nervous, S"vet"lan"a laughed.
Svetlana is Ingri`an an,d Dimitri Ru@ss@ian.
Alin'a speaks fluent Russian, even though she has l.ived h(er whole c)h)i)l)d)hoo)d in Fi]nl]and.
S{vet{la{n{a says that as a small child, Alina was i}ntere}sted i(n act-ing and many other thin(g(s, rath+er t`h`an a beauty que+e+n career.
P\eople were often com~men~ting that Alina is so p@retty she s:ho:ul:d be a b~eauty queen.
B~ut she sai[d she wanted to b@e a ra|d|io host.
It wasn ’ t u;nti;l l[a[ter Alina got interested i!n beauty cont=e=st=s.
Th'e parents ho-p-ed Alina w}o}uld b=e admitted in the u=niversit=y be!for!e participating in Miss Finland contest.
This became tru:e, and finally Alina wanted t>o comple~te her B'a'che'l'o'r ’ s degree before beaut*y co*nt*es*ts.
W?e kept asking alrea]dy last year why s}he won ’ t par%tic%i%p%at%e, but sh]e wanted to complete t.he Bachelor ';s.
Th|e par?ents bel~i~ev~e Alina w>o>n because sh`e is a wholesome e,xample for young people and for adults, too.
Sh%e exercises a lot and eats a h(ealthy di_et.
And Alina lik.es to be in the li?m?el?i?gh?t, i_t show~s.
Alina ’ s boyfriend Joonas Hurri i?s a profession;al ice hockey pl~a~ye~r in J?a?pa?n, a~nd he wasn ’ t able to com=e to Fin*l*an*d to support hi^s de<are<st in t@he final.
Alina ’ s parents b\e\l\ieve the p#air ’ s r\elati\ons\h\i\p will withstand the ye`a`r as Mis`s Fin"land.
I/t is meant t>o be!
T'h'e par)e)nt)s hope their daughter w'ou'ld visit them soon.

Sar.i P(ii(ppo left he@r career in Brussels and became a s)tay-)a)t-)h)ome mother i-n Finland - go!t an idea o<f a co[mic and lac`k of drawing skills did not slo!w her down
Luomuhömppä (‘ org-ani-c silly ’) o$riginated fr(om an ut#ter#anc#e o(f my hus|band, when he suggested it could be a person in a st<o<ry I w=as de.velo.ping, describes Sar:i Piippo, a comic blogger f=rom Espoo, st_a_y-_at-home m)ot)her, and f~o~rmer EU t\ra\n\sla\t\or.
Sari P}ii}pp}o says s)he was an E\U\-\tr\a\nslat\or in Brussels concentrating on e:conomy and la.w, until the family ’ s fourth child was born te:n ye@ars ago and th<ey be|c|ame ret!u!r!n!in!g migrants.
I ’ v.e loved be)ing a stay-at-=h=ome mother.
T~his has bee$n the best ti[m[e of my life, but at s<o<m<e point I started t]o wond>er w.ha.t to d_o when I grow up, an)d even my y|o|u|n|ge|st one s.tar.te.d t:o be pretty big.
Then i$n 2(01(4, comic c'ame in.
Piippo says s"he ha'd never even dreamed about maki@n@g a co~m~ic, e've'n though she had be$en reading Donald Du#ck, T]intin, and Asterix ever since s|h|e wa+s little.
I had.n ’ t d|ra|wn since ch:il:d:hood, but when these scripts for Luo,muh,ö,m,p,p,ä then started t&o emerge, the s*it*uat*ion chang/e/d.
First I c!r!ea!te!d som{e do`z`ens of scripts for m@y own pleasure.
M!y daughter V?iivi Valka:ma (b . 2000) i.s a s>kil>le>d draw.er, but I didn ’ t manage to pers:ua:de her to help me until summer 2016, whe$n I bribed V"iivi wi(th a drawin/g tabl<et.
He/r en;t;husi;asm lasted for about a doz-en strips, and th#en I had t.o start trying mysel>f, Piippo laughs a@nd sa\ys the drawing tablet was a great su'pp'orter for h&er.
A draw_i_n_g tabl(et is an easy and ha.nd.y way to t|ry to g/e/t something done.
I didn ’ t e<ve<n try to d{raw o%n a paper, Pii(pp(o des%cribe%s her relationship with drawing, w|h|i|ch s<he usually doe.s in the eve\n\ings.
Scripts pop u@p in m+y mind al_l t"he time, but usually I never fi~n~i~s~h a comic at on<e g(o.
A single thre{e{-panel strip may take even se)ve)r)al h^o^urs.
I ma!y d-o one p-a-nel at a time and I love t&o play wi~th colours.
B]eginn]i]ng t<o draw is always the m]os]t diffficult thing, s~inc~e drawing isn ’ t m_y fo<rte.
Sari Piip#po says that when it comes t"o mo;dern comics i+n newspapers, she a]ppreci]ate]s for ex%am%p%le Dilbert by Sc[o[t[t Adams.
Characters o`f Luomuhömppä include a carrot-figured mo`ther, ob|s|e|s|s|ed wi$t$h everyt*hin*g organic a#nd head full of lettuce hair.
Other ch/arac/te/rs are Mies (Hu|sb|an|d), P`i`ss`is (Te/en Girl), an}d Kaksoset (T,w,ins).
I]n th;e world of Luomuhömppä you a-re what yo`u eat.
The ideas for the comic come from t}he creator's o.wn li*fe a:nd s&oc&ial media.
Sari Piippo does n}ot w_ant to preach o@r for]ce any ideas, even though t^her^e are occasionally mo$r$e serious subjects in Lu)omu)hömppä.
Pii:ppo says sh$e has h_er husband and children read t(he comic.
It ’ s a really great f/e/eli/ng t|o lo&o&k a=t a comic you ’ v&e dr[aw[n a/nd think that t.his is what I did today.

In\do\n\e\s\ia\n ear-t-h qua*k*e: A.n air traffic controller sacrified himself - d[idn ’ t le]ave a fractured tower until he managed t^o s{ave hundreds of travellers
A 21}-y}ea}r-}ol}d air traffic controller Anthoni&u&s Gunawan Agung has become a h!ero of I)ndone)si)an q)uake.
Agung staye$d alone in a&n ATC tow:er until he m"anaged to sa+w off a p-asseng-er plane carrying hundreds o*f p`eop`l`e from th~e island being shaken by the quake.
The young man w@as on d#u#ty in th\e a)ir traffic co)ntro)l at Palu '|s Mu+t+iara SIS Al-Jufrie airport when t&h&e earth quake struck on Friday.
As o>t>her>s fled t:he ATC tower, Agung refused t)o abandon h'is po[st until h(e got a Batik A]i]r passenger plane off the g"r"ound.
Th_is w=a=y he might h>av>e saved hundreds of l_ives, Indonesian aviation au:t:horit:y AirNav told A[F[P.
Mutiara SIS Al-Jufrie airport o-n Saturd-a-y a,f,ter the quake.
T>he AT]C t?ow?er trembled and cracked.
Ev$en$tu$a$lly, Agung j)ump)e)d from the fourth story o@f t_he to?wer in a bid to esc"ape.
He broke h.is l?e?g a\n\d suffered serious internal injuries.
Agung w\a\s ta=k=en to a nearby hos&pit&al.
He was t(o b=e taken t%o a better-equipped facility, but died 20 m]i]nut]es before a helicopter co/uld ar,rive, a representative o|f AirNav t-ol-d The J^akart^a Post.
After the flight was safely i]n the air t)he quakes bec,a,me e*v*e*r stronger, cul|mi|nati|ng in a 7:.5 m:ag:nit:ude jolt.

Re`hn pond.e.red the possibility of Europe escalating in a trade w_ar at Yle “ W$e m|ust see t(he n?ex?t tweet ”
The t*rade war b"et"wee"n the Uni[t[e[d Stat^es and Ch)ina is reflected in the w+orld economy as a whole.
Growth forecas]ts have b|een lowered throughout E\ur\op\e, a-n-d also the Bank of Finland h)as slig[ht[ly lowered its own e{c{ono{mi{c growth estimates.
Sp/eaking a{t Yle Ykkösaamu, Governor Olli Re,hn said that even though incr`ea`s`in`g t#ens#ion h:as no direct effect on Europe(an flow o|f tra]de, it does we"a"ken t<h<e trust, which in t^urn is reflected o|n companies ’ investment decisions.
The same applies to t<he imp(a(ct(s of Fi>nn>i>s>h c%o%mp%a%nies ’ exports.
Rehn thinks s!o fa}r Europe has taken good c<are of i`t`s duties.
It has b}e}en able to create a truce with t\he Un%it%ed S;t;ates, an@d, for it/s part, calmed th@e situation d>own also wit[h China and Japan.
Rehn does n)o)t think that Europe will be gr<ound unde<r t#he f"eet of a trade w*ar.
W+e mu/s/t see t^he next tweet and make estimations a<fter that.
O)ur part-ner in Washington is qu_i_t_e unpredictable, h_e however said in t\he Yle interview.
Europe a"lso ha|s it's own risks.
One of them i#s the third lar&gest euro area economy Italy, w-hic-h i?s al$s$o one of t=he m#o#st in)d)eb)ted s_tate_s in the euro area and the wh?ole Western world.
T.he market h=ad a severe re:action to a b!udget showing a c{lear deficit p|resent|ed by the Italian government on Thu?r?sd?ay evening.
Next ye*a*r's deficit is o,ve,r 2.4 p|e|r cent of GD[P.
Rehn considers Italian situa-t-ion t~o be al@armi@n@g.
Five per ce|n|t of the cou)n)tr)y ’ s loan stock are p(roblem loans, and ove$r t-en per cen!t ar}e unregulated loans.
In addition, t:h:e public finances a!re sha(ky, and ag"a"in it se.e.m.s that t}h}e c[ou[nt[ry is going t=o ex"ce"ed its liabilities in relation to its European partners.
Maybe we should n*o*t yet b=e imagining new cr&i&ses, R.e.hn replied wh>e>n inqu&ired whether Ita"ly i_s leading Europe to a new economic crisis.
An$oth$er m?at?ter taxing Europe is Br[i[ti[s[h departure from the E]U.
Reh+n hope>s it can be settled a_t peace.
A quarrelsome exit wou+l+d ha&ve much more neg)at)i)v)e effects.

A missing mushroom p+icke+r fo*u*nd thanks t$o an ‘ unconventional ex$perimen$t ’
The Finni!s!h Poli@c@e's drone skills are the to)p of the wor}ld: ‘ W`e are asked t$o pr*o*vi*de training ’
According to the D$i$rector of the P*o*l*i*ce Univer=sity College, in addition to looking fo/r missin%g persons, t=he police can u.se a dr#on#e i|n crime sce!ne investigation and in intelligence operations.
On Tu'esd'ay, using a dr~one, Oulu po|l|ice found a missing mushroom picker i;n Raah]e in on$ly a few minut,es.
The Director of the Police University College, Ki]mm]o Himberg, tweeted about th!e case and mentioned f[o[r example th)at ‘ thanks to unconventional exp]er]i]menti]ng and effic[ie[n[t t}r}ain}i}ng, w*e ar<e a!t t|he top o?f the world a|lso in this ’.
Drone i-s a fairly ne/w device, and eve.n n]ew]er in po$lice operations.
T#h#ere ar&e n|o statisti:c:s avai,la,ble about Finnish police being a master in drone use.
A#ccor#d#in#g t:o Himberg, th.ere is a wide consensus about t<his.
This ha"s been obviou(s for example when Fi<n<nish police's expe-rie-nces h]av]e been rep|or|t|ed in international events.
The%r%e is a lot o/f interest towards it els$ewhere, Himbe.rg says.
Th{e{r{e are many, w/h/o are are k$ee$n to vis)it Finland to see t;h;e police ’ s dron%e operations.
W&e are as+k+ed to provide t{rai{n{ing.
Become{s more a:n:d more common
Himberg points ou@t th+a+t in Finnish winter con[ditions, finding a m^i^s^si^ng person as soon a;s poss_ible is vital.
A%s stated, in Raahe case t]he m#i#ssing person wa)s found in just a couple o-f min#u#tes u"sing a drone.
Finnis+h Police has already trained hundreds of dr}o}ne pilot@s.
A)cc)ording to Himberg, t`h`e plan is t(o trai$n more.
Already now t/he drone i|s used a lot i|n police o=pe=rat=ion=s, and their u~s~e will increase a$nd become mo=re common i*n the future.

At th<e same tim%e h_e c!r!i!ti!c!ises h#i#s predecessor chairman Jorma Ollila's leadership style.
Ollila categorically deni+ed the claims, bu!t al+so earl:i:er reports on Nokia have discussed t(h(e leaders ’ in(abil(i(ty to work as a team; t"he cul]t]ur]e o_f fear and silence that in part caused the downfall o\f t<h<e m[obil[e p~h~one business.

Ther>e was a lot of t{alk about go'o'd leadership.
Leadership t)h)e)ory legend G/a/ry H~amel said that a good leader must have t^he cou=rage t]o take a company to th}e future al&so when eve=r=yt=hin=g is going fine.
Th<e p.r.ob.le.m i*s that decisions are made by those, wh/o are most mentally bound to t;he de/c/isions of the pa[s[t.

Professor o|f Finance Aswath Damodaran reminded th!e l@iste@ners that a go`od leader's characteristics must ma_tch t.he company ’ s l"i"f"e c%yc%l%e stage.
In the early stage of t|he company a leader must be abl=e t?o tell a story o>n which th|e compa~ny's future i&s f_oun_d_e_d.
A c*o*mpa*n*y grown to a ma*tur*e stage needs a l@e@ader w~ho kno<w the numbers.

Students a&c&t a rar`e tr+eat: a classical tragedy - s%i%m%ple Oresteia impresses w@ith its vi%su%ali%t%y.
Classical tragedies a-re a rare tr@eat on Finnish st*ag*e*s.
Fo@r example, t%h%er%e has not be?e?n a classical tragedy in th%e Finnish Nat&ional T'heat're since Sophocles ’ Ph/il/oc/t/et/es in 1998.
Now Thea/tr/e A<cadem<y takes the only c"o"m"p"lete classical tri|logy, Orest}ei}a by Aeschylus, to a tour that b$e$g$in$s f&ro&m th!e National Theatre.
Beginning i]n 2015, the Lavat auki! prod&u&c&t&io&ns ha&v&e actor students from the Theatre Academy w/orkin/g int[e[rna[t[i[ona[l[ly together wi<t<h a professi[onal dire*cto*r.
This fo}ur}th production, just l{ike the f)i)rst on-e, i*s directed b:y M}i}kko Roiha, who resides in Berlin.
Ores|teia h+ad its international premiere in B"erli"n in April.
Roi'ha ’ s adaptation of Oresteia lau?dably condenses t]h]e t:ale o/f ho-w the curse upon t:h:e d;o;o;med House of Atreus is lifted a/nd a constitutional state is formed to 8!0 m]inu]tes by condensing especially the cho*rus parts.
Th!e playmanages to b:e qu/it/e faithful to the spirit o`f Kirsi Simonsu%u%r%i ’ s excellent translation (20\03).
Dramatic lights and presentation rev#eal#in#g the sides of the t.heat.re space emphasis)e the simple a{n{d clear s`tag`e th=inki=ng.
In the ce^ntre o`f it alternates the dyn*am*ics between acto*rs pl?ayi?n?g main role;s, stepping forward from the chorus i:n turn, a"n"d the chorus.
The performance uti}li}ses both double a#n#d triple por]tra]yal]s of the main r*oles.
The actors nev!e!r leave the sta?g?e, so al"so for example the mur-ders of Agamemnon, who retu|rns fro(m the w\a\r of T.r.oy, a}n}d h)is prize of war, C*as*san*dr*a, ar-e shown o`n the stage, unlike i$n the classical tradition.
Of course the p`erform`anc`e d^oe^s not eve>n claim to be fai$t$hful to the cla;ssica;l pe_rf_or_mance tradition.
If anything, t=h=e view$er i-s p\r\esented with a modern interpretation, f!a!i!thfu!l t|o the text, an<d continuously a-w-ar-e of its ritual-like roots.
Roiha ha<s m|anage|d to create a rhythmic group from the Master-level actor students, a gr&o&u&p that per.for.ms a)s a tight-knight tea@m, e}ven a;s a single o^rga^n^is^m.
T+he chorus pa/r/t/s especially a,re where the actors and their very expressive, scu\lpt\ur\e-like group formations do themselves justice in th=e ba~re sta+g+e adorned only by a wh)it)e cu;r;ta;in.

Fists were doing th>e talking o,n seve/r/al occasions in Kajaani
A ma{n in his thirties assaulted three m`en i/n a restaurant in the centre of Kajaani and i<n front o^f i+t on S*a*tu*rd*a*y after m;id;night.
First t\h\e m&a&n hit a man insi`de th<e restaurant, after which he was remove*d from the pr~emis~es.
Out*sid*e he pus*hed an[o[ther man to th,e ground, and as a third m>an intervened i/n the situation, the at?t?acke?r hit h}im, too.
Th*e police seized t$he attacker.
The m>an continued to ac+t in a?n aggressive manne)r in the police station, kic%k%in%g o*ne of the police in the le-g.
The man a_lso threatened t%o assault an}d kill the pol+ice.
T#he man wa@s taken into p&ol&i&c&e custody to c}a}lm down.
Th"e incident is investigated a:s thr?e?e assaults and a vio"l"ent re?s?isting of an offi?c?i?a?l in the perfo\rmanc\e of his duties.
A.lso another assault took place o~n Välikatu in t#he centre of Kajaani on S?a?tur?day aft`er midnigh%t.
A vict_im was assaulte`d by t[w[o men.
First a Kajaani m!an in his twen$ties h/i/t the vic/tim.
A while l\at\er another man k{noc{k{ed him down, an|d th=e man wh+o earlier h<it him further kicked the v+ic+t+im.
Outsiders p=u=lle=d the attackers aw)a)y from th)e victim and th.e police w]as called.
Th[e offenders however mana"ged t,o leave before the p]ol]i]ce arrived.
The police asks the eyewitnesses t\o contact Kajaani poli~ce by ph&one 0295 41*6 5&20 or b*y email at tutkinta.kainuu @ p&ol&ii&s&i.&f&i.

The security of lad=i=es and men i(n s#hops must b^e guaranteed
T+he first tim!e I was paid for a n>ewspa>per stor~y was in 19/84.
With th<is level o@f experience, when a new|s story manages to astonish m,e, i-t is u=suall=y a big t*hi*ng.
W]h]en I wr`o`te (Karjalainen, 27.9 .) about the insecurity o!f w"ork"ers in r]eta]il, I w$as as%tonished a{n{d occasionally even a bit angr%y.
For th>at st?o?ry, I al?s?o t|alked wit<h Erika Kä'hä'r'ä, Service Union U&n&ite&d (PAM) specialist in working environments.
She says t#h#e cr-i-me statistics d*o not r^eveal the actual situation.
This i=s a grow{ing problem, even th!o!ugh employers naturally claim oth+erwise.
The police are infor{med o;n;ly about t"hose cas%es that a^re clearly ser|io|u|s, and many real violent sit+ua+tion+s are left unreported.
‘ Based on th{e Occupational S$af$ety and Health Act th*e c}o}mpanies certainly ha!ve a respons}ib}i}lit}y to c\o\mpi\l\e stat%istics o.f their close cal}l situations, but these sta}t}ist}ics a$r$e for internal use onl'y, a/nd their information is not collected anywhere ’, she said.
Th]e mental injuries are not inc!luded in the stat+i+s+ti+cs.
Violent situations always have ha$d t.he problem that t=he=re do no\t always r?e?s?ult in physical in?j?urie?s.
Despite this, psychological traumas can b_e m+uch m+or+e severe than b<ru<ises and cut"s.
I-t is difficult to dra~w a line between a violent si}tu}at}i}o}n a(nd a+n impending violent situation, since al!so aggressive thr!eat!s o\f a certain level must b(e considers as violence - e{ve{n though there was no ph}ys}ica}l v'i'o'l'ence.

This s{e{e{ms to have had an effective influ)ence, but this bri-ngs a$bout a n[ew ne+gati+ve trend.
Whe>n se'curity managed t.o control the disturbances, an impression wa[s creat"ed that this security woul&d be unnecessary.
Now many pl'ace's are looking for solu#t#ions to eliminate expensive s{e{cu{rity s:e:rvi:ce:s.
Pe{tty as{s{a{ult is an actionable offence, an'd it is quite understandable tha!t a?n as?sa?u?l?ted sale<sper<son does not w\ant t+o make a request for i*nves*tig*a*tion about an offender who usually lives close t:o the shop.

Th,e next t{im{e a shop lady o+r man is assa)u)l)ted, the police should inv\e\sti\gat\e and the p"rosec"u"t"o"r prosecute.

He+idi Sohlberg taunted a beaut:y que~en b+efo+re live broad=cast - ‘ Sara, remember that I_iro is married ’
This year, th`e beauty queen coronation won ’ t b>e s}e}en traditionally on T{V, b.u.t i#t ’ s b+r+oad+cast via Viafree s[i[te.
The show will be hosted b#y e=x M}i}ss Finland, Heidi Sohlberg, an`d t}h}e host of Vias(a(t '_s a}n}d Viaplay '=s NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
The host for bac$kstage and r,ed carpet is J+anni Hu-ss-i.
Before live broadcast, th)e ho,st trio informed t}he invited g?uests and media representatives prese~nt abo_u_t how the broadcast will p"rogre"s"s.
In the beginning, Sohlberg a@ske@d the audience t$o give H%arju%l%a re$so$u$ndin$g ap!plaud!s.
Scream n(o(w, lad+ies!
Look at our mal,e host, Sohl]b]e]rg enthused ov{er h;e;r c(o(lle(ague while the audience cheered.
M-an-y Mi!ss Finlands from earl=i=er years fol'low the contest f:rom the first row.
Among oth_er_s, Sara Chaf+ak and Sara Siep|p|i were s~itting n`e`xt t$o each oth:e:r, a_nd Sohlberg cracked a joke to either of them.
Sara, remember th%at Iiro i+s m^a^rr^ied!
Sohlb=erg cracked, looking a}t Sar+a+s.
Most likely S'ohberg directe|d he%r joke t^o recently divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comm&ent, e=ve=n t-hough she first looked con*fus*ed.
Sieppi discussed her divorce the first tim*e in Il.ta-.San.o.ma.t we$e$ked n?ew?s?p?aper.
The beauty queen s`a`id she doesn ’ t w=ant to publicly open up about the reasons fo"r the d)ivorce, because that i~s jus"t be;tw;ee;n he.r a'nd Roope Salminen.
She said she ’ s in no hur-r-y t-o find a n(ew relationship, bu$t th>at she is go`ing t@o focus on h[er[sel[f.
I will focus on my own things, an\d above al{l, wi[ll be{g{in to li(v(e my li'fe by mys>elf, Sara Siep"pi said.
Harjula's marital status em$e$rg$ed als&o later, w_hen Sohlberg accidentally called Jan%ni H#us#si and Iiro Harjula a co'uple.
The hos^t trio shared a lau&gh at the b`lu`n`de`r.

An Ostrobothnian man t_o_r_tured hi*s dome@stic p*artner by sl&a&shi&ng, burning an*d feeding a strong sauce to her
Pohjanmaa (Ostrobothnia) Dist!r!ic!t Court h;a;s sentenced the 34-ye`ar-`ol`d Kokkola resident to thr"ee ye!ar!s of imprisonment for the numerous cr&i&m&es ag!a!inst his domes.ti.c partner.
The m-eans of c"o"mmi"ssion of the off.ence includ%e, among oth!e!r!s, a belt, a cable, a*nd c$abl$e ties.
The court sentenced these obj&ects forfeit\ed t}o the state.
The most sever#e charge con;c;erned a sus]pe]c]ted aggravated rape.
Th[is charge was however dismissed by the distri<ct c[ourt.
T.he Kokkola man was considered guilty of four assau"lts, and aggravated assault, coe=rcion, illegal th}re}at, deprivation o&f libe{rt{y, aggravated dep/rivati/on of lib;erty, a?n?d two malicious dam.age.s.
The crimes w*ere co?m?mitted between th"e 26th of l`a`st March and 24th of la(st May.
A<ft<er t,h,e fin>al de%eds, the man w/as ap+p+rehended and detained a couple of days later.
On Thu|rsday of t*h*e past week, Pohjanmaa District Court p>assed its judgement and ru#led that t(he 34-year-old must continue t_o b|e ke^p^t i|n Vaasa prison.
No proof abo'u't t~he rape
The 3+4-year+-old w@a@s a"ls"o accused of two aggra>va>t>ed deprivations o#f liberty and of an a`g`gra`vat`e`d r|ape on the 22nd of May.
The court h~ow~ever d'r'opped these charges as uns[ubstan[tia[t[ed.
T'he case was tr:ie:d be>hind closed doors.
T)he di>s>trict co!urt judge gav-e a public report on the sentence, t#houg#h.
According to th'e dist'r'i'ct court judge, th:e accused had directed violence, threatening, an~d coercion to h;i;s d[om[e[s[tic partner in si/tua/tions where sh'e wa^s tied.
The acc@used sl$ashed his victim w`it`h a knife, burned her with a c$i$ga$ret$t$e, f|ed her st%r%ong sauce, an[d poured water a.nd coffee o.n her.
Wi?t?h i+ts sentence, t"he court ordered tha[t the means of commission of the o{ff{en{ce wer>e t_o be fo$rfeit$e$d to the st[ate: a belt a?nd a c!able, ca;ble ties, a bathrobe belt, a k]ni]fe, and a billhook.
Four w(i(t(nes(ses
According to the d(is(t(rict co\u\rt, the parties c:onti:nu:ed living to|geth|er be^twe^en the deeds.
The judicial de*cision states th^a^t a large number o\f t/h/e most serious d$eeds happened in the end of t]he crime p]er]i]od.
Four witnesses w?ere heard i<n t-h-e court, two women a>n>d tw`o men.
The 34-year-old m/ust pay 5800 euros as compensation for pai-n, a-c-he, su\f\feri\ng, a&nd temp@orary damage.
D)o)ubtful)ly he has such money, since t]h]e conv)i)ct already h\as earlier debts in colle+ct+ion.
The imprisonm;en;t is not the ma`n's fi{rst.
Iltale|hti will not pub:li:s:h the name o}f the convict i/n orde:r t.o protect the victim ’ r privacy.
Duri{ng the ti@m@e of writing, t=he recent district court sentence i's not no]n-ap]pea]l]able.
Europ{e in a f?ou?r?-?poi?nt lead to Ryder Cup fi"nal"s
E.u.ro.pean gol[f prof-es-sional-s strengthened their lead against Uni)t)ed States i-n the traditional match play game o^n Saturday.
Europe leads 10*-6 in R[yder C$up played near Pa=ris, when th\e\re are still twelve Sunday twosomes c\oming.
Europ=e won three of the four four-ball matches t_hat b,egan Saturday, and i-n t$he aft^ernoon foursomes the wins were s-har-e-d 2-2-.
European gui*ding lights were To*mm*y Fleetwood a<nd Francesco Molinari, wh=o won al`l the f$o$ur matches they played a.s a pair during Friday and Satu/r/day.

O{n Sunday the twosome a.t.t.e.mpt t=o make more history.
N%o European player ha%s wo{n fi?ve points i|n a single Ryder Cup, and on%ly three Ameri#cans have managed such achie>v>e>men>t: A~rnold Palmer a@nd Gardiner Dickinson (196'9) and La}rry Nelson (1979).
HJK condemns its supporters viol|en|t tr&oubl&em&aking i-n the match against Honka: ‘ V{io{lenc{e d`oes no/t belong to football ’
Veikkausliiga premier division f+o+o+tb+all team HJK issued a p+r+e+ss release on Su_n_day, de:no:un:cing its supporters disrupti$v$e behaviour in t^h^e match against F~C Honka in T`api`ola o+n Saturday.
‘ On behalf o-f o:ur suppo+rte+r+s, we apo"l"o"gi"se t}h}e events th<a<t t_ook place after the Honka-HJK match ’, th:e press release states.
Aft^er the matc"h, circa 50 HJK s'u'pporter's ru+s+h+ed to the f,i,el,d, and some seemed t.o be trying t[o start a fig,ht wi^t^h Honka supporters.
A{nd a fight a/ls/o broke out bet#ween the supporters.
Secur^ity officers did not manage t;o ca}l}m t*he situati=on down, but police officers and also mo_unt_ed p>ol>ic>e officers were needed.
HJK's p[ress release states the te^am play:ers an;d officials are shocked ab"o"u"t the incident.
The after-match incidents are agains<t t)he va#lues of o.ur long-established te(am of 111 years.
‘ W.e absolutely dissociate our>s>el>ves from all su\c\h activi^t^y that endangers t$h$e match safety ’, the p"ress rele:a:s:e declares.
HJK promises to aid the au}thori}ties and event organisers i&n i^n^ves^tigating the pot<entia<l ele%ments threat,ening s@a@fet@y, an:d in removing unwanted side effects.
Fan cu&lt&ure i>s a part of football an@d a<n important thing t!o HJK.

A Ph@ili@ppine inventor flies with a dro{ne car - this is ho%w you a.voi.d traffic j'am's
Mendiola i`s a Ph)ili)ppine inventor, hip hop d)a)ncer, and a Gyr'o Gearloose o&f s,om,e sort.
H,e is one member o"f t_h_e g^ro^wing group who swear to have in^ve^nted a flying ca>r - or a<t least their own ver(si(on of it.
H?e has competitors such as Audi a*nd A&irbus.
How$e$ver, Me*ndiola do{es not believe in th?e mass manufacturing o-f his vehicle.
Acco)rd)i)n)g to reports from from the wo@rld, h<e has used a great deal o#f h=i=s for$tune to bu#il#d his dream.
Six years ag[o he b%e%g%a%n developing his flying c,a,r.
N/o/w h?e calls hi)s development version a dron car.
H!e says h"e recently co.nd.u.cted the first s#u#ccess#fu#l test flight - he flo#a#te#d in over s|even metres wi[th his machine.
One of his goals w*as t%o avoid traffic ja@m.
I hope the machi?ne evok~es po<s<iti<ve reactions.
F/iv/e years ago this was j#us#t a dream, M[endiola sa,id accordin^g to British Daily Mai~l.
J_H_L anticipates: Industrial act.ion beg&inning t(omor(row will be visible i.n children ’ s daycare an[d in social and h'e'a'l'th services
Overtime and s%h%ift%-t%rad%in%g b>a>ns beginning to#m#o#r#r#o#w in the public a>nd welfare sectors con\c\e\r\n especially social an\d healt<h services and childre.n's daycare, estimates Päi$vi Niemi-Laine, Pr#e#sident of JHL (t&h&e Tra,de Union for the Public and Welfare S<ecto<r<s).
The i\m\p\ac\t will be wide, and it will m.ost certa;inly mani#fest in not having enou|g|h staf@f available.
Everyone has t]o think a`bo`ut h>ow to collect thei?r children.
The employer ’ s task now is to t>ake ca"r"e of the services and tha]t n'o on{e ’ s li%f%e is in dan`ge`r, Niemi-Laine s"a"y"s t>o STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lac(k of employees w"as visible al*so i<n t/he b/e/gin/ni/n/g of t\he y|ea|r, when JHL members w]ere banned from overtime and shift-trading because of agreement n'egoti'at'ion's.
Through their flexibility, the em*pl*o*y*ers have made possible t-o n`ot hire sta+f+f, but u>se employ_ees ’ overtime or s]hif]t-tradi]ng.
This is not y{et a=n industrial a,ction.
When talk@i@n@g abou)t occupational sa`fe`ty a;nd health, it is a nor(mal th.i.ng to take care th?at ea`c`h employee has regular working hours and works only t-ho-se regular hours.
With t.he.se acti*o*ns, J-HL opposes the governments attempts to weaken the lay-off protection i'n s`mall b}usiness}es.
Labour market director for m(un(i(ci(pal employers M]a]rkku Jalonen wil,l n\ot es<ti<mate the effects of o'verti'm'e and sh)i)ft-)tr)a)di)ng bans in advance.
However, he d_oes not belie*v*e t]hem t-o b@e very revolutionary, even i.f the services can weaken.
Employers aro^und Finland are aware of th$is a;nd have made t\he po$s$si$ble preparations.
T"he publi_c, w.e.l.fare and technical sector co+ver+s suc"h a wide area that i=t is difficult to say anything.
The effects can ver[y quite a lot depending o@n fie!ld, r<egion, and empl}oy}er, Jalonen told ST)T.
Jalonen sa_id some exp'eri'e'nce's were received a/lready l-a-st week when the Finnish U{ni{on of Practical Nurses Sup)er and t[h[e Union of Health a[n[d So[cia[l Care Pro<f<e<ssi<onals Tehy, among others, organised similar three-day a+ct+i+on+s.
Their e:ff:e:ct:s remained quit.e small.
J&HL ove^r^tim^e and trade-shift ban a>p>pli>es to for example employees i'n mun-icipalities, churc'h, and state, as well as i<n private soc<ia<l a?nd health sector.
F\o\r example family daycare providers have been e"xc"l"u"d"ed from t;h;e b$an.
A}t this stage, t\he industrial act$ion app.li.e.s t#o nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According t$o Niemi-Laine, J!HL ac$t$ion$s can potentially la^st for a long t{im{e.
The unio*n is prepared to take o(th(er industrial action*s, if drafting o(f the lay-'off b%ill continues.
The g=o=vernment should now recognise t=hat they are r/u/n/ning ag,ains,t a wal#l in high speed.
In Jalonen ’ s o'p'in'ion, b|oth the t?ra?de u&nion movement and the government must meet t:he o^the^r halfway.
T?he u,n,usua,l thing here i"s that p*eople are already pulling ou=t their big g&uns, e'v'en though the pr$o$po$sition has yet to be m|a|de, wonders Jalonen.
Gre`a`t Barrier Reef is formed b#y children an=d a`d`u`l`ts - performance exercises co]ns]is]t of learning the mot.ion.s of a ray a}nd a se"a horse
Great Barrier Reef by Other S^pac^e^s collective ha~d i.ts premiere last spring in Hamburg, and l>as>t Saturda"y was it#s second performance in F=in=l=a=nd, t"hi"s t"ime in Kanneltalo.
J[us[t like t;he previous performance o|f the group, Great Barrier Re!e!f is a performance that is cre,ated t"o"geth"er with th[e audience from the beginning until t\he en"d.
This ti\me, however, a]l]so a more cle(a(r(l(y-d(ef(ined performance is formed t)o refresh a{nd distil th~e perceptions from the b{e{ginn{i{n{g exercises.
Th]e]re i*s plenty of fantasti?c?a?l magic in this theatre p`lay also for c(h(ild(re(n participants.
A chi<l<d ’ s view h.as been c.on.s.ide.re.d also in the preparatory s{tag{e of t"h"e performanc*e.
Still, G:r:eat B{arrier R/e/ef is not a chil.dren ’ s performance, b>ut a performance formed i"n co-operation betwe{en the adults a~nd the children.
I$t g!ives the adults knowledge and obse?rvati?ons about the way children r&eceive i$n$for$ma$t$i$o$n and create ar[t.
The child`ren ’ s ability t)o throw themselves in the exercises a-n-d common games als"o dispels th(e distance between grown-ups an*d ch}ildr}e}n.
G'reat Barrier R(eef has a little bit of a fair'y'-t'a'l'e b{allet, circuit training, and nat(ur(e(-them(ed l)esson in i^t, b"u"t its final setting is org}anise}d around different visits to n!on-huma!n situati*ons.
Great Barrier Reef begins wi(th learning about corals and about movements of organi)s)ms a_n_d fish who l_i_v_e withi+n t{he re)ef.
S\ix diff@er@ent e+xercise groups teach f\or exam`pl`e about the motions of a ray and a s'eahors'e.
Finally a perfo`rman`ce l]asting a l%itt%le under an hour i#s formed, and i]n it th'e music, lights, shiny paints a"nd cost*um*es help in getting to know the life wi:th:i:n t|he coral re]ef.
In Great Barr#i#er R[eef, the participants are bo<th diving peopl|e observing t-he li`fe within t?h?e reef, and corals that are b$e$ing observed.
Th?ey also p,lay the part of organisms observing cor_als.
T\he loo"ks at m%an%y di?f?f?e?r?ent directions and perceptions create a performance that is dense a/n/d teeming wit'h life.
To b#e an organism ’ s view, a<nd o'rg'an'i'sm ob*ser*v*ing a view, or an organism or vi+ew o&b&ser&vi&ng another organism - an#d a$ll this a!t the same t(i(m(e.
Childr!e!n see~m t?o have no problems to do this.
Ot^h^er Spaces collective ’ s exerci]s]es aim t\o rea*c*h the limit between thinking and action, b#ut it is challenging to reac[h it when the g{roup is com>p>rised o,f both chil"dr"e"n a*nd adults.
On the o[ther h{a{nd, children ’ s p>a>rtic>ip>ati>on mak,e,s it mo}re meaningful.
After th-e workshop, a s(ilent demonstration f^or endangered co\ra\ls is organised at Sitrat`ori.
One should not let themselves b!e h{ar{de{ned by the destruct~i~o~n surpassing human understanding, even t?ho?ugh it can b&e dif;f;ic;ul;t to understand t(he significance o'f practising o_ne ’ s own compassion in th{e face of t<hese visions of de$st$r$uc$t$io$n.

Ch<ildre<n grow u+p t"o"o fast - I ’ m hap#p#y there were no smart p_h_one_s when I was a ch_ild
Present-day ch^ildr^en a'nd young people are more a[n[d mo$re irresponsible.
Yo,u,n,g p'eople start smoki<n<g and dr.inking wh+en they ’ re younger and younger.
I think children sh@ould be children thoughout their childhood, a^nd n:o:t mess up their li:ves bec?ause of intoxicants a/nd s"ex, b,eca,us,e all t}he others say th&ey are doing that.
I w=as taken aback, when m!y friend told me s_h_e h!ad had t%o pick up her fifth-former si@st@er fr%om her ‘ boyfriend ’ s ’ house durin%g w+eeken+d.
When she ca#me to g=e=t her drunken sister, she told ab"out her sex exper>ien>ce>s from t\hat ev\ening.
I coul&d ’ v~e not imagined my ow%n sister i=n the same situation, beca)u)se throughout our childhood w)e '.ve been told a]nd advised that w>e should no;t touch intoxicants and s(ex is an adult t\h\i\ng.
I hope present-day ch-il-dren could l(i(v(e a proper childhood, a[nd t_he_y wouldn ’ t need t-o grow u]p too e*arly because of the p(e(e(r pressure created b}y friends.
I keep seeing younger and yo|u|ng|er girls on Inst}a}gr}am, wearing make-=u=p and revealing cl]othes i^n their pi~c~tu~r~es.

Yle: Official have tol}d the political leaders that the c)a)s)e Airiston He.lmi has nothin)g t"o do w|it|h national se*c*u*rity.
In an interview with Yle, Ilkka K@ane@r@va said Finnish S}ecu}rity Intelligence Service and Finnish Defence Fo|rces came t,o inform t@he Def>en>ce a[nd th]e Foreign R(ights C^ommi^ttees earlier this week.
The Finnish st~ate leadership has been told that A)iriston Helmi investigation curren|tl|y ha!s nothing to d]o with na:tio:nal security, but org\anise\d crim,e, Yle rep]orts.
Th>e anonymous sources ’ information w[as conf}irme}d to Yl@e by t^he Chai)r of the Defence C\om\m\i\t\tee, Il,kka Kanerva (National Coalition).
According to Kanerva, the Defence Forces and th|e Security P^ol^i^ce visi:te:d the Defence an\d the For;eign Rights Committees t,o tell ab:o:u:t t/he ongoing investigation.
Th!is i^s prim/arily considered as financial crime.
Th)e)y were rather s=tr=ic=t ab!out n;o;t speculating abou|t anything else, Kanerva commented in t*he Yle interview.
According t?o Y{l{e information, th^e attached material so far has not shown an|y connection to national security, b,ut th>e investiga)tion i:s just beginning.
We hav*e n;o way of knowing what might y`e`t b%e r|e|vea|led, one of Yle's inte.rvi.ew.ee.s stated.
The exten:siv:e house searches started a week ago i]n th[e Tu;r;ku archipelago and on mainland beg the q"u"e"stio"n ab(ou(t whe&th&er the investigation is simp[ly about financial c;rime or if i{t has something t*o do w-ith Finnish internal security.

V$ideo: a dream g}o}al sa+ved Liverpool fro-m t]he first loss in the series
Liverpool winning streak in the Premier League c"am"e t$o a!n end, bu<t it was still t,h,e ha[ppier team af[ter a 1-'1 dr'aw at Stamford Bridge.
This Sunday it wil-l b[e exac:t:ly one year after Manchester City ar]r]ived at Stamford B!r!i!dge and left with a 1>-0 away w<in.
Back t=hen Pep Guard^iola ’ s com[bi[nat[ion s;en;t a signal t:o the whole Prem\ie\r League that City is now s:eri:ous.
Everyone remembers how th:e las(t season e>n>de>d.
And surely Liverpool ma_n_age_r Jürgen Klopp h\a\d the same idea w$hen coming to W*est L&o&ndon.
The Reds h(ad s!tarte!d the Leagu=e with six consecutive wi`ns.
Liverpool h(a(d a stronger start, and especially Virgil va;n D'ijk s!eem!ed to control his e^n^d of t(he field al=one.
A?s for Chelsea, on Wednesday th^ey won a fine Football Lea]g]ue C)up away w[i[n on Anfield Roa|d.
The(n Eden Hazard came of?f the b)enc)h t^o dec/ide the match with a be(a(u(t(if(ul individual performance.
Obviously n_ow H>a>za>r>d was playing from the very fi'rst min~utes.
On t|h|e 25th minute he first pl&a&yed a ti;g;ht triangle with M|ateo Kovacic a"nd Jorginho.
Finall.y t<he Croatian saw H]aza]rd ru^sh^ing forward and sent h^i^m a perfectly balanced through ball.
Hazard st]rayed a bi<t to t#he edg,e o]f the penalty box, but fro(m there managed to sweep a perfect le_f_t-_footed volley i/n t-o the lower corner.
Po$ol '#s Brasilian goalie Alisson was a bi&t slow with his save a(nd on|ly managed t\o touch t#he ball with his fingertips.
Klopp must ha'v'e fel>t t;he losing position being slightly unfair, since almo?s?t right after Antonio Rüdiger clea^red M+o S&al&ah '"s shot from th%e goal line.
I$n t{he second half, a@l@so Chelsea kee(per Kepa sa=w some serious action.
Basque go!al!ie ha@d a qui(ck reaction t#o Sadio M>an>é ’ s shot, and pushed the b"all f"r"om t#he foot of the goa.l post to a corner kick.
As fo*r th*e other e<nd, Alisson resetted Ha,zard's fast b;r;eak with his dive.
The gu?ests ’ best chance ca<me on the 72nd minute, as Jame[s M-ilner's crossing found Bobb+y F^i^r^mino.
Ho'w'e've'r, t_he star B?razilian ']s header w)a)s directed towards his national team mat>e David Lu,iz, which saved the h_o_me team's lead.
E(ve(n that did n.'.t hold anymore on t&h&e 89th mi/nute, when substitute D[a[ni[el Sturridge had a free shot from 2}5 metr-e-s.
Sturridge wa+s playing on his ol.d home stadium, an\d t}o honour tha:t, the forward t=hr=e=w a powerful s|hot in th[e upper corner.
Liverpool '?s winning start of the League came to a*n end with the 1-)1 draw, b&ut it stil<l h=olds th;e top position - together with Man<c<h<este<r Cit?y.
Chel)sea i;s also s^ti^ll going fo@r the championship with only t<wo points from the top.
D~iscus~s~ion about clo-c-k switching d=ivi=des the people
I remember so{me decades a*go a newsp)a)per asking several Finnish influential per;son;s what divides Fi>nn>ish pe{op{le.
Onl_y resp>onse I rem/e/mber w"as Juice L[eski[nen ’ s: ‘ Nen ’ ending.
Some surn+ames ha-ve a ‘ ne_n ’ ending, some d*o not.
D;i;viding li<ne<s can spring up anywhere, and this w|as o?n?e o[f the possible reasons.
I.n EU, F&inl&a&n&d h_as a,c,hiev,e,d that this annual clock changing i!s about to b/e/come history.
Many a&gree that switching clocks tw_ice annually h!as been s%imply foolery, an'd that it has caused many pro{blems.
In the e?n?d, t*hi*s ac&hi&e&v&emen&t seems to be the e$asi$est pa>rt of the solution, ev)en though i!t has not been that e<asy.
Th:e most difficult part n+ow is t,o choos&e the ult]i]ma]te time: curre$nt summer or winter time, o@r some o/th/er time zone.
The people can also h|ave th`e`ir s)ay on otakantaa.fi s^ite.
T&he on(li(n(e surve|y has b_een opened by the Ministry of Transport and Communications, and i&t will b`e open until Friday 1.2 Octob,er.
Discussions a<re h!eated both around coffee tables and in social media, an]d everyone has some-t-hi-n-g t;o say about t<he matt+er.
Those f+av+o+u+ring win@ter time ju{s{tify their opinion with the effects o;f morning sunlight to peoples ’ w@ell-bein@g, an(d th]ose defending summer time with the effects of e&v&enin&g light on peo;p;le;s ’ will to s]p]end t%im%e outside an|d t}hat way t%o their well-being.
Both s<ide<s have solid supporters a&nd good argume&nts.
A-c-c-or-d-ing to res!earch, morning light sets the pace for a person ’ s da.y and inc(reases ene{rg{y l^evels.
On t=he o<the<r ha;nd, if a per)s)o)n does n\o\t p"a"rt"icula"rly suffer f`rom waking up when i$t ’ s dark, light increases t,he time peo^ple spend outside and better enables fo<r exampl_e autumn yard work.
Th!e amount o<f extra light hour+s after a normal work day h,as already be:en calculated.
I would rath?er tak~e both, but i>t ’ s unlucky that w?e cannot help our location i{n th{e no/r/ther/n c>o>rne>r of the Earth.
The win$t$er$s are anyw;a;y too dark, t=he su{mm{ers t"o"o light for many people.
It i"s typical for discussions about thi>s matter to support one ’ s o"w"n views an}d oppo,se the o~ther side ve~ry uncompromisingly.
There is no need t#o listen to t`he justifications of t/he o:p:p:o:si:n:g side, si"n"c"e th(e most important thing is how o_ne feels a|bo|u|t t{h{e matter.
Sin`ce almost everyone has an op<i<nion ab[ou[t t~h~is matter, it is somewhat poi;n;tle;s;s t\o t!ry to change someone ’ s mind.
I$t is effort w^ell wasted.
It is easy t"o have an argument ab]ou]t this topi`c, since it does n`ot require to re>a>l>l>y g@o into details, a*nd a}n opinion is justification enou(gh.
These kinds of topic^s are ge[n[e[rally t-ho-se, who incite m(os(t furious, an,d most futile, deb-a-te.
Obviously i"t will be a&nnoying if a wr<ong op]ti]on is chosen, b.ut we will s!ur!e!ly reconcile ourselves with i]t.
A^n^d, should life feel t>o>o g-lum, it always offers a suit&ab&l&e scape+goat.

Eno churc"h celebrates it!s bicentenary on Sun'da'y
E+no church b[i[c[ent[enary i[s celebrated tomorrow on S#unday, for some part in a ver!y sa<d atmosphere.
K<ii<htelys<v<a<a<r<a church arson a w?eek ago wa+s a shock.
Also Eno church w#as guarded on the t~wo nig`hts after the f)i)re.
Despite t,h,e p}ain, t'oday is a day o`f celebration.
Even if noone w]oul]d want it to b@e s.o, Eno church is no.w th,e oldest church in the Joe/n/su/u p<ari<s<h union.
The church on a hill in the centre of t*he v*i*ll*a*ge ha;s always been the h{ear{t of Eno, de:s:pite all sorts o'f munici?pa?l and o)th)e)r me/rgers.

Afte&r t:hat, a K]arelian banquet ta(ble is set at t_h_e church hall.
There i^s a lot of different things happening during t@he day, bo|th i;nside a"nd ou`t.
I\t i!s possible for example t,o visit the church building gui"ded b/y retired sac$rist$a$n of 3!7 years, Ari Räsänen.
Ch.ur.ch b`irth celebration also i?s an end of a]n era.
The church hall, built in 1982 an{d already taken o`ut of use, will k%eep it%s do;or;s ope\n fo~r the last ti*me today.
Currently we h\ave temporary faci*li*t*ies a"t th-e old municipal hall, chaplain Markku Kostinen s;a;ys.
Th<e church hall was de<stro<yed b|y indoor air p!r!ob!lems, but t~h~e church has been healthy in place fo"r already 2:00 years.
Elon Musk steps dow)n a_s chairman of th&e board for T"esl"a - Fr%aud charges settled w!ith $40 million
Electric car manufacturer Tesla an_d the company ’ s CEO Elon Musk h(av(e sett;led their case with the Securities and Exchange Co\mm\i\s\sion SE)C, wh$o reg=ul=ate t{he U.S. secur>i>ti>es indu}stry.
SEC s-uspected Mu`s`k to be guilty o:f a securities fraud, an{d Musk was in dan|g|er t;o be removed from th:e management o*f the company h|e founded.
However, Musk is all_owe_d t]o cont;i;n;ue as Tes!l!a CEO.
Instead, Musk ha$s to step down f<or three years a;s chairman o=f th"e board for T#e#sl#a.
T;he company has t_o hire an o-utside chairman.
Mus+k will a`lso be u)n)der stricter supervision.
According t<o t^he settlement, T~e~s~la will hav<e t/o appoint two i}ndepend}e}n}t directors and oversee Musk ’ s communications in th]e future.
I]n addition, bo;th Tes\l\a a!nd Musk have to pay $20 million (ca . 1-7 million eu.ro) to se#ttl#e the cas.e.
‘ The r|eso|lutio|n is i}nte}nde}d to p[r[e[ve[nt further marke<t disruption and h\arm to Tesla ’ s shareholders ’, s\a\ys SEC c]o-]direct]or Steven P|ei|ki|n.
The case began in Aug=us=t, w?hen Musk twee+te+d that he c+oul+d take T~esla private.
He a#l#so wrote that f<u<ndi<ng has been s~ec~ured.
This tweet cau?s?e?d T@esla ’ s stock pri(ce to rise tempor>ar>i>ly.
S+EC suspe~cte~d Musk guilty of a sec_uritie_s fraud.
Ac-cordin-g to SEC, t&h&e tweet was false a}nd misleading, an;d Musk had not discussed the deal wi>t>h the comp"any ’ s other directors o(r potent:ia:l financing p>artners.
In practice, SE~C char&ged Mu~sk with misleading the in%ves%t%ors.
On Frida/y, SEC announced i{t i(s goi"n"g to sue the company and Mu?s?k.
S@E@C told it is seeking t-o impose f-ines on Musk an!d to ba*n hi!m from be/ing able to h{o{l{d officer or director positions a|t publicly-traded companies.
SEC ’ s summ#ons sc+ared t_he investors, and Tes>l>a's sh!are took a nosedive.

T^he sharp-ey]e]d viewers paid attention to t{h{e studio audience r(e(act(ion(s in The W!all Finland quiz sh=ow.
The American t!ele!visio!n format Th}e W`all ha,s spread quickly worldwide, and its Finnish ve%rsion arrived at channel Ne^lone^n l@ast Saturday.

Bread day vi>sitor n`um`ber con]tinue]d to grow
The mo$t$h$e$r of Bread Day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, marvels at the at~tenda~nce i{n the big ha@ll '(s audi/torium.
Somehow I thought there would p;erhap;s not be that man$y people th#is ye~ar, Hyväri@ne@n thought i.n the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, Bread D"ay was orga/ni/s/ed at th$e same t.im.e wi[th Finnish plowing contest, so ma:ybe the expectation wa's that t.he attendance could even go d~o~w~n f}rom the year b/ef/or/e.
But unlike expectations, the a^i^s^le^s were cr`owded alr(eady bef/or/e t,en, the seller(s said thei(r p=roduc=ts were sold out, new crop porridge was s:ol:d more t<han last y-ear, nearly 50+0 port)ion)s, and Hyvärinen h&eard there had also b\een a rise in the number of cars.
T`h`e atte>n>danc>e estimate has be{en ab\out 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in th~e afternoon.
During the fi*ve hours in th.e morning and after-no-on, t[he programme had especially many thing$s fo)r f,a,m,i,lie,s with children, which p{robab{ly was the r{ea{so{n why there w:a:s a record numbe]r of them present.
Hyvärinen also esti#mate#d the event rea$c$hes people fro\m even fu}r}t}her distances.
Every year, th"e sellers a)lso com+e t{o Liperi from a l&a&r&ger area.
This year, there were nearly a hun@dr@ed sale$s representatives, handi^cr^a^f^t, pastry, a$n$d har$vest product sellers i#n the b\r\ead par~i~s~h.

I^t is worthwhile to invest i"n go(o(d lighting.
We collected three go_od r.easo.n.s t`o investi in lighting.
The ti\ps came from Innolux Direct%or o<f Sales and Marketing Tarja J+okinie+m+i.
D`o a favour to your e<yes
The importance o=f lighting grows together w|ith ag'e.
Sufficient light c=a=n help in t@hose p`rob`l`e`ms ma!n!y peo$ple get when t&he&y age, a]s visual acuity decreases and mo_r_e and more suffer from glares.
As o&n&e gets o/lder, also t$he need for ligh|t grows.
A person i>n their sixties requi}res thre]e tim.e.s the light than a p!e!r!son in their t'w'en'ties.
It is worth^while investing in the therapeutic effec{t{s of light an}d in lam%p qual]iti]es already for health r~eas~ons.
A go)od lamp g<ive<s enough l-ig-ht but does n'`t cause glares, Jokiniemi g{ive{s tips.

T+he ma{ter{ial{s no[w include w"ood, concrete, cer^a^mics, p,aper, leather, and bamboo.
Express your persona&li&t&y
P_e_o_ple in;ve;s;t in their homes mu{c{h mor'e tha-n before, and decor h%a%s became a wa`y to express one ’ s personality.
Instead o@f mass production, pe:o:pl:e want to have a tailored, ev&en a b=ol=d lamp that has a sto<ry t^o te:ll.
People are clear%l%y looking for Finnish and Nordic p@roducts with a well-known o<ri<gin an&d designe+r.

One does not necessarily b,u,y th*e m=os=t re~cent trendy lamp to o^n^e ’ s h*om*e, b~ut rather a timeless cl{assic one has saved m#an#y years for.
C]ert]ain ki:nds of timeless, jewel-li[ke, el'e'gant classics hang on f{rom year to year, Jokiniemi sa-y-s.

Ev!er!est h:a:s its premiere i&n Finnish TV now.
In May 19;96, climbers on Mount Ever/e/s/t w$ere overtaken by a d&isast&rous snows{torm.
Baltasar Kormákur ’ s 2*015 dire$cti$on tells a)bou)t the fight for survival that h!a!s be{en co*ver*ed plenty of times.
There have been prev]ious f)i)l)ms - an@d documents - about th,e tragedy.
The real events are lo/oked throug$h als+o in this a~rticle.
2\2 years ago, the world's h_ig_hest m>o>un>ta>i>n took t<he l\ive\s of eight climbers.
Two o=f th`em were experienced e@xpedi@ti@o@n leaders: Sco`tt Fischer and Rob Ha#ll.
It was prec/ise/ly H%all, w>h>o w>as Weathers ’ guide.
An eye surge_ry performe-d just before his dep,art,ure t[o Nepal mig[h[t have saved W[ea[thers ’ life.
Because of that an@d t#he air pressure, he lost his eye sigh"t, w:h:ic:h meant h;e ha?d to pass t]he climb to th>e summit.
R+o+b Hall continued t`o cli^mb an%d didn ’ t return.
However, Wea(t(h(ers ’ l{if{e-and-{death struggle h(ad on,ly just begun.
As the storm b@le@w u#p, h%e go%t lost a!nd didn ’ t find his w[ay back t`o the camp.
When people ca`m`e to loo]k for the man, th#ey found h^i^m i&n su<ch a bad con~d~i~tion that they didn ’ t b+elieve he w,ould survive.
Weathe/rs was left t_o die.
A}s if by a miracle, h'e still managed t+o find her fe)et a#n#d find th|e others.
Weath*ers was b"adly frostbitten, so they stil;l th;ough he was dyi$n$g, and once again he was left to h$i$s o[wn d+evic+es.
I|t i<s o+bvious that ag%ai%n%st all expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
A{t some po~i~n~t, also his fellow climbers began t*o be/l/iev/e in hi's chances to such a.n ext+ent they helped him.

All offshore tours are can"ce"l"led, and o?n?e shoul%d be careful al~so wh?en walking, so that bra;nches o{r other loose objects flying i%n the storm do not hi<t o@n@e.
During t<he weeke/nd, t}he guid`es distributed these kinds of instructions for the about 3,500 Finns holidaying in Gre$ek vi[a Aurinko!matkat.
The instructions are needed, because acc(ordin(g to the forecast, it is pos_s_ible that the Zorba st"or"m batter"i"ng the Gr\ee\k i<sla<nds thi(s weekend can reach ev(en a hurrica*ne lev=el.

F,or example, the w~ors~t storm will most li#kely reach th+e island o>f Kos on S{unda{y morning.
At t?he s!am!e time, Rhodes even saw a bit o<f sun o,n Satu'r'da'y af[ternoo[n, a+nd the t'em'pe'rat'ur'e rose to 27 degrees, say[s Ikonen from Aurinkomatkat.
It i$s e&stima&t&ed that Zorba w!ill continue to trouble Tur*key next, e#v#e#n though i't will be sl_i_ght_l_y eased off.
T@o prepare for this, we have already contacted ou_r s~ta~ff in Turkey, and for example checked th*e number of Fi^nns w.h.o h,a,v,e flown t-o Antalya wit$h Tui, Schroderus say.s.

Hussi has a r*e*c*ent move be|hind her, since she moved t]o Jätk`ä`saari fr:om K;amppi on Friday.
For the time b(ei(ng I ’ m going t'o sta^y t]h]e]re, w>e ’ ll see wha:t happens.
The essential thing i+s that t-he new flat ha(s a separate st-ud-y, Ho*ssi reflects.
Before t~he move, Hussi holid.a.yed alon@e in Greece.
I~t was lovely, I was at the ho&tel for a w[eek witho/ut going an#ywhere.

I di^d m`y hair and make-up i%n the aeroplane.
Th-is is real gl>amo>ur.
I c<hang<ed i]nt]o my eve)ni)ng dress at h'ome, Karvinen laughs.
Kar%vi%nen says she d(re(w o-ut her makeup kit surr|ounde|d by pensioners.
Her preparations drew the f:e:l:l:ow tr)av)e)le)rs ’ a&ttent&ion.
I had a big mirror a'nd v:ia th`e mirror I could see p\eo\pl\e l{ooking.
My m'ak'e'up was amus?i?n?g at least t*o others.
Karvinen flies t:o Spa'in o.nc.e a week.

Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting supe|rvision together with Metsäha>ll>itu>s a{nd Finnish Wildlife Agency i/n North Kar(el(ia and Savolax on F.r.iday and Satu`rday, the hunting contact persons of the police de@partm@ent sa[id i.n social media o`n Satu@r@day.
The main e\m\phas\is in supervision was the legality and permi[ssi[bi[l[ity o;f hu;nt;ing.
Each hunter '[s gam>e licence an\d hun{ti{ng permit required on state land were c#hecked.
In a.d.di.tion, the hunting gu?n li.c.ences we]re checked, a~s well as cartridge number of automatic weapons us(ed in hunting g'ame bir"d"s.
Accor-d-i-n-g to t[he police, 11|2 hunters w\ere checked during th`e supervision, and on/ly on hunter wi&thou&t a requ=isite hunting permit was found.
The hu`n`te`r was punished with 1;2 uni|t fines for illicit hu>nti>ng.

Mykkänen travels t=o Turkey to observe th&e selection of Sy~rian q'uot'a refugees
Minister of th\e I:nteri:o:r Ka?i Mykkänen (National Co_a_litio_n) will travel t'o Turkey in the next f&ew days to obse[rve the selection of quota refugees coming t^o Fi)nla)nd.
T<his year, it has been decided t`hat Finland w<il<l rec?eive 530 Syrians from Turkis ref<ug<ee cam,ps.
The selection trips are usually done a cou(p(le o%f times per y_e_ar, w-ith re<pr<es<en<tat<ives from t'he F}i}n}n}ish Immigration Service, the Ministry of Employment an{d the E%co%no%my, and t/h/e Police.
Currently t[he deleg_ati_on is already in Tur?ke?y, con(d(uct(ing interviews.
The United N)a)tio)ns ’ Hig:h Commissioner for Refugees UNHCR fir,st selects p%e%ople who are in an especially vu"lnerable situati`on a.s candidates.
I]n practice, this means people w\ho ar_e considered t@o be in a+n ex`cep`ti`onal distress, such as si?n?gl?e parent f~ami~lies, handicapped and sick pe.r.so.ns, women and ch;il;dren.
The=r=e a`r`e more people selected t&o th>e gr)oup a"rrivi"ng in Finland than th=e quota requires, since i&n practice some o.f them will not arrive for different reasons.
Whil$e i$n Turkey, Minister My[kkän[en will also meet Turk=is=h Minister o?f th'e Interior, S]üle]yman Soylu, an^d non-governmental org.ani.s.at.ions operating on the Syrian border.
Minister Mykkänen w!ill b|e accompanied by Per+manent Secretary Il]kka Salmi.
Talks ab+out add`ition`al quota
Finland has been a_dm_ittin_g q'uot'a refugees since t.he 1970s.
In recent years, t[he qu^ota h%as been 750 refugees per ye[ar.
F}o}r a couple of years, the q'uota w;as 1,050 refug_e_es per yea/r, b!u!t since then, t|he Government has not reached an ag*re*eme*nt ab)ou)t an increase.
T{he N[a[tional Coalition Party has supported the q?uota increase, b=u=t th[e last t]im]e, the idea was shut down by the B'l'ue Re#fo#r#m.
Prime M~inist~e~r Juha S+ipil+ä (Centre) recently pr~o~pose~d the quota t?o be incre]ase]d gradually to 1,500-2,000 people p'er ye>ar.
Mykkänen ’ s visit is th]e fi+rst one the M|inis|t|e|r o|f the I,nte,r,ior makes t:o obs,erve the selection o_f quota refugees du-ring this term of government.
Th+e former Ministers of the I[nteri[o[r, Petter.i O[r[po (National Coalition) and Paula Risikko (Nation?al Coal=i=ti=on), tran$sf$e$rre$d t@o their new tasks before t]h]e visits coul"d be arranged.

Really go;i;ng off t@he t}ra}ck n!ow - it ’ s im-po-ss-ibl-e to kn@ow whether to laugh or cry
L@as@t Saturday Karjalainen reported on the l.egisl.ati.ve proposal to amen>d t#h#e A.n.imal Welfare Act.
The article g+i+ves a)n id*ea t>ha>t to sta.r.t wi"t"h, the proposal prohibits all s'u'c'h animals that have not been separately permitted wi:th a ministerial decree to b:e k!ep!t as farmed a~ni~mals, pets, o[r in o&ther way related to bus>iness operations.
So t[o start with, everything else i"s prohibited exc=e=pt the ani`mal`s that are i[n[dividually m{ent{ion{ed in the act.
I$f the proposal ends u.p as an act, this most like;ly means w@e a;r;e a,ban,d,o,ning a c%o%mmo%n principle i_n w/es/t/ern democracies that a>n ac<t separately forbids an action that endangers the safety o\f society or good practices.
N]o]w the proposed provisions es}s}e}nt}ially fo.rbi.d a:ll such activities that the act or decrees d$o n']t separately permit.
The change will result in a situation whe~re noth#ing n=ew can be tried in for examp<le business, and n[o other thin-gs can be done be=for=e a:n approving act h)a)s be]e]n adopted or a decr*ee i]s]s]ued.
T)he government ’ s actions i^n b|il|l dr)afting in general have been w'eak.
I!f we n}ow g/o down th~e r,oa,d that leads to a F(inl(and wh>er>e everyt=hing is forbidden that is no!t separately permitted, I don ’ t kno~w any more whether to laugh or c>ry.
I don't doubt that the Anim=al W"e"l"fa"re A~ct needs a,n update.
But statute d%raft%ing i"n this di|rect|ion i!s not a part of democracy.
Unfortunately I d,on't know the Const`itut`ion a,l,l that well, but I wo+nde+r whether i]t p"er"mits this ki=n=d of ‘ everything is forb"idden if i|t '`s not separately permitted i&n a<n act or a decree ’ procedure.
I w%ish th`er`e would be a sensible minister t]o s&t&op the progr-es-si-on of statute drafting of this ki'nd.
Metti Fors{sell gives a tip: T^he four t(re(n(die(s(t skirts o#f the autumn
The trend garment o\f this autumn co:m:es with a sn!a!k!eski!n patt$er$n.
I,t looks remar+k+ab+ly good especially i!n skirts.
Pair a snakeskin sk~i~rt wi@th a s!ub!dued t<op, like a t|ur|tl|e|neck or a regular t-s|h|i|rt, to keep t;he outfit stylish.
Th?i?s year there is a l/ot of s:i:lk out there, and a silk skirt especially i<s on|e o.f the se[a[son ’ s trendiest ga>rm>ent>s.
Pai}r a gorgeous silk skirt elegantly with a f|em|ini|ne top or c'a's'uall'y w&ith a kni@t.
You can a)l)so be m"o"re playful w)it)h a silk skirt, and put on f-o-r e{xampl{e trainers o>r this autu`mn ’ s trend shoes, c'ow'b'oy bo.ots.
No matter whe^ther its gr:ey, brown o?r multicol'oured, all check s.kir.ts are now pa]rt o-f every woman ’ s must have aut>umn clothes.
Be bold w&he&n combin{i{n{g differe?nt colours a"nd play with the check pattern a?lso by using t.o.ps of different patterns.
For example a combination o%f c%heck and polkadot patt?e?rns i}s beautiful.
A's'ymmet'ri'cal hems are a breath of summer ’ s ligh-tness t!o ta=ke alo<ng to autumn.
Asymmetrical hem i]s at t'h'e same ti>me bo!th feminine and playful, and i$t fits perfectly both during weekdays a@nd i)n a partie*s.

There ’ s no re~as~on for p/an/ic in the Ferrari c^amp, the exp*er*ie*n*ce*d dri<v<e<r estim+ate+d.
The/y ju~st wer]e faster th{a{n us, but it's no:t a huge thing.
So far o/u/r ca)r in the qualifying w=a=s the best thing the whole weekend, but t_hey just were too fas>t, said R;äik;kö;ne;n, wh(o fi/n/is/hed fourth and, toge`th`er w|i|th h/is tea-m mate Se'b'astian Vettel, was clearly slower than Me*rcedes.
Fe<rrari had difficulties a.lre.a.d.y in the previous race i.n Si*nga*pore.
Räikkön,e,n was asked what i.s the cause for the sud+d+en d`rop behind Mer?ced?es.
Th|ey s;eem to go faster than us - that '`s how sim,pl,e it i\s.
If I kne$w the reason f^or tha%t, we ’ d proba%bl%y go a*s fast as they are g$oing.

Räikkönen ’ s future t{ea{m, Sauber, had a r,ar,e treat i:n t)he qua,lif,yi,n,g.
Ch_arles Leclerc, wh!o replaces Räikkönen at Ferrari ne{xt season, was s*ev*e*nth, an"d Marcus Ericsson al)so managed t/o make it t,o the fi.nal qualifying session.
T~he tenth position i's the b!e!s!t one the Swedish drive#r ha?s had in ov]er three years.
And even if there were a#s m/any as five drivers not par(tici(pat(i(ng i+n th/e second s=e=ssion, the end result was still delicious f+or Saub(e(r.
And perhaps encouraging fo$r Rä*i*k*kön*en, considering t`he ne-xt season.
Yes, i-f you compare to where they w@ere i@n t)h)e b_egi_nnin_g of the season, th:e step fo[rw[ar[d has b#een a huge one.
Next y/e/ar there will b'e a different story, s_o w'e ’ l\l se{e, we ’ ll see.
That was it - Robert H,e,l,e,nius k_n_ock_ed o$ut Erkan Teper: ‘ Rob$be i&s back ’
A m_atch between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper progessed i_n a|n even manner i\n th,e Stuttgart n<igh<t.
Th&e Germa"n had more initiative in the ri_ng, but h`e did_n ’ t manage to land g#ood hits.
He`le`nius has a significantly wider reach and c&ontrolled the match with his hard series o.f p$unc$hes that f#o#un#d t:heir way i+n well.
T]he Finn also was obviously i[n a better physical condition th[an Tepe-r.
Th<e resolve fina.l.ly came in t&he ei,ghth r:oun:d, as Helenius k>nocked Teper out with his left cross.
T`he punch was s]o h@ar@d th'e veteran, who w]as fighting in front of a h*ome c{r{owd, didn ’ t even t$ry to get u=p from the mat.
Aft.er victory was confirm@ed, Helenius ’ cel-e-b-ration was quite ca)lm.
I|n the r`ing interview he first complimented the goo_d atmosphere created b;y th*e audience and hi)s opponent.
Then he changed int,o F\innish for a mo@me@n@t.
Thank y%ou for all the s)p)ectators and Finnish su=pporter=s.
We took the belt wit&h u>s to-day.
Helenius rejoiced r{ight a'f'te'r the m~at~ch.
From the per\s\pecti\ve of Heleni`us ’ career, this wa[s a reall$y big w@in.
There mi<g<h<t even be a possibility t'o go to a w.orld champion%shi%p mat)ch, Helenius commented to I$lt$alehti be|f|ore the match.
A defeat, on the o't'he'r ha.nd, mig>ht've end'ed his wh<ole boxing career.
Of course I 'v{e t-h-ought about i_t.
I ’ m not getting a'n'y younger, 34[-y[e[ar-ol[d Hel#enius a+dmi+t+ted before m#eeting Teper.
Number o*f Indonesian disas]ter victims can mu&ltiply
According to The Guar_di_a_n, the vi;c;e president of t{he country war?ns about a c-l-ea-r ris[e in the number o[f victims.
The vice p,r,e,side,n,t of t)he country, Jusuf Kalla, sa@y@s t+h+e death toll ca{n r>each thousands.
Difficult circum>stances
The re|scu|ers look for th=o=s=e trapped in the ruins an&d also fo^r the d&ead in the Su_lawes_i areas that have suffered w}orst: Harbour ci?ty of Palu and its neighbouring c=i=ty o'f Dongga/la.
So f=a=r a{l{l the vi>ctims a(r(e from Palu, there is no certainty of Do)ngga)l)a s*ituat*io*n.
Hundreds of people are miss>ing and abou(t 54?0 are badly i(nju(red.
There are st(i(l(l p@eop@le trapped in the ruins o+f collapsed bu}il}dings, an)d t%he rescuers have not yet bee,n a,ble to get out.
For example, hotel R:o:a Roa i!n P)alu has collapse?d.
T<he rescuers say the|y have hear~d trapped peo"ple crying from the ruins, bu)t a l_a_c_k of heavy cle+aring eq?u?i?p?m?en?t has delayed rescue work.
Ind*o*n*esi*an pres/iden/t Joko W=ido=d=o has ordered the troops to h#elp in re}scue and clearing work.
T+here is a need f#or army and its equ(ipmen(t, because elec#tri#city and co@m@m@unic@atio@n@s links are down in m?any pla"ces in the d`i`sas`te`r area.

Miss Finland finalist ’ s hesitant an~swer an<d long c$ons$iderat$ion c.ause.d roars o%f laughter
New Miss F`i`nla`nd i.s currently being chosen a)t Billnäs Ru,ukki.
E)a)ch beauty fi@nalist was asked a question during the i}n}te}r}vi}ew roun[d.
The finalists drew a questio:n f}r}om a glass bowl o)n a ta%ble.
The hesitant an|sw|er o-f espe{cially fin$al$i$st nu@m@be@r six, 23-year-old Emilia Ant\t\iko\s\ki, brought about a hearty but benevolent laughter i\n the aud.ience.
Question t{hat was posed to A}n}tt}i}k}oski cam`e through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to kn\o\w what i$s the las@t boo&k the finalist h@a@s read.
A=n=t=ti=koski considered her a+nswer fo-r quite a whi`le, before s(h(e hesitantly began:
Thank you f/or your qu<estion, Pir~kko~-~Ella.
The last b=oo=k I ’ ve read i.s .^.., Ant?tikos?k?i said pon(d(e(ring.
Her pause f/or consideration ca)used roars of laughter in t"he audience, unti$l Antt"ikos"ki continued:
Th|e last book I ’ v<e r-ead is ...

Probably some$thi$ng r`el`ate`d to economics.
S"o the last bo/o/k I ’ v&e read is something about eco!no!mic!s, A'ntt'ikoski answered.
After her answer, A/ntt/i/kos/k/i received resounding a*ppl*auds from t%h%e aud)ience, accompan/ie/d by laughter.
Earlier during th^e Miss Finland tour Anttikoski a_t_tra_c_t_ed attention because s+he didn ’ t wa'nt to pose i|n jus|t underwear on a[cc[oun[t of h:er principles.

Sikke's apple an{d p(ea(r cake i?s delectable
T\h\is i\s a recipe for you, who h.a.ve y{ou{r own good, s)o)u)r apples, because Finnish apples are dreadfully e,xpensi,ve i#n the s-hop.
Pears yo|u mig}h}t have to buy, even thou`g`h many mi&g&ht already have a p%ear tree growin,g, too.
It i(s possible to ma|ke this cake just from apple<s, if you d+on't want t^o buy pe!ars.
Obviously t"h"e flavour i&s mo`re diverse, if yo|u a)ls)o invest in a pear.
Peel the apples a)n)d t~he pear, remove t[h[e core-s.
Sli.ce them.
Melt t{he bu<tt<er in a p`a`n.
Be[at the e|ggs and sug=ar into a froth, then add cor(n flour a(nd m`e`lted butter.
C[o[m[b[ine cornstarch, i..e . maizena, an[d baking powder, and a}dd th;o;s;e t`o the batter.
Add alm_ond flour a>nd wheat flour, mi/x well.
Line a b:r:e:ad p~an with baking s"h"e"e"t pap!e!r, sprinkle two tab)l)espoon)s of sugar o\n the bottom o(f the p?an, and spread pe#ar slices on top o=f the sugar.
Spoon h>a>lf of the batter o=n top of pear s_l_ic_e_s and spread th#e a$pple s|lice|s on top of the b*a*tter.
Spoon the rest o}f the batter on top o.f t^he app#le slices.
Bake i,n an oven in 18&0 degrees fo:r about an hour, until th[e sur?f?a?ce is ni*c*el*y brown.
Le}t cool in the pan a<n<d the=n r"emov"e to a platter.
D_o no|t cut the cake unti.l i`t ’ s properly cooled.
The cake structure i`s fragile and easily cr?u?m?bl?ed, be~c~a~us~e t`he batter c[ontains gluten free almond and co:r:n flours.
A\n inte*rn*a*tio*n*a*l crime fiction festival wil;l be organised at Ru/k/a in January
A{n international literature festival f<ocus<s<ing on nordic cri#me ficti(on will b$e organised f'o'r the first time at Ruka, Kuu;s;a;mo in January.
T%he programme for Nordic Noir eve=n=t c]onsists o/f interviews, panel discussions, an{d other literary-themed events as well a+s jazz mu%sic.
T-he guest au"tho"rs of the festival include, for example, the st.ar of Swedis<h detective storie}s, Jens Lapidus, and t!he duo wr*iti*ng under the pen name of Erik A?xel S/u/nd, Jerker E>rik>s>son and H<åk<an Axl>a>n>de>r S>und>qu>is>t.
In addition t\o Sw<e<dish na-me-s, guest authors fro[m Ic!e!la!nd, Norway, and Finland are a{lso seen duri}n}g the festival.

According t{o fe;s;tival organisers, th|e northern l#o#c#ation, the natur-e, the d=ar=kest t{i{m{e o{f the year, and Kuusamo unique environment offer a setting for a u&ni&que literary ex,peri,e,nc,e.
Status symbols do n[ot a!tt!rac!t f-rie-n-d-s - Four f"acts about popularity
W>ha>t makes a person p~op~ular, charismatic o$r admired?
Syd^ne^y University researchers analysed t>he matter, a}n}d outlined two types o>f ‘ co=olness ’ c/o/n/sist/i/ng of slightly different ch\ara\cteristi\cs: gen@erally attractive coolness and its partial counterp%art, dissid#ent coolness.
Accord?ing to researchers, attractively co!ol people h%ad many s|ocial|ly desired cha_ract_eristics: they wer"e extroverted, friendly, conciliatory, a[nd com%pe%tent.
The dissi>d>ent>s, on the other hand, we+re typ,ical,ly d{ist{ant, independent, rebellious, and h<ad an e?dge to t/heir p&er&sonality.
Th"ey craved for experiences an|d cared little f{o{r out&side&rs ’ evaluations.
B*oth ty{p{es had good self-esteem and steady emotional lif@e i\n common.
Tough rol}e i$s not cool in t=he long r`u`n: high status durin@g te~ena~g~e years do#es n>ot necessarily lead to success later in life.
This is rep,orte,d i~n an American st>ud>y published i<n Child Development j!o!urnal in 2014.
Young pe<ople who started dating earl?y, p~a~r~t~ied, gra<vitat<ed t]o]wards go.od.-looki.ng groups, and wanted to be popular, a$s young adults ha)d a bigger r]isk of substa}n}ce use and straying into c'rime.
They man#age#d t*heir r/e/latio/nshi/p/s worse than their once more unnotice;a;ble peers.
Luxury cars, designer bags or wat%c%hes s?i?g?n?i?fying hi&gh status do n}ot make a perso=n co~o~l - or a!t l&e&ast not genuinely attractive company.
In a resear?ch published i=n Social Psychological an_d Pe$rso$nali$ty S!cienc!e in August, most o\f the people were more will!ing t[o befriend a perso?n dressed in a high/-s/tre/et s(hi(rt than in a designer l~abe~l shirt - even though most people chose to wear a des@i@gn@e@r shir}t for the in:trod:u:ctor:y sit~u~ati~on.

A storm is about to hi.t the!re - a weather fo-re-c-ast i@s screaming r@ed
During the w"ee"kend, the r>a>in>fa>l>l i?n s$out$he$rn Gree=ce m[a[y be equal to the average amount of rain i/n Finland during six mont&hs.
Zorba storm wi%ll hit G(re(ece during the w\eeke\n\d.
Be prepared if y@ou are staying i(n t.h.e area of Pel}opo}n}ne}s}u}s, the I)onian Islands, t)he Cyclades o(r Crete.
The storm will be very strong, so th>e Finnish Emb*assy i{n Athens re"p"o"rts about i=t o[n i`ts Facebook page.
According to t'he Embassy, the Hellenic National Meteorological Service has iss_ued a r`ed weather wa\rning t[o these ar{eas.
The oncoming st'o'rm is a%l%s%o told abo]ut i;n wea!t!he!r service Foreca ’ s blog.
According to i/t, th#e s(trong(est winds can be up t$o 45 metres pe=r second.
By way of comparison, the Kuisma st-o-rm that lashed Finland early in th:e we?ek blew a!bout 31 m}etres p`er se"cond a>t its height.
According to t{h{e blo~g, t%he biggest conce+rn of Zorba storm i{s not the wind though, but th/e heavy ra!in.
There can be up t<o 300 mm rai,nfa,ll i.n th-e southern Greece during the wee^k^e^n^d.
T|his is equivalent o^f about a half o?f Fi@nni@s@h annual rainfall.

Appears o'n confusing Y<ouTube videos

Valtteri Bottas was shaking and bursti)n)g with a@dren@ali@ne in S}och}i - wi[l[l he have t%o b)e Hami[lton ’ s aid on Sunday?
Valtte:ri Bottas w!a!s still shaking dozens o-f minutes after hi>s pole po'sit'i'o'n'-wort'hy drive, sta>n>d>ing in front of t^he media.
A great lap lef]t be/hin/d Mer;ced;es number one star, Lewis Hamilton, an'd was n$o dou}bt imp/ortan/t also mentally for the Finnish driver, who h&as gathered his s;ha;r;e of criti)c)ism this se+a+s+on.
A n@ice l{a{p.
I d>on ’ t know wha]t h"a"pp"e"ned t@o L[ewis when he did not finish the dec&is&i&v&e lap.
I:t feels goo?d, I ’ m s{til{l shaking a b~it, B&o&ttas clarified.
I ’ v#e h~ad on.ly o?n?e pole pos|it|ion this y&ear, in Au(st(r(ia (i!n midsummer), s;o quite a bit of time has passed.
This circuit has be`e`n good t+o me i=n t^h^e p#ast, and again I had so#m#e good laps.
It's not easy t@o overtake at Sochi c}i}r}cui}t, s{o the start plays a,n espec(iall(y large r}ole.
And naturally B%ottas had to reply to a questi)on whether h;e's driving for victory tomorrow o;r whe^the^r h#e ha@s to assist Hamilton, who i^s c{l{ose to reaching th}e championship title.
M^y goal to th}e r{a{ce i%s definitely trying to win.
Whe{n yo#u have a pole position a?t the start, i(t re~al~ly is the o;nly goal, Bottas states.
But as a team, w,e fight f'o'r bo`t`h champio"nsh"i"ps.
Lewis ’ lead t,o Seba,stian Vettel is quite bi>g, and the gap bet-ween him and me i%s ve_ry bi#g, so I have to b"ear that in mi\nd.
We ’ l:l see what happens, Bot]tas a?d?ded, th:ough.
Af-t-er th\e qualifying, Hamilton w(as g!en!ui!nel!y hap=py about Bottas ’ success, a[nd also Mercedes team boss Toto Wolff w#as pleased.
Lewis meant t<o win Valtteri, b*ut h]e didn ’ t su/cceed i#n the se;vent;h turn.
Valtteri knows he h@as to give ev(ery(th(in(g h<e has to w@i@n Lewis.
And he w;as so charged that adrenalin_e wa}s bursting f+rom his ea|r|s, Wolff enthused.
W+o+l+f+f was evasive when ans%we%ri%ng a question abou<t whether th)e team will allow B/ot/tas and Hamilton to drive fair?ly.
We're go.i.n.g to h@ave the conversation tom~orro~w morning an>d t,hen see how the race i%s going to p_an out.
Ern=o Kinnunen f|ro|m Kite*e won the Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Rall$y Championship series ha`d a rare en}ding.
Hardly ever have bro"thers ended u/p as Fi!nni!sh c=h=ampions a(t the same time.
Now E~er~ik an/d Henrik Pietarinen from Tu^usul^a ac}hi}ev}ed t#ha#t in the final rally driven i'n Salo-Turku ar@ea, as Eerik w{on the SM (F$RC) 1 a;nd Henrik SM (F#RC) 2 class.
Erno Kinnunen fro@m Kite:e ensured the best a.c.hi.ev.e.men.t of his career, as t*he thir*d place in t@h@e final rally clinched h|is Fi$n$nis$h championship i%n t]he two-wheel drive cars ’ SM (F{RC) 4 c+las+s.
Co"m"p"et"i"n"g with a Honda Civi\c, Kinnunen a}nd navigator Vi-lle Mäk\el\ä began the Tu]r]ku e>v>e>nt with patience, since t=he starting points were clear: a posi;ti;on i|n the leading group would guaran;te;e the title.
In the darkness o)f Fri<day evening, the pai+r had t-o give o!ther!s a handicap, when p[art of their additiona[l headlamps betrayed them in th+e second special stag'e.
We w.ere pretty blind fo(r a third s\tretc\h.
You c;a n,'t fuss around i-n a situation lik<e that.
O-n Saturday we just followed behind J.u.s.s.i Te>ppo, who was second i_n the s_er_ies, Kinn?u?ne?n said.

T=he Syria'n foreign minister demands the United States, France, an^d Turkey to w'i'th'd'raw thei%r troops from Syr'i'a.
Speaking for the U|nited Nations Ge,ner,a,l Assembly on Saturday, Foreign Minis)ter Walid M[u[al[l[em sa>ys the foreign troops must leave Syr!i!a imm$e$diately a<nd w*it*hou*t any stipulations.
Mua!llem said the fo(reign troops are in Sy"ria t~o fight terrorism, and accordi-n-g to h(i(m, t&h&e w+a+r against terror i>s ‘ almost over ’.
In h)is UN address, Mu+all+em also invited Syr}ian r-ef-ugee-s to return to home c]o]un]try.

Not quite Super Bowl, bu+t tens o/f millions of Ame-ric-a-n-s wa{tche{d the Supreme Cour;t Justice drama from th,e television
Judge Brett K*a*vanaugh, nominee f@o@r the Supr*em*e Court, an_d pro%fes%s%or Christ-ine Bla=se=y Ford, who accuses him of sexual assault, gathered exceptionally many people i;n f^ron^t o}f their tel;evision sets.
T,h,e Supreme C|ourt Justice no"min"a"t"ion drama tha>t is a~t full thro(t(tl(e i&n the United States gathe.red at least 2&0 million people in front of their televisions on Thursday.
That is wh"en Kavanaugh, nominated by Do!na!ld T_r_ump, and Californian professor Blasey Ford, who accuses h<im of harassment, appe]a]r]ed i>n f/r/ont of th%e Sen[a[t[e Jud[icia[r[y Committee.
Acc(o(rd(i(ng t,o pre~lim~i~nary res}ults, the s.ix m*ain channels ABC, CBS, CNN, FOX News, MSN<BC, a^n^d NBC had a total o:f 20.4 million viewers during t:he hearing broadca;s;t.
In addition, t#her#e were se]ve]ral million fol"lo"wing the h=e=ari=ng online.
According to NBC, 6.&8 mi-lli-on p|eople followed their l>ive str$e$am, and C~N~N reported its record of t&h&e y'e'a'r with 8.2 million live broadca;st launches.
C@N@N num'be'r rises t`o over 1,0 million, wh;en people following the broadcas%t via YouTube and Facebook are counted i]n.
Also Fo[x News Dig`i`ta`l reached 8.*0 million launches.
Dig'it'al launches ar}e reported by t*he channels the)m)selv)es, TV view\er numbers co=me f!r!om research and data analysis company Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes the f)i)nal numbers on Mo.nd.ay, but t)h)ey a're anyway going t@o b;e huge.
20 million viewer^s reached b&y few
Normally viewer ratings o'f over 20 million are reached only b,y s<por<ts matches, big Os&car and Emm[y galas o;f the ente#rtai#nme#nt wo+rld, and occasional politi@ca@l events such a.s presidential speeches, an|d, in 2016, als^o presidential el~e~ction debates.
The an,nu,al most vi]ew]ed sho^w o!f th?e United States, NF-L final match Super Bowl is st&il&l far away, though.
This year, Super B~owl on NB(C cha>n>ne>l g-athered about 103 mi:l:lio:n people in front of their scree[ns.
Acco/rding to Niels!en, l)as)t year T\rump's f&irst speech to the Congress w-as wat!ched by a total of nearly 48 mil:lio:n people, and his inau?gur?ati?on by more than 3[0 million p_e_opl_e.
Matter of t@op importanc)e
A}p}poin}tment as a justic;e t\o the Supreme Cou@rt is an extremely significant occasion, sin*c*e it i<s a lifetime ten>ur>e.
Trump a]lr]ead]y got to appoin-t o*n*e ne/w justice, when Antonin Sc:alia pass'ed a!way i.n early 2016, and the Republicans managed to stop the then president Barack Obama fr!om a/pp/oint/in/g his f$oll$ower.
Another p?lace became ope&n when j&udge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announced t)his ye^a^r he i>s going to retire.
Ke?nne?dy was appo"inte"d by the Republican President Ronald Reagan, b_u_t in many questions he wa^s the so-c$al$l$ed s^w^in^g vo,te, who could decide the po*sition o$f the court o|f nine.
He supported abortion r-i-ghts and rights of the sexual minorities, and his vot$e was decisive i[n 2015, when g\ay c&o&uples nation(wi(de rece{ived a r"ight t=o marry.
Kavanaugh is co`ns`ide`ra`bl`y more conservative i*n h&i&s views.
His appo=i=n=t=ment to the Supreme Court m#ay secure t~he Conservative dominance f{o{r decad$e$s.
Children have a ri:ght to let their parents s"ee t$h$eir infor%mati%on
Only t-he parents of children under 10 ye]a]rs see their children '*s he;alth information in t|he Kanta se<r<v<ice.
It i-s a bi.g problem, it i^s wrong, and i=t is od<d.
Origin}al}l}y the si^t^uat^i^on in the Kanta se#rvic#e was even more worrying: t~he p/a/rent/s could not s-e-e the babies ’ med!i!ca!l records or pr+e+s+cri+ption+s.
In a-utu-mn 201{6, t;he s#ituation wa}s fixed for under the 10-year-olds with an amendment des_cr_ibe_d as temporary
After t(hat, t-h-e-re ha/ve been promises t;o fix t&h&e practices, bu(t the fixing has taken astonishingly long.
Now a fix is on th=e w]a]y - i!n 2]0]20.
Since t`he problem is a<n e=xplicit one, c+hangi+ng the law ba[s[is should not hav,e been anything more than an op$e$n-and-shut case.
Af"ter that, a_ccordi_ng t%o a layperso<n ’ s understanding, it is simply about pressing a button: no[w t_he wi%r%e is clo"sed, s(o let '!s open it.
Nat"u"rally a child can show t@heir information to t'he parents - i`f the child has ban$ki$ng u}ser identifiers or a<n official identity ca`rd.
Bu!t how m&any 1^0^-^y^e^a^r^-old^s have those?
A$n identity c#a#rd is no>t free, and a 10-year-old ca*n ’ t e[ve[n get banking ident_i_f_ier_s.

Humanitarian org-ani-sa-ti-on-s prepare to begin w(ork at Indonesia's Sulawesi - ‘ Cle#an water is t;he most u+r+gent th/i/n/g ’
United Na^t^ion^s Children ’ s Fund UNICEF an$d other int{ernat{ion{al humanitarian organisations are prepare$d t?o help at In=do=nesia=n i*sland of Sulawesi, r,e,co,u,n,t,s Kirs|i Haru, Chief of Comm{u{nication at UNICEF Finland.
The local authorities are in charge o(f t*h*e re|s|c|u|e ope[rat[io[ns, but t(he need for ex)t)ra h~elp is apparent already i+n this stage.
UNICEF operates in nearly ev`ery cou_ntr_y, and w!e h"a"ve long-term pr%o%jec%ts also in Indonesia.
UNICEF always h-a-s a complete emergency he~l~p preparedness, in additio:n t*o its normal operat%i%ons, Har!u says.
The fi=rs=t task now is t>o find the pe'op'le from the ru:i:ns, both the liv"ing an@d the dead.
I<n the Su-l-awe-si city of Pa"lu, the rescue operations ar"e ongoin, but a b^it no/rther in the ar\e\a o,f Donggala, t'he situation is less clear.
Th!ere are still places, where commun-ica-tions d(o not wor@k.
R#e#l#ief actions are d?if?f?i?cult, because also the road+s ar+e blocked, H}aru states.
Bu?ildings o\n Sulawesi are o>ften l{i{g{htw{eig{ht, s&o the destruction caused by t|he earthquake and tsunami are great.
When the survivo(rs ha)ve been fo'u'nd, they need s(h(e(lt(er - in the beginning for exampl~e tents - an,d clean wate~r.
I$n crisis situations, clean wat\er i`s the most urge-nt thing.
First th`in`g w;e c[an generally offer to people are water pur|i|fic|ati|o|n tablets that also UNIC^E^F has i#n stock.
The goal is to repa`i`r the wat"er systems as soon as possible, b|ut in e?me?rg?e?n?cy s"itua"t"io"ns, wa+t+e+r i+s tra^n^sported with for example trucks.
I{n crisi_s situations, many children are separated from th+eir pa%ren%ts.
F`indin`g the family me/mbe/rs and reu*niting families is o[n[e part of the Unicef duti%e%s.
Fo#od assistance i|s organised by, among ot^he^r^s, WFP (World Food P(rogr(amme), which w,or,k,s as a b\ra\nch o}f U\N.
I]n the first stage, pr#evious#ly raised funds ar<e use]d for emergency h+el+p.
Unicef, among others, has however alrea<dy be]gan t&o ra$ise funds to help the vict!i!ms of the ea(rt(h q^uake and tsunami in I$ndone$sia.
Billionaire Elon Musk t{o quit a_s Tesla Chairman of the Boar-d - 2{0 million dollar f^ine for his t`w`eets
E*lo*n Musk, founder o}f companies ma\n\ufa\ctu\ring s]pace rockets a[n[d e)lectri)c cars, a}void}s fraud cha[rges with a deal with the United States ’ Se<c<u<rit<i<es and Exchange Commission.
B,il,lionai,r,e Elon Mus=k quits a|s electric car co^mp^an^y Tesla '"s Chairman o@f t^he Board and agrees to a 20 million dollar fine.
M"u"sk steps down a-s par)t o!f a deal he ma^de with the authority regulat+i+ng the United States ’ securities in?dustr?y.
Wi`th this deal Mus?k a_vo_id_s fraud charges.
The United States ’ Sec[u[r[ities and Excha$nge Commission SEC th]reate]n]e]d musk w;ith a security frau_d because o<f the twe.et.s he sent in A+ug+u+st.
In these tweets, Musk wrote he is pr$e$pa$r$ing to take electri}c c[ar company Tesla pri^v^ate, which r{esulted in a q?u?i?ck r$ise i.n the company's sh}ar}e price.
According t$o the deal, Musk is n]o]t allowed to a,ct as Te-s-la chairman o}f t)he board f-or three years.
In addition, Te@sl@a must nomin+a+te a new “ in+depe+nden+t member ” t@o its b>oa>r>d an=d ta'ke two “ independe,n,t managers ” t#o its management group.
T-esla a{lso ha+s t~o found a committee to supervise Mu)s)k ’ s communications.
Musk i=s allowed to conti"nue as Tesla CE-O.
On t_o_p of M\usk's personal 20 million dollar f.ine, T;esla a+s a com'pa'n'y also has t~o pay an equivalent 2)0 million fin%e to the Commission.
Tweets m=i=sl=ed investors
According t/o SE*C, Musk's twee]ts misled investors and Tesla shareho)lders.
Mus'k claimed t(o have secured fun^ding to re"pur"cha"se T'e'sl'a from the stock mar.k.et to a private company.
According t'o the billionaire's tweets, the co~mpany w|ould hav>e b}een b'o'ug'h't o+ut from the stock market with a stock price of 420 dollar]s.
A/fte/r t[he t_w_eets, Tesla ’ s stock pric)e rose over ten per cent in t.we.n.ty.-fou.r hours, b{ut l-ate-r fell.
Ac&cording to SEC, Tes,la '.s claims ha<d no basis of any ki[nd.
A&c&co&rdin&g to the Commission, i_n reality h%e ha&d n[ot negotiated the funding he claimed to hav?e.
Neither h[ad h(e discussed w?ithdrawing the company from the market with othe&r members of t;h;e managing group o(r the company b^oa^rd.
Fri!day th?is w`ee`k, the price decreased 14 per cent, as SEC pu#bl#i#s#hed th@e fraud charg`e.
The ne|ws about settlement ar,e expected to a?ga?in r!e-enforc!e t=he company's stock price.

N;at;u;rally the Cathedral's be|l|l|s won't r.i.n.g when the ha\n\ds a{r{e not moving.
It '#s a t)e)chnical malfunction.
T{he clock in Helsinki Cathedral tow|e|r ha`s stopped.
Th&e hands poi=nt at twelve o ’ cl#ock.
Th{e situation is like from a mediocre hor]r]or film: if on`l`y there was in"canta"tion coming from t_h_e c<ry<pt a]nd t%h%e or.ga.n would play by themself.
This is na}t}ur}all}y n`o`t th}e case, because the clock h^as sto)pp)ed because of a technical m)alf)unction: it ’ s broke|n.
A rep/ai/rer has chec.ked it, b:u:t there is a part broken a`nd w(e are waiting to g)e)t a new part, s-acris-t-an E`velii`na Ja!m!s!en says.
A*t the sam}e time Jamsen confirms the fact alre,ady ment>ion>ed by Kir|k|ko Helsingissä Twitter account.
That is t>o say, th%e re=ason fo:r the clock stopping is not the Last Jud#ge#m#ent, t(he account me;n;tions.
Jamsen says t@he church bells do n:'t r.ing because of a ma~lfuncti~o~n.
