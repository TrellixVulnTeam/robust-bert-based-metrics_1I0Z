Custodians of ethics: The Board o#f the Liberal Movement is right abou(t the action of the Vilnius branch
“ Decisions taken by the Board are in lin!e with the Articles of Association, ” Vytautas Tamošiūnas, the hea@d of the Commission, said to BNS after th;e Co;mm;ission meeting.
“ That decision of ours w@as not something new.
We, as th@e Commission, gave our explanation already in July, when the issue abou`t Pagėgiai an>d Utena had come up.
We said the(n t=hat according to the Articles of Association, this issue is within th~e competence of the Board.
And if t%he Board decides that a particular branch can be>hav>e as it wishes - to ru_n with a committee, and the Bo@ard approves of that, then that branch c'an run so, but if t|he Board decides tha@t the party will run everywhere with party lists, which is what the Board has decided, then it is a decision for all branches to form par<ty lists.
And if someone does not agree with t(he Boar~d, then there is a possibility to s=uspen=d membership and run with a committee," he added.
According to V. Tam'ošiūnas, now the Board of the p@arty is to decide on its further course of ac"tion.
On 17 October, the Board of the polit|ical party Liberal Movement ca#ncelled the decision of the Viln(ius city branch to participate in the municipal elections not wi;th a party li^s^t, but with a list of an elections committee, which is currently being formed.
In the opinion of the Board of the party, the decision of t<he liberals in the cap*it*al city to participate in the ele\ctions in the form of a public elections committee i~s in breach of th>e Articles of Association of the party, decisions of the Board.
Th|e Vilnius branch was to waive its in|tention|s t-o participate in the municipal elections with a committee list by 31 October.
However, the branch fa]iled to do that.
Aušrinė Armonaitė, forme^r head of the branch, a m!ember of the Seimas, has already left the Liberal M"ovement.
The Mayor of Vilnius, Remigijus Šimaš@iu@s, former chairman of the Liberal M}ovement, who intends to run for the second term as th#e Mayor of Vi]lnius, ha,s already introduced the team and i@deas of the public elections committee “ For Vilnius we are proud of! ”.
He also h'as left the party.
Elections for municipal councils and offices of mayor&s will b&e held in March next year.
Residents of a North Indian village used a tractor to crush a tigress, who h{a{d to-rn up a man, th"e officers reported on Monday.
Forest officer Mahavir Kaujlagi said villagers circled the female tiger after it killed a man working i_n the fields la-te Sunday, and when the tiger tried to escape, t+he villager}s crushed it under th_e wheels of a tractor.
Villagers s]aid t/he tiger had injured another young man in an attack about 10 days ago.
The village is inside the Dudhwa Tiger Reserve in Lakhimpur Khiri area, approximately 2:50 kilometers southeast of Lucknow, t-he s;t;ate capital of Uttar Pradesh.
Killing a tig]er in protected areas is illegal.
Th<e reserve ’ s director Ramesh Pand+e+y said that the case in question would be reported to the police u'nder the Wildlife Protection Act.
In April, village:r:s had beate@n up another tiger in Nighasan area of the state of Uttar Pradesh; i-t suffered severe injuries.
The tiger is India's national animal; it i-s categorized as endangered species under the Wildlife Prote|ction Act.
Last year ’ s government data show that, i`n t'he last three years, at least one person wa|s killed per day i_n confrontations with wild tigers or elephants.
The hu/man conflicts with tigers has gradually increased since th>e 8th decade, when India started a tiger conservation program tha!t c*arv*ed out sanctuaries in national parks, and made it a crime to kill a big cat.
Though methods for co{untin{g tigers have changed, a census suggests the population of a%b%out 1,800 tigers t_h_en grew to 2,226 in 2014.
I~t is proposed to mark cat"s and dogs with microchips mandatorily
Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Protection, and other members of the Seimas registered dr{aft amendments to the Law on the Welfare and Pr_otecti_on o}f A~n~imals, proposing t[o mark cats and dogs with subcutaneous microchips under the mandatory procedure.
“ W;e p.ropose that cat,s and dogs would have to be marked with subcutaneous microchips, and their registration and marking wo_uld be organized by local municipalities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2019 marking of all dogs, in 2020 also of all cats would be funded by the state, therefore, people would not have problems and the costs would be covered fr&om special state financial assignments, ” said Kęstutis M?ažei?ka, the Chai^rman of t"he Seimas Committee o`n Environm.ental Protection.
The amendments to the Law ar(e aimed at dealing with the need of syste$mic marking of pets.
It is expected that it will help to av!oid problems c<aused b{y irresponsible pet owners, illegal breeders or sellers.
It is preliminarily a-ssessed that based o[n the average price of the chip and the ch@ip implantation service, which will be about EUR 5, all pet owners will be compensated during the tra%nsitio%nal period.
T<he total price o?f marking all pets can amount up to EUR 6 million.
I!t is planned that the use of the funds will s:pan over the period of three years and will amount to EUR 2 million pe;r year.
It is expected that t)he funds for the marking programs will be assigned through the Special Program of the Munic"i"pal"ities for Supporting Environmental Protection, t?he income of which will gro<w signifi&cantly this year due to increase in taxes on natural resources and redistribution of funds.
Municipalities will be able to use these f)u)n)ds not only for marking of cats a{nd dogs, but also for castration and oth{er programs.
According to K. Mažeika, the mandatory marking is practiced in almost al:l Member States of the European Union, that also allows protectin|g pets (as lost pets can be easily returned to their owners), and saves pet own!e!rs ’ time a%s t~hey usua!l!ly need much time and money in search fo~r a runaway and lost pet.
Besides, the EU legal acts s^a^y that one can travel only with marked pe)ts.
Marking also obligates the owner t)o t>ake care of the pet responsibly throughout its life.
Previous proposal<s to impose mandatory marking we`re objected to, as it was proposed to finance relev_a_nt programs with people ’ s money.
“ The current model should be spar,e,d this criticism, as it is proposed to finance pet protection with increas_e_d income in the program for supporting environmental protection and to give the right t[o do the marking n!ot o<nly to veterinarians but also t"o public activists, i.e . persons in animal shelters who hav"e taken special courses in the Veterinary Academy," t/he authors of the draft say.
The draft law has been registered by a group of members o"f the Seimas representing various factions i/n the Seim#a#s: Kęstutis Mažeika, Algimantas Du*mbrava, Eugen~ijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rimas Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

The match is organized in Vilni.us for political reasons.
Vilnius Rytas, which has warm relationship with Ukrainian basketball, will host Cherkaski Mavpy (from Cherkasy) and KB Prish~tina (from Pristina) teams in R%ytas ar;ena on 7 N(ov(ember.

“ We have a lot o:f friends in Vilnius, our countries have always bee`n on good terms.
Lithuania is one o#f the countries with the best baske+tb+al+l traditions in the world, therefore, it will be an honor for u=s to play here.

Actress B. Arsobaitė starring in “ Women are better li;ars ” is being persecu;ted by liars
I$t is m:ost probably on|ly a coincidence, but the glamorous brown-eyed actress Brigita Arsobaitė keeps getting roles related to liars.
At first it was T"V series "Wome,n are better liars", then the play “ Women liars ” and, finally, the comedy mov"ie “ Li@ars ”.
In this movie, Brigit'a plays a petulant wife of the character pl|ayed by Dainius Kazlauskas.
"I rea'lly liked playing in the movie “ Li<ars ”, but I am a theater actress more a:nd rarely appear in movies.
A wonderful team of colleagues promis?ed a gre(at result from the very outset.
This experience is very important and valuable fo(r me.
But t|he most interesting thi)ng that happened on the shooting set was the puppy Sunny!
All my life I believed tha^t i?f I had a dog, it would really be big and solemn.
I have never had a crush on thos`e little, ornamental doggies o~f silly blondes.
But during shooting Sunny go;t s?o attached to me that the sympathy has become mutual and finally I even wa>nted to buy it from its owner, but unsuccessfully, ” the actor smil(ed.
The ne+w Lithuanian comedy “ Liars ” produced by Paulius Virbickas, the producer of the Lithuanian movie h|its “ Inexperienced ” an\d “ Speaking among us, boys...”, an%d by producers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimiras Razarionovas, gets the view:ers involved into comic and intriguing family peripeteias already from t~he first minutes of the movie.
Y@ou@r beloved has jus_t informed you that she is pregnant.
It wo#uld b(e a wonderful news, but...your beloved is your brother ’ s wife!
B_ut that is not everything.
B?ef?or?e announcing “ the goods ne.ws ” to everybody, the parents sudden#ly declare that they are having a divorce!
After 50 years together ..&.
And all this happe`ns right before the greatest holiday of the ye+a+r - Christmas!
But the ending will su!rp!rise you even more as it was totally unexpe}ct}ed.
All the characters are not such as they looked at fi#rst sigh-t ...

Decision on whether to write off EUR 100 million o:f overdue emigrants ’ t^axe^s is to be taken
On Tuesday, the Seimas accepted an amendme<nt to the Law o(n Declara]t]ion of the Place of Residence proposed by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader o,f the “ farmers ” party, for consideration.
56 members of the Seimas voted in favor o|f it, 9 - against, and 25 absta/ined.
The Seimas will continue c;o;nsider;ati;on of the amend~ments on 6 December or later, after it gets an opinion from the Governm'ent.
R. Karbauskis says that these payments accrue for people who di\d not declare their de"p"a"rture from Lithuania.
According to the me^mber of the Seimas, one person fail~s t,o pay about EUR 1,000 of taxes in a period of three years, and currently the n~umber of such persons is about 100,000.
A social-democrat Algirdas Sysas feared that in this w~ay the Sei/m/as “ will encourage some people to defy their duties ” b]y declaring d\e\parture and then no taxes would be charged.
A conservative Antanas Matulas, member o_f the Com!mittee of Health Affairs, noted that Lithuanians, who live abroad, abuse the situation a~s, paying a small he(alth insurance tax, they come to Lithuania for medica<l treatment and receive the same services as t|he residents who pay this tax.
The amendments p;rovide that those persons, who pay social insurance contributions in the Memb`er States of the European Union, the E'urop'e'a'n Economic Area or in the Swiss Confederation, and are released by Sodra from the duty to pa&y health insurance contributions in Lithuania, would be considered a@s having dep{arte{d from Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the he+a+d o?f Sodra, noted previously that such a ste_p will make both the life of emigrants and the operations of Sodra easier.
A video of a slipping baby bear, that h/as beco/me viral online, reveals a serious problem
It has been filmed how a mother bear climbs a ste@ep snow-covered slope, wh`il`e her cub keeps climbing, s|lidi|ng down and again persistently climbing.
The video had many reviews and co[mments.
People admired the little bear ’ s persistency - having slipped multiple times, i|t use%d to resume its journey towards i=ts mother.
It does not succeed a]t first, but the cub does not even try t.o gi<ve up and finally reaches its goal.
The video really captures atte%ntion b~ut it also reveals the danger people cause for animals.
Scientists say that on%e has also to speak that people ’ s w\ish t>o get to know wildlife sometimes can be harmful.
“ It is obvious t;o me that the drone scared th}e bears greatly.
Their movem)ents show that they panic.
I?f there had been no drone flying around, they would have probabl^y chosen a safer way or would have taken it slower or with more cau_tion.
It is a perfect example of how drones should not be used, ” the ecol^o^gist Mark Ditmer said to the publication “ Th^e V+er+ge ”.
Some time ago, M. Ditme?r and h|is colleagues researched how drones were affecting bears.
Heart monitors were placed on th`e animals.
Wh]en a drone used to come close, some bears started ru%nning, while others did not, but the hearts of all of them were pounding with fe^ar.
Scientists advise t_o use drones for f:ilming animals in a responsible manner, not to fly t^oo close, not to cause noise a+nd not to fly where that is forbidden.
Addressing the runaway President i?n a newspaper
On Tuesday, Kiev court invited the overturned President Viktor Yanukovych, who fle_d to Russia, to arrive to a h\earing of the case, where he is suspected of high treason, in an u`nusual manner - the summons w*e*re published in the of;ficia;l publication of t^he state.
The court summons, published in the government news gazette Uriadovy Kurier, call\s the former leader to arrive to a heari-ng in the criminal proceedings on 19 Nove<mber, during whi(ch his final arguments could be heard.
The document indicates that V. Yanukovych has the righ!t to take part i'n the hearing by way of a v|id|eo conference.
On 30 October, the Kiev court announced having fin%ished debates in V. Yanukovych ’ s ca=se.
V. Yanukovych ’ s advocate Al`eksan`dr Goroshinskiy, working in Russi*a, was given an opportunity to register in the register of foreign advocates by 19 November in order t(o be able to participate in the hearing wher+e V. Yanukovy`ch, as it is expected, would say his final word by use of video conferenc^e.
V-. Yanukovych, supported by the Kremlin, was overturned and fled t!o R.u.ssia during t,he Maidan insurrection in February 2014, whi+c+h had been provoked by the President ’ s refusal to sign the Association Agreement with the European Union.
The Russian President Vladimir Putin later revealed that t$he for`mer lea=der of Ukraine was taken to Russia during a special operation organized by Moscow.
In March that year, Russia annexed the Crim_ean pe]nin]s]ula that belonged to Ukraine, and some time later a war star~ted in the East of the country between K+iev and separatists supported by Russia.
Since then, the battles took lives of about 10,000 people in spite of multiple at{tempts of the international community t,o ensure l#ong-t#erm truce.

Dainius Kreivys, former Minister of Ec=onomy, a member of the Se(imas, has already previously been ap@proved as the candidate of the conservatives for the o:ffice of the Mayor.

Restrictions o$n cogeneration power plants appealed before the Constitutional Court
The Seimas opposition, as promised, appealed against the decision of the ruli[ng p\artie\s to pass the law on a possibility to stop construct_ion of waste-to-energy plants before the C;on;stitutional Court (CC).
On T.ue.s.day, the Seimas opposition faction of t;he Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats (TS-LKD) notified that a group of members of t)he Seimas add+resse+d the CC with an application for investigating whether the amendments to the Law on Waste Management adopted by the rul`ing parties are in line wit=h the Constitution.
“ The members of the Seimas emphasize that provisions of the law aim to challenge the currently ongoing projects of waste incin{eration facilities, instructing the Government to impose new restrictions (20 km dis?ta?nce t#o a residential territory) on waste-to-energy p'lan'ts that started to be co&n&structed in Vilnius and Kaunas befor=e the effective date of the law, ” the no't'ific'ation says.
It adds that “ the members of the Seima~s note that taking into account how the law wo/rds th'e prohibition to construct waste ma"nagement objects of national importance (i.e . determines a distance and defines the concept of “ residential territory ”), a conclusion is t)o be made that this prohibition dis#prop#or#tion#atel#y restricts or ev=en denies t?he very es!sence of the ri;g;ht to perform economic activities related to burning of waste to produce energy, as the established criteria are worded so that, having in mind the population density and distribution in Lithuania, construction of such obje:cts would be practically imposs>ible in the whole territory of the country ”.
The application say]s that th*e adopted law is contrary to the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
“ The CC ha_s indicated for a number o&f times t`hat legal acts do not apply to those legal facts and consequences that occurred before the effective date of a ne)wly adopted legal act.
In this case, th,e G-overnment is given powers to apply the law retroactively, following an indefinite criterion.
Imposing such legal regulation viol+ates the constitution principles of legal certainty, legal safety, protection of legitimate expectations, consequently, th_e constitutional principle o^f the rule of law, ” t,he application indicates.
It also notes that big financial investments have a!l!ready been made to the projects of Vilnius a]nd Kaunas cogene-ration power plants.
Stopping of the currently ongoing projects would inflict a financial loss of hundreds of millions on the Sta>te, the Lithuanian population would suffer huge losses, too - heatin%g prices would increase, t@he growing vo{l{umes of waste in dumpsites would result i\n increased environmental pollution.
The app%lication to the CC has been s_i_gned by members from Seimas TS-LKD, Liber<al Movement, S/o/cia/l Democratic factions and by Algirdas Butkevičius, deputy head of a ruling Social Democratic Labor faction.
A couple of weeks ago, the Seimas gave 71 votes, mostly from the ruling parties, in order to reject the veto of the President Dalia Grybauskaitė on the adopted amendments to t&he Law on W"aste Management, prov)iding for the right of the Government to stop alre-ady started constructio_n of cogene`ration power plants, al$s$o set a b,uf,fer zone of 20 km from residential locations for construction of such power plants.
The amendments to the law repe~at~ed adopted by the Seimas will come int{o force o"n 1 January 2019 . By the way, the ruling par-ti-es already propose to drop the 20 km restriction.
It i"s planned to consider this proposal already in the aut&umn session of the Seimas.
But the Seimas does not plan to cancel the ri"ght of the Government t>o stop already started projects.
The CC will examine the case i-n the order of sequence, which i)s a year l|ater at the earliest.
LeBron James ’ s`ta`ts in Lakers club, w*hich raises concerns, revealed
The start of LeBron James ’ career in Los Ang.ele.s Lakers club is not as expected by him himsel!f, the team and bask~etball fans.
Lak$ers started the season with four wins and six losses, an|d such a weak start resulted in ru`mors that the coach Luke Walton can be fired.
Still, suc?h talks were silenced b)y Magic Johnson, the President of Basketball Operations, who decl=ar=e=d the coach would not be fired, but better play i?s expected.
The biggest star of the team L%. James s[houl[d have a look at himself, too.
T]he p:layer ’ s stats is i;mpressive as usual, though - 26.8 points, 7.6 rebounds and 7.7 assists.
But that is not the whol]e truth.
Du]ring the first ten matches of the season, oth$er figures cam%e up, showing that Lakers play better when L. James is not on the court.
+/- stats, showing the difference in points scored or miss<ed by the team when certain players are on the cour,t, is not favorable for the playe|r.
When L. James w.as on the ground this season, Lakers missed 30 points more tha<n their opponents.
Meanwhile, when he w#as on the bench, Lakers scored 19 points m\ore than their opponents.
Currently, Lakers have just the 13th standing in the Western Conference, but several wins c}an cha,nge everything.

“ Lithuan{ia ve&ry much appreciates t=he Span ’ s cooperation within the NATO framework and its significant contribution in ensuring security of our country and the region, ” said t^he Minister L. Linkevičius.
Spanish military air forces have been performing NATO air police and a$ir p&olice s%upport missions in the Baltic States for already five times, three of t~h~em - in Lithuania.

V. Ačienė about detention of R. Ačas: I belie^v^e my husband i's innocent and I believe in law enforcement
"That was t=he most unexpected thing to me tha[t I could never think of.
On th(e oth`e`r hand, the authorities probably are just doing their job.
Each of u[s are doing our job.
I believe in law en%forcement authorities, I believe my husband, that everythin<g is ju|s|t and fair, that he has not taken any unfair actions, ” V_. Ačienė told BNS.
R. Ačas was detained by the Special Investigation Service (SIS) on Monday - the la<w enforcement authorities suspect that he, while being the Director of the Administration o-f the Raseiniai Municipality, took a bribe of big value, and in exc\hange he cou<ld have created exception;al conditions for a private company that signed a contract wit&h the Raseiniai bu@s fleet controlled by the municipality.
It is suspected that representatives of private companies directly paid off R. Ačas or we^re involved in disgu%ising brib_es as various financial operations.
In April this year, the Council of the Ra;seiniai District Municipality dismissed R. Ačas from the office of the head of the A=dministration at t<he third attempt after a statement o.f distrust in him had been made.
In March this year, a former member of the Order and Justice became a member of t^he n{e{wly founded Social Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania headed by Gediminas Kirkilas, h.e suspended his membership in this political part(y on Monda\y.
R. Ačas unsuccessfully ran for the office o(f the mayor a^s a representative o@f the electoral committee “ Tavo Raseiniai ” several years ago.
V. Ačienė says th}at he[r husband was not going to run fo[r the Raseiniai mayor next year, but he has no}t decided yet on participation in the elections for the municipal councils.
V. Ačienė was elected t[o the Seimas o"n the list of the Lithuanian Farmers and Gre$ens Union, she is a member of the Seimas Anticorruption Commission.
The politician said she would wait for further actions o,f the l|aw enforcement authorities - her decisio|n on removing herself f,rom the work in the Commission would depend on them.
`)` I am really no<t taking any fast decisions today, I will ma'ke up my mind this week, I think.
I will see, i_f it becomes necessary, depending on the type o$f accusations, it is clear that I will have to ta&ke some decision.
It is probably necessary th"at I would stay away from a+ll those matters investigated in the Anticorruption Commission, but aga!i!n - tim|e will reveal the truth, ” she spoke.
Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, a representative of t'he conservatives in opposition in the Seimas, urged the Speaker o[f the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis and the leade!r o#f the “ farmers ’ ” party Ramūnas Karbauskis to dissociate from statements of the faction colleague Vida Ačienė and to remove her from the Seimas Anticorruption Commission, tr%ansferring her t|o another Seim:as committee or commission.
She says that further work of V. Ačienė in th.e Seimas An&tico&r&ruption Commiss{i{on "would cause grounded lack of trust in the society and would discredit the work o+f the important parliamentary supervisory commission".

Grybauskaitė urges China t]o cre{ate a more favorable investment environment for the EU business
The President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites China to create a m{ore favorab*le investment environment for the European Union (EU) investments, to ease conditions for foreign impo>r>t.
In the Chinese import exhibition in Shanghai, while opening th=e trade and investment f_orum, D. Grybauskaitė accentuated that witnessing signs of slowdown i.n economy, the common goal of Europe and China should b%e “ to unite efforts to stop spreading of protectionism in t|he world ”, aiming at essential re*asons o]f the tension caused by trade wars, “ overproduction and unfair competition ”.
“ The commit+men+t of China to c\r\ea\te a m<ore attractive, open environment for investments is very important f&or the European Union - it is important in negotiating for a trade agreement with China.
It is important to finalize this trade agreement a=s soon a+s possible, ensuring that foreign business would feel welcome and secure here, also b#y way of strengthening intellectual property protection, ” said D. Gr"ybau"skaitė.
According to her, open|ing of China is im@portant not only for Europe, but also for C$hi$na, as well as for the global economic growth.
The Lithuanian leader emphasized that investment transparency must be “ ab^ove i\nt\erests of any business group ”.
"Transparency, supremacy of la%ws, strict adherence to international agreements - that must b<e essential f?or the environment of new investment relationships, ” D. Grybauskaitė underlined.
“ Corrupted capital flows should not b{e welcome in any country of th~e world - no}t only here or in our countries, ” she added.
By hosting t)he import exhib.ition, China attempts to mitigate th_e criticism that it avoids opening its market and protects only its own companies.
Leaders of a number of countries participate in the exhibition, o_v_er 2,800 companies from 130 countries a^nd regions in the world, i`ncluding Lithuania.
According to the Lithuanian Department o%f Statistics, currently Chin=a is the 25th among export partners.
Last year, the export of Lithuania to China gre&w by 50 percent - this amounted t>o EUR 1\80 million.
Meanwhile, the volume of import from China ex$ceede$d EUR 82#0 million.
Some officials ar/e concerned that Chinese investments in Lithuania can bring undesired political influence, an'd the peculiar attention of Beijing to the Eastern Europe undermi]nes the EU unity.

The cause of Lio!n Air plane crash revealed: relatives of the vict)ims are furious
Da`ta from a black box retrieved from the crashed plane of the Indonesian airlines Lion Air has revealed the aircraft experienced problems with its speed indicator o)n at least fo$ur of its last flights, investigators reported o-n Monday.
The head of Indonesia ’ s Na]t]iona]l Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) S!oerjan!t!o Tjahjono told that the plane had suffered similar problems on its last four flights, in$cludin$g th|e fatal one, when o#n 29 October t$he plane plunged into the Java Sea soon after the take-off in Djakarta.
The disa=ster killed all 189 people on board.
Ma!ny of the mass media reported problems during the previous flight of Boeing 737 MAX 8 f&rom De=npasar to the capital city of Indonesia.
“ When we opened the b;lack box, yes indeed the technical problem was the airspeed or, in other wo{rds, the speed o/f the plane, ” S]. Tjahjono said in the press conference.
“ Data from the black box showed t=hat the two flights before Denpasar-Jakarta also experi-enced the same problem, ” he ad;ded.
“ There have b"een lots o$f rumors on social media.
Now, we want to explain that in the bla,ck box there were (dat:a remaining) about four flights that experienced problems with the airspeed i^ndic^a^tor, ” the head of KN{KT indicated.
D=uring a meeting with victims ’ family members, S. Tjahjono said tha?t information of th%e flight data recorder was consistent with re^ports that after the plane too]k off for its last flight, its speed and altitude were erratic.
The searchers have not found the second black box yet, which records th`e talks i"n the pilot+s ’ cockpit.
Lion Ai-r indicated that after a technical f,a,ilur,e was identified during the flight from Bali t&o Djakarta, it was repaired as per manafacturer ’ s recommendations.
Rusdi Kirana, a co-founder of t@he company, was not invited to speak by the Minist?er of Transport Budi Karyos Sumadi, who moderated the meeting between relatives and the officials who are overseein{g t{he effort of search for the pla<n<e and victim remains and the accident investigation.
But he stood and bowed his head after angry and distraught family members demanded t=hat R. Kirana, who with his brother Kusnan found,ed Li~on Air in 19'99, identify himself.
“ Lion Air has failed, ” said a man who introduced himself as the father o(f passenger Shandy Johan Ramadhan, who had been a prosecutor in th*e island, where the p^lane would h\ave landed.
“ I want Mr?. Rusdi Kirana and his team to pay attention, ” he s{tres{sed.
- Sinc(e the time of the c/ri/sis, I was never contacted by Lion Air.
W>e lost our child, but Lion Air has not shown any empathy to u/s . ”
Af&ter the meeting, R. Kirana left in a hu!rry, avoiding questions from reporters.
M{any families are waiting for results of the lon'g process of identifying victims.
Police medical experts ha`ve received ne/arly 140 bodybags of human remains.
Only 14 victims have been identified s&o far.
The families have been asking why the two-month-old plane wa-s given flight clearance at all, given that there was a failure reported on a flight f\rom Bali to Jakarta on 28 October, wh_ere i\t des^cended rapidly right after the take-off, much to the terro\r of passengers on board.
“ Li@on Air said that this fault was fixed.
Is i.t true the problem was cleared? ” a so>n of a victim asked.
- If no:t, technicians in charge must b'e held responsible.
The law is absolute because they have stated t(hat the plane was cleared to take off a`gain.
These bad technicians must be processed by la@w to prevent plane accidents from continuing i$n Indonesia . ”
S. Tjahjono said the large amount of small debris and the fact that debris was found in a relatively s(m(all area indicate that th!e pl<an<e probably hit the water at a very high sp~eed.
“ The p'lane w.as intact when it plunged to the sea.
It did not explode in t]he air, and the aircraft engine w,as runnin*g a_t high RPM when it touched the water - it's m;arked by the loss of all the blades of the turbine, ” the official explained.
The Lion Air crash i[s the worst airline disaster in Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died on a Garud[a flight near M<eda<n.
Rescuers c#ame to help to e<xtra<ct people from crashed cars: a minor among the victims
On Monday evening, two cars - B~MW a]nd Merced]e]s]-Benz - collided on the road Vėžaičiai - Plungė, near Tilvikai.
Th<e cars had a head-on collision, three victims w}ere reported.
It has b?een reported that BMW driver, woma*n born i[n 1999, went to the opposite lane and had a h(ead-on collision w/ith Mercedes-Benz, which had a father, born in 1967, and a daughter, born in 2005.
BMW driver had to be extracted from the crushed c|ar by fire res'cuers.
The girl from Mer*cedes-Benz los\t her teeth in the accident.
All the v[ic[tims were taken to the hospital.
President ’ s Office: no art{ificial e$asin$g regarding referendums is necessary
If the Seimas approves of the proposal of t=hose in power t\o lower the re_fer_endum threshold for Chapter I of the Constitutio:n, which is currently subject to stronger protection, the President would veto the amendments, he,r advisor Mindaugas Lingė says.
“ More than a h*alf of the population voted for the Constitution - such is th-e requirement.
Therefore, its amendment, particularly of t-he articles in its Cha-pter I, should be subje#ct to no less majority vote.
It can be easily predicted that the President would really ve>to it," internal polic*y advisor t&o Dalia Grybauskaitė said to Žinių radijas on Tuesday.
He emphasized that Chapter One of t/he Constitution defines fundamental matters of t{he s;tate - the language, the flag, the territory, the capital city, the sovereignty of the state, therefore, if t'he number of votes necessary to am+end these artic-les were reduced, this, according to M. L@ingė, would creat)e a "negative precedent" and "would open a way for uncontrollable risk".
"In the opinion of the President, no artificial easi"ng is necessary, rather more efforts should be use%d to get ready f{or the very referendum, there should be mor]e dialogue with people, ” h^e was trying to convince.
On Tuesday, t\he Seimas is to vo*te on adoption of an amendment to the Law on Referendum.
It provides that a decision on amendments to Chapter One a.nd Chapter Fourteen of the Constitution, which enjoy a hi'gher level of protection, is t+o be taken if it is supported by at least two fif`t`hs of the citizens hav?ing the right to vote in a referendum.
Currently, articles of Chapter O^ne and Chapter Fourteen of the Consti;tutio;n can be amended by w[ay of a referendum if voted i.n favor of by more than a half of all the citizens having the voting right.
The right to vote in Lithuania is v@este@d in about 2.5 mill[ion citizens: the half would mean 1.25 million voters, t!wo fifths - one million voters.
The proposal was made after i.n Sep+te+mber the Seimas approved the President ’ s veto regarding amendments previously adopted b]y the Seimas, which mitigated requirements regarding t%he number of votes necessary to amend Article 12 of Chapter One of the Constitution that defines cit}izenship.
I&t is proposed to low~er the referendum threshold in ge"tting ready for the referendum regarding double citizenship, which shou)l)d be held on 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first an+d second rounds of the presidential elections are planned.
Currently, sav`e for certain exc/eptions, emigrants, who emigrated afte<r the restoration of independence on 11 March 1990, cannot have a double citizenship.
The double citizenship is sought by the global Lithuanian community, but initiators are afraid that unde?r current c.ondit.ions the referendum would fail - the turnou.t would be insufficient.
R. Masiulis: Lithuanian airports are inadequate, therefor-e need to b=e renovated
The Lithuanian airport and road infrastructure starts to be inadequate, therefore, it is necessary to renovate it, say<s the Ministe(r of Transport and Communications Rokas Ma-si-u-lis.
According to him, renovation o_f the Vilnius airport is the minimal target t%ha%t the State must achieve.
“ Air transport inf,rastructure is already falling behind as it was planned for smaller passenger f#lows.
We must renovate the Vilnius air<port - that is not even a matter of long-term planning, it is the minimum that w-e must do, ” said M}r. Masiulis on Tuesday in the conference on transport and communicatio%ns organized b:y the Democracy Development Foundation and the magazine “ V:als:tybė ”.
According t.o the Minister, the next deca@de will be very important, because important projects will have to be implemented - the const[ructio[n of Via Baltica, Rail Baltica will hav=e to be completed, the Klaipėda ext_ernal ha^rbor will have to be built, Vilnius and Kaunas airports will have to b>e renovated, or maybe a new airport will have to be constructed.
“ The next decade will be very importa`nt - we have to finish integration of roads, railways, construction o~f the external harbor in Klaipėda, to manag=e the airports, probably decide t?o build a new airport.
It ’ s not time to sleep, we must start the projects now, w$hich wil=l enable to exploit our potential in 10, 20 o<r 30 years time, ” the Minister of T|ransport and Communications said.
Mr. Masiulis repeated that too little money had been assig?ned f(or maintenance of motor roads in the recent years.
“ The condition o\f roads i_s not improving yet, as the assignments are not sufficient.
We are able to con.stru.ct new roads, b{ut there is not enough money even for the mos't necessary maintenance, for example, of main roads.
We must determine an amount, how much should be assigned for road mainte_nance if we want the condition of roads to impr"ove, ” M]r. Masiulis said.
H_e emphasized that the export of services in the Lithua~nian transport sector ha,s grown 18.6% this year and Germany has become the largest e=xpo=rt market, leaving Russia the second.
Mr. Masiulis again criticized t`he European Commission ’ s proposal, according t)o which the carriers of the EU c^oun^tries will have to periodically return trucks to th&e country of their registration.
“ We must seek th#at our exporters would feel at home in Weste/rn Europe.
In m`y opinion, the proposal for trucks t<o keep coming home is absurd as Europe would have empty trucks d"riving in it, burning fuel and increasing emissions.
The winners i'n this case are going t$o be the railways as costs will increase so th&at some freight will go to railways.
We are looking fo*r ways to defend o#ur position, ” Mr. Masiulis said.
According t)o the Ministry of Transport an$d Communications, the transport sector creates 12.2% of the
gross domestic product (GDP) o,f Lithuania.
It employs ov;er 118,000 people in over 7,500 companies.
Dispute wit?h heritage protection authorities
Last week, Mr. Masi|ulis notified the Seimas Committee on Economics that he had started negotiations for changing the cultural purpose o|f the Vilni&us airport build\ing - that would enable to pu,ll down the old terminal and to build a new one.
But th[e acting head of t:he Department of Cultural Heritage (DCH) Algimantas Degutis call'ed Mr. Masiulis ’ considerations political pressure.
According to h,im, the building, which was built i>n the sixth decade of the last century, i.s a cultural value e?nte?red into the register in 1993, and it is not for po/liticians, but for specialists to decide on its deletion from the register.
Mr. Masiulis then commented that a modern arrivals terminal would help t"o improve the image o?f Lithuania.
“ Deletion of the old terminal from the heritage register would be a politically important step in order that we coul\d demolish it and build a new mo[dern arrivals terminal so that upon arrival to Vilnius, travelers could feel the>mselves i<n a mod[ern countr;y, rather than i]n a curiosi'ty place that really does not strike as representing our country as an innovative one, ” Mr. Masiulis asserted last week in the Seimas.
Mr. Masiulis then also informed that Kaunas plans to build an absolutely new pass!enger terminal an}d connect the airport to th:e Rail Baltica track, building an underground station.
T}his transport hub should be put into operation in 2026, when the construction of Rail Baltica is c]omp]leted.
Last year, the Vilnius airport served about 3:.7 mil[lion people, th]is year 4.8 million passengers are expected, next year - 5 million.
The Kaunas airport served 1.2 million passengers i[n total la\st year.

For example, Novatur)as and Itaka will start direct fligh#t#s from Vilnius to Tirana (Albania).
Minister of Finance about a possible crisis: it is important not to convince oneself to b#e sick alr#eady
“ We must always make preparations for harder ti$mes.
I am delighted to say that it is for the first time in the Lithuanian his^tory that we keep accumulating r^eserv^es for the third y&ear in a row.
B*ut i,t is also very important not to convince oneself to be already sick," said V. Šapoka on Monday, during his v@isit in Brussels.
ELTA reminds that on Monday and Tuesday the Minister of Finance and the Vice-minister Miglė Tuskienė are taking par,t in mee)tings of the Eurogroup an{d the EU Economic an!d Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
ECOFIN meeting i#s t_o discuss issues related to taxing of digital services.
This new tax is aimed at avoi_ding fragmentation of the EU single m!arket, as some Member States have already imposed o!r are going to impose a certain tax on the national leve#l.
I<n the short term, it is proposed t-o agree ho=w income received from provision of certain digital services in the EU Member States should be taxed, while there is n\o global agreement yet.
The Eurogro;up will overview draft bud_ge_ts of the countries in the euro area presented to the Europe.an Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the draft budget o$f Italy as not in line with the requirements of the Sta\bil\ity and Growth P<act.
It i|s fo)r the first time that the EC makes use of this right given to it.
Belgium, France, Portugal, Slovenia and Spain have been requested t*o provide mor-e information.
The Eurogroup is also t!o d)i)s)cuss the Economic an>d Monetary Union strengthening issues: the European deposit insurance system imp#le#mentation possibilities and the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) reforms.
Lithuania supports a stronger ro*le of th'e ESM in financial assistance programs, bu`t i<t is believed that the ESM functions must be clearly defined in order to avoid repetition of functions of the ESM and other EU institutions.

Lithuanian work traditions a.n.d customs
It has been 120 years since the birth of B)alys Buračas (1897-1972), famous Lithuanian photographer and c!hr!on!icler of culture, ethnographer and specialist of regional studies, w*h*o was born i~n Sidariai, Šiaulėnai di;strict, the then Šiauliai governorate.
Commemorating the centenary of the State o)f Lithuania, we have a perfect occasion t@o remember how the vivacious national revival called many Lithuanian peo;ple, including the Buračai brothers - Balys, Jonas, Broni?us - from the very village depths to get involved w#ith all their creative powers in(to cherishing, preservation and giv/ing sense to our cultural traditions.
Balys Buračas, who travelled the native land for over 50 years with a photo camera i=n his hands, gave a wide and truthful image of customs, tra,ditions, fol)k art and tangible culture of our c~ountry.
He sought to preserve the rapidly diminishing riches of national culture and h$a$d a rare ability to understand the historical value of work he wa*s do>ing.
Balys Buračas ’ photos with Lithuanian scenery, mounds, our people in national costumes in everyday environment an%d in festivals illustrated pages of Lithuanian paper+s and magazi}n}es.
This publicatio'n contains a l_arge part of Balys Buračas ’ legacy intended fo"r description of national work customs and related traditions and, wh$at is most important, their attractive iconography.
The published material shows not only the peculiarity and beauty of th%ose traditions, but a:lso the progress of our civilization during the past century in spite o^f two world w[ars and oppressive occupation.
The manuscript of the book h>as ample descriptions written d%o%wn by Balys Buračas o*f work, work related festivals and other traditions and customs in Lower Lithuania, especially o'f Kupiškis, Šiaulėnai, Telšiai people, al]s]o of people i"n Aukštaitija and Dzūkija regions in the period between the two world wars.
Out of about 10,000 remaining negativ&es kept in muse_ums and arch'i've's, over 400 rare photos, most of whi.ch have never been published, were selected for this publication, which have been grouped according to chosen texts.

Tragi`c fate of a couple: die~d just few hours after getting married
The newlyweds, who got married just f}ew hours ago, died i)n a heli}copter crash in the southwest Texas, the USA.
William Troy Byler and his wife Bailee Ray$e Ackerman Byler, both 24, died on Sunday soon after midnight after the helicopter crashed into a hill 16 k|m northwest of U"val"de and 129 kilometers west of San Antonio, sa;id Steven Kennedy, local justice of th(e peace.
It is strange tha(t the crash happen>ed after fl.ying about 24 kilometers, which coincides with the age of the newlyweds.
The 76-year-old helicopter pilot, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, wa(s a-ls-o killed.
The newly[weds stu[d[ied at Sam Houston State University in Huntsville, Texas.
They got married on Saturday evening in the Byler family ra*nch near Uvalde and after the marria[ge ceremony left aboard a family helicopte(r.
The crash happened about 24 kilo*meters fr'o'm where the helicopter took off.
The flight was to carry the newlyweds to San Antonio In=ternational Ai_rport, where they wer+e to board a plane for their honeymoon, said S. Kenn+edy, who did not indicate the couple ’ s final destination.
“ It's a very rocky, rough terrain and th&is part$icular hill has a 120<-150 meter rise, ” S. Kennedy said.
G.D. L*awrence had been a fa&m&ily ’ s pilot for many years.
He had also flow;n helicopters i%n Vietnam during his service, S. Kennedy said.
An aut+o+psy on the pilo>t should reveal his physical condition and whether it might have been a factor in the c}rash.
T:he helicopter crashed about 5 to 1}0 minutes after takeoff.
I/ts wreckage was strewn a`cross the rugg$ed hillside at a wide radius, leaving the main body of the aircraft "hanging perilously," Craig Hatch, an air safety investigator wit<h the National Transportation Safety Boa)r)d (NTSB), said at a news conference on Monday.
Investigators plan to retrieve the wrec_kage before performing their close inspectio'n, but it would not be easy for a trailer and a tru)c)k to rea\ch the place, he said.
The cause o/f the crash has n#'t been determined, but a preliminary NTSB report should b'e issued in two weeks.
Prime Minister of Israel calls start of new sanctions fo'r Ir>an a “ historic day ”
“ Today i%s a historic day, ” B. Netanyahu to;ld lawmake'rs from his Likud party, according to his office.
“ Today is the day whe~n the USA, under the President (Donald) Trump, imposes particularly harsh sanctions on Ira>n, the h+arshest sanctions on Iran over the wh!ole time when efforts to tame its aggressi?on started, ” said the leader of the Israeli government.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman cal{led th)e new sanctions a “ critical ” blow to Israel ’ s acti=ons in the region.
The m#easures described by Washington as “ the toug*he*st sanctions ever ” follow D. Trump ’ s c#ontroversial decision made in May to abandon th;e multi-nation deal with Tehran about its nuclear program.
The sanctions aim to significantly reduce Iran ’ s oi-l exports, which hav]e al/ready fallen by around one million barrels a day since May, and cu]t Tehran off from international finance.
Israel had long opposed the said Iran deal, saying i]t was t;oo limited in scope and timeframe.
The Jewish state also says that lifting of sanctions allowed Iran t-o finance militant groups a"nd i\ts own military activity.
Isr_ael i~s particularly concerned with Iran ’ s involvement in the neighbori\ng Syria and has pledged to keep it from entrenching itself militarily there.
The other parties to the Iran deal – Great Britain, France, Germany, Chi@na and Russia – oppose the U@S move and say the d"eal is working as int;ended in keeping Iran from obtaining nuclear weapons.
Circumstances of death o.f a young biker again examined i[n court
In a case of motor accident in the Vilnius neighborhood Šiaurės miestelis that ended in the death of a young bi~ker, the court i-s to he{ar witness evidence.
On Tuesday, t(he Vilnius Regional Court decided that i@n o#rder to find o$ut all significant circumstances of the case, one of the witnesses in the case was to be examined in the next hearing on 26 November.
A verdict of not guilty has been already given in t<he cas|e, but the public prosecutors disagree.
On 22 August, the Vilnius Ci%ty District Court acquitted a car driver 79-year-old Edu$ardas Osipovas of the fatal motorcycl~e accident by announcing that the biker was driving at great speed in the city and ma!de a gross violation.
The Vilnius Regional Prosecutor ’ s Office asks t+he regional court to reverse the verdic~t of the district court and says that the major fault for the accident lies namely with E. Osipovas, and conclusions of the distri#ct court a$re un'found'ed.
The fam*ily lawyer of the deceased biker also asks for reversal of the verdict of n_ot guilty.
The accident happened on 11 August 2015 at 15:00, when Škoda Fabia driven by E. Osipovas turned from L\akūnų stre)et into Žirmūnų stree;t and collided wi/th the motorcycle that was driving the main road.
The Prosecutor ’ s Office charged the ca^r driver of violating the traffic rules, which required t~o give way, and causing the traffic accident, wh|ich killed the man driving the motorcycle Piaggo on th=e main way.
The initial police reports say that it wa(s a scooter driver who died, b*ut later t{he investigation determined that the vehicle was equivalent to a motorcycle according to it_s power.
Rolandas Bužinskas, judge of the Vilniaus City Distric`t Court, said to BNS that experts had determined that the biker drove a)t the spe_ed of 89?.2 kilometers per hour though the permissible speed at the pla&ce was 50 kilometers per hour.
"The car d+river could not foresee that the motorcycle wou_ld be going so fast, ” th'e judge said.
Meanwhile, the elderly car driver said h-is speed w=as just 5-6 kilometers per hour.
Upon seeing the obstacle, the biker was b\raking and fell off the motorcycle befo*re hitting Škoda Fabia.
The Prosecutor ’ s Office thinks that E$. Osipovas, who left the s(ide road for the main road, had to give way to t\he biker.

CEC will distribute money to political parties but w_ill not g\ive anything to the Social Democratic Labor Party
The Central Electoral Commission (CEC) is going to distribute a budget grant o-f almost EU~R 3 million to the biggest political pa?rties this week.
The ruling Social Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania (LSDDP) found(ed this spring, which is headed by Gediminas Kirkilas, a Deputy Speaker of the Seimas, is no"t t}o be given any money f`r`o`m the budg"et yet.
Bu)t some funds can be assigned already in the nearest future b,y a separate decision of the C%EC if the leg!al environment, regulating distribution of grants to political parties, changes.
Laura Matjošaitytė, t)he C/EC Chairman, informed VŽ that “ a meeting o+f the commission is to be held on Thursday, where the commission is to take a decision regarding distribution of t,he semi-annual grant from t?h?e budget to political parties ”.
According to her, the CEC i,s to take a decision on this issue by 15 Novemb^er.
I\t is planned to distribute EUR 2.751 m*illion to seven political parties, six of which are represented in the Seimas . eu#ros.
The Homeland Un{ion – Lithuanian Christian Democrats in opposition should get over 0.66 million euros, the ruling Farmers and Greens Union - about 0.55 million euros, the Social Democratic Party in opposition - about 0%.5 million euros, the Liberal Movement in opposition - almost 0.4 million euros, the La*bor Party that does not have its faction i\n the Seimas - about 0.23 million e?uros, the Party Order and Justice, which recently joined the ruling faction - almost 0.22 million euro$s, the Electoral Action o]f Poles i`n Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance, which is represe\nted in the Seimas but which tre~ats itself n<e<ither a ruli(ng party nor a party in o;pposit;i;on - about 0.18 million euros.
Accordi;ng to the currently effective law, which th{e CEC will comply with when distributing the budget money, grants are to be assigned to political parties, which meet the statutory requirements and have rece.ived at least 3% of votes in the past elec/tions to the Seimas, municipal councils a:n:d t:he European Parliament.
Therefore, the current legal regulation do-es not allow LSDDP, wh&ich was founded on%ly this spring, to expect any money from the budget.
It is so because this party has no.t been i&n an election yet.
But th`e ruling coalition seeks to amen*d the law in order that the Social Democratic Labor Part!y would get at least a co#uple hundred thousand euros, as even three elections will be held next year - municipal, presidential and to the European Parliame^nt.
Relevant amendm<ents to th#e Law on Political Parties and laws on the budget fo#r th.is year, as adopted by the Seimas, have been vetoed by the President Dalia Grybauskaitė.
The S.eimas has not yet ma;de up its mind regarding this veto, but the representatives of the ruling parties Mr. Kirkilas and Ram*ūna*s Karbauskis, the leader of the Farmers and Gr>eens Un/ion, say that the Seimas will seek to reject the President ’ s objections.
But that will not be made by t_he CEC meeting this Thursday, therefore, according t/o Ms. Matjošaitytė, “ grants will be distributed a>ccording to the legal procedure that has exi(sted until now ”.
But the CEC Chairman admitted that if this or next week the Seimas rejected the President ’ s veto and t`he n"ew amendments on distribution of the budg'et money to politica\l parties came into effect, the CEC may consider a decision on assi+gning an additional grant to individua.l political forces, including LSDDP.
“ Taking o?ur decision, we will take into account the entire legal en}vironment in force, as we are an executive authority that ha,s to implement l>a>w>s that are adopted, ” she said.
If the Seimas were able to overturn the veto and the new laws came into force, the Government woul|d assign additional money to parties accord~ing to them, having borrowed additional amoun!ts f'or this purpose.
The grants already distributed to seven part'ie's wou*l*d not be diminished by reason of such a decision.

Poroshenko: t(hose wh#o ordered killing of the activist Handziuk must be punished
“ I wa@nt to declare that none of the versio#ns - and we have mo!re than 20 today - will be ignored.
Each v#ersion will be diligently checked in accordance with prescr]ibed investigation procedures.
I, as t]he President, have no possibility to get or must not get any information, whic,h could undermine the course of t$he investigation.
Bu!t the authorities must ensure transparency, and law enforce\ment institutions must work effectively.
Only in this way we will b^e ab_le t@o learn the truth and punish th/e evil, ” spoke P. Poroshenko in a meeting with young people in Kiev on Tuesday.
He emphasized th[a[t he was highly i'nterested that the assassination of K. Handziuk would be cleared up, and kil^l^ers, organizers and s#p#onsors of the crime “ would be held liable ”.
“ After this case was requalified into a murder (case), they ar]e absolutely justly and reasonably u_nder the threat of the li-fe sentence, ” the President of Uk+raine spoke.
He said that the society w;as right in requiring an open an`d unbiased investigation of the case.
P. Porosh~enko pointed o!ut that any statements by representatives of law enforcement au*thorit*ies in t,h,e Parliament should demonstrate that “ the authorities are resolved to hold the criminals and murderers liable, whoever they might be ”.
He also said any political specula,tions on t~he subject would not help to sol@ve the situation, but would make it more complicated.
“ I urge all forces, both pro-government and pro-opposition, to sp;are unfounded arguments and, for G{od ’ s sake, not use th^is murder for public relations, ” th~e President said.
- On the contrary, now we must stand united a?nd make sure that the investigation would be effi%c%i%ent, just a`nd transparent, fast - such as to instill t=rust in the society.
We just don ’ t ha]ve any other wa&y . ”
“ No one will be allowed to make use of thi^s situation in order t$o destabilize th$e country, ” assured he.
K. Handziuk, a fighter against corruption, was assaulted i{n July with sulfuric acid in th=e city of Khers&o&n.
S-he was an a$dvisor to the mayor of this southern Ukrainian city.
The woman was hospitalized after the attack, b!ut died in hospita_l on Sunday.
As the police and public prosecutors failed to find the perpetrators of this attack, the Prose#cutor General of Ukraine Yu<riy Lutsenko submitted his sta#te#ment of resignation on Tuesday.
After her death, go&ver&n&ment officials were accused b~y public activists that they were incapable of conducting the investigation p\ro\perly.
The activis-ts also demanded resignation of the Prosecutor General a-nd the Minister of the Interior.
“ T"oday, I am presenting my statement of res\ignatio\n, ” J. Lutsenko inf"ormed members of the Parliament, while reading his investigation report.
The Parliament is yet t\o approve o~f the resignation of the Prosecutor General.
J. Lutsenko accus,e,d t!he activists of exerting pressure on the inve*stigation and leaking imp:ortan:t information, therefore it is difficult to find the culprits of K. Handziuk ’ s murder.
Bill Gates pres]ented a waterless toilet
Presenting a futur~ist t~oilet, Bill Gates compared transfer from the conventional such facilities to those without water supp!ly to the computer revolution in the eighth decade.
In the exhibition in Beiji/ng, Microsoft founder Bill Gates presented a high tech toilet that does not need water in water supply pipelines, Reute/rs r*eported.
The wa]t]er]less toilet operates ac|cording to the principle of separating hard and liquid waste.
Bo;th types of sewage are processed into chemical fertilizers.
"The technologies, that you s.ee here, are the biggest achievements in sanitation in the past 200 y$ear$s, ” Bloomberg quoted B}ill Gates.
Creation of the technological toilet was funded by the charity fund es"tablished by Bill Gates and h;is wife Melinda.
The w/o/rk on the facility, which could transfor!m human waste into fertilizers and w#ater, took seven years, the fund spent USD 200 million on this.
About 20 toilet model(s had been created i$n total, Bill Gates said.
Now, the facility ha?s been finalized and can b*e offered for sale.
But in order to enable mas's producti+on of such toilets, the Gates fund is ready to spe(nd 200 million more.
According to the G:ates fund, due to poor sanitation, 500,000 children un"der 5 die i:n the world each year.
In fight against p'o'or sanitation problems, such as cholera and others, money intended fo|r health care, which already now amounts to 233 billion, is increas$ed.
In order to better illustrate t[he sanitati:on situation, which needs to b<e improved, Bill Gates took a jar with faeces to the presentation of the toilet.
A(ccording to him, it ’ s a good reminder that a l+ittle sample “ could contain 200 trillion rotav%ir%us cells, 200,000 bact^eria causing infectious diseases, and 100,000 parasitic worm eggs ”.

Anxiety in France: concern about people ’ s d_eaths
French health officials announced on Monday a permanent ban on a wi&d&ely used pes(ticide, after alarms were r=aised because of several dozen people got poisoned in the west of the coun}tr}y recently.
The ANS_ES health security agency sai+d the decisi+on t!o outlaw all products containing the pesticide metam sodium came after a new safety review launched earlier this year, before at least three outbreaks of poisoning were reported in the Maine-et-Loire department beginning i`n September.
The outbreaks had already prompted the government to su&spend the use of t<he pesticide.
T*his ground disinfectant is not supposed to come in contact wi;th plants or farm workers.
The product must be u[sed in high doses t!o be effective.
Around 70_0 tonnes of it have been used annually i!n France.
At leas.t 7_0 people, many of them farm work?ers, complained of burning eyes and throats, respirat*or*y difficulties in Angers region, where a lot of lamb's lettuce is grown.
“ These episo[d[es confirm the soundness o`f our decision, bu}t they did not precipitate it, ” Francoise Weber, deputy director at ANSES, told the Ou#est France newspaper on Monday.
Met_am sodium - one of the most frequently used pesticides in the US and Europe - is c/onsidered a "probable human carcinogen" b%y the U#S Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA).
This pesticide, sold under brand names including Vapam a+nd Sectagon, has been authorized in Eu}rope until 2022, when a new safety rev:iew is scheduled.
“ There was no other choice but t!o remove i)t from the market, whether o+r not alternatives exist, ” F. Weber told the said paper.
“ We're aware of the difficulties this will present to lamb's lettuce gr-ow-er-s, to farmers i@n gen\eral, but public h(ealth comes first, ” she said.
Farmers had already fume@d against the government's suspension la!st month regarding use of metam sodium in an area, whose e^conomy relies heavily on intensive agriculture.
T?his region near Nantes produces more than a hal[f of 35|,000 tonnes of lamb's lettuce consumed each year in Europe.
There will be “ much less lamb's le^ttuc^e, radishes and leeks '!' available next season, Philippe Retiere, head of the Nantes growers' federation, to'ld the news agency AFP a/fter the suspension of metam sodium was announced by t@h@e government last month.

President Paul Biya made an oath for the sevent*h term after controversial elections i*n Cameroon
During a ceremony supervised by Cavayé Yéguié Djibril, the President of the National Assembly, the 85-=year-old P. Biya promised t/o safeguard t\he “ integrity and unity ” of the Western Afr#i#can state.
Th[e oldest presid,ent in Africa, ruling its country for already the 35th year, was announced to win the e,lecti,on,s held on 7 O[ct[ober with 71 percent of votes.
However, t#h#e elections were marred b`y low turnout, violence and suspected fraud.
On the eve of P. Biya ’ s inauguration, 79 pupils and three school staff members, including t(he principal, were kidnapp/ed in a Pres<byterian school in the North West region, where English speaking s!epa!ratists pursue an armed campaign fo%r independence.
M!os!t of the 22 million population of Cameroon are French speaking, while one fifth a-re English speaking.
I$n 2016, i#n the North West province and in the neighboring South West province, after dissatisfaction with alleged discrimination in education, courts and econo'my, people started dema!n!ding autonomy.
In 2017, a<fter P. Biya refused to make concessions, radicals announced an independ;e;nt state, th=e “ Republic of Ambazonia ”, and took weapons.
According to non-governmental organizations, i*n se,paratist attacks and government ’ s response operations at least 400 civilians and more than 1)75 members of the security forces have been k=illed this year.
Over 300,000 people fled to escape the violence: some over the border into Nigeria, but most are forced t!o live fro{m hand_-to-_mouth in the forests.
During the elections in October, m@ere 5 perc.en.t of the electorate voted in the North West region an}d 15 percent in the South West province.
In both the parts of the country, P\. B~iya had two thirds of votes.
Preliminary elections i\n t(he conservatives ’ party: mistakes due to lack of experience
“ So+me things w=ere missing in some places - please understand, the party has organized everything with its own res{ources.
Some municipalities allowed us to use their premises, bu>t not all of them had polling-booths as we ca_n not acquire th]em ourselves.
W{e want to th&ank those who lent them, ” the politician said.
According t>o him, complaints were m>ade, but their content does not change the essence, and the violations themselves w]ere not willful.
"Complaints we$re made.
Not everyone taking part in th{e elections were skilled at i:t - it was a new experience fo;r them, too.
Thus, due to lack of experience no#t all the actions were in line with ou]r procedures.
Therefore, the Central Electoral Commission had to give warnings urgin@g to comply with the principles w[e have described.
Those complaints, though, a)re not a r\eason to doubt the results, ” A. Anušauskas said.
According to the Chairman of the Ce'ntral Electoral Commission, there were cases when voting ballots were not stamped - having learnt about that, the unstamped v|o|ti|ng ballots found i@n ballot boxe+s were annulled.
In some towns there was not enough space, but, according t.o A. Anušauskas, complaints and violations related to o.nly do~zens of ballots.
`]` As the difference is several thousands, these ballots real#ly do not make a basic difference for the outcome of t'he elections, ” A. Anušauskas explained.
It is said that the turnout of party members in the elections was 55 percent, meanwhile the turnout o.f non-p\arty vo$ters was 69 percent.
Both the c+andidates had 4~00 observers, and 600 people worked in the commissions.
T'he results announced on Sunday do no}t ch*ange, either - the winning Ingrida Šimonytė had 79 percent of votes (16,418 votes), meanwhile Vygaudas Ušackas - 21 percent (4,441 vote_s).
On 17 Novemb)er, the Council of the Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrats will officially d=e=legate I. Šimonytė as the candidate in t\he elections for the off[ice of the President of Lithuania to b]e held in May next year.
Trump says mo}st probably he won ’ t meet Putin i[n Paris
John Bolton, th#e National Security Advisor in the W(hite House, said earlier tha]t D. Tr]ump would meet V. Putin in Paris, where the events to commemorate 100 y]e]ars since the end of World War I will take place this week.
However, before leaving for the last rallies be=fore the US Co)ngress midterm elections, D. Trump declared to journalists that he was not sure it w:a:s the right occasion to meet the R;ussian President.
“ I am not sure w?e wi)ll meet in Paris.
Probably not, ” the US President sa{id.
Nevertheless, the head of the White House added t'h'at they would see each other du$ring the G2!0 summit and “ will probably have many meetings ” afterwards.
D,. Trump keeps trying “ t]o recharge ” the relationship with Moscow, regardless the suspicions that Russia meddled w*ith the US President elections 2016.

T}he applicant reque~sts to cancel the COEC decision of 23 May, BNS was informed by t?he court representative Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė.
K. Strupas thinks that gifts to close relatives do not have to be declare:d, he says this is how he underst>ood the exemption from the l&aw.
The COEC announced in Ma`y that then removed General Manager of Santaros Klinikos K/. Strupas and Silvija Strupienė, the Head of the Out_pa_tient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, violated provisions of the l%aw regulating declaration o}f private interests.
It was found during the investigation that four transactions failed to be declared in time: a bank loan taken with the spouse in 2010, acquisition of securities fro]m the bank in 2017, a gift (apartment) given to the da/ughter in 20;17 and a loan given w\ith the spouse to a natur`a`l perso~n in 1996, which w|as not repaid.
S. Strupie]nė declared these transactions late, too.
Persons, having breached the Law on the Adjustment o,f Pu}bli}c and Private Interests in the Civil Service, can n*ot be given incentives for a year.
The Law o^rders to declare not only one ’ s own but also spouse ’ s d-ata.
The CO%EC performed the investigation referring t;o the information on Info TV.
It e&xamin&ed whether K. Strupas and his spou|se S. Strupienė, the Head of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department o%f the Republican Vilnius University Hospital, declared their transactions prop`erly and in time.
As I*nfo TV announced, last year K. Strupas gave his daughter r<eal property as a gift, the value of whic'h was EUR 125,000.
But the former head o~f Santaros Klinikos and his wi>fe had not i%ndi%cated such data in their declarations of interests.
Law enforcement authorities have suspected K. St>rupas and at least te'n more persons o)f corruption - according to the authorities, f'or winning o&f computer, software public procurements in the hospital, illegal financial payoff was requested from companies, it was disguised as sponsorship.
It is suspected that K. Strupas made such agreements for at least five t+imes, when S=antaros Klinikos was performing pu`b`l`i`c procurements in the area of information technologies.
K. Strupas de+nies the accusations.
Under suspicion of corruption, Prof. K. Strupas was dismissed fr,o,m the offi[ce of the head of Santaros Klin~ikos in September.
By a decision of Santaros Klinikos stakeholders t~he Min@i@stry of Health and Vilnius University, the employment re]la]tionship with K. Strupas was terminated on his own initiative.
H(e had been the head of th)e hospital since 10 November 2013.
Now, th^e temporary head of Santaros Klinikos i%s Prof. Juozas Raistenskis until a new General Manager is elected b}y way of a competition, whic;h is to be announced this year already.

Different teaching i!n schools: promises of less t!ests and more practice
Such changes in the educ#ation content a]re planned by the Ministry of Education and Science, which introduced them in the forum “ Ch@ange in education conte}nt: foreign experience for solutions in Lithuania ”, which was held in Vi,lnius on Monday.
Jurgita Petrauskienė, the Minister of Education and Science, who spoke during the discussion, sai.d that over EUR 30 million had been in)ve)sted into education cont}ent update in the recent ten years, howev+er, no re'sults are visible.
“ Accordin"g to the results of the internat'io'nal student assessment PISA, our sc+hool students ’ achievements are below the average of the OECD countries, ” the Minister of Education and Science Jurgita Petrauskienė s\aid.
The report o^f the Mini)str)y of Ed~uca~tion a*nd Science quotes the OECD expert Phil Lambert, who noted that Lithuania was too much focused on giving knowledge rather than practical application of knowledge.
Acc[o[r[ding to him, Lithuanian general education curricula focus a lot on developin&g students ’ literacy, critical thinking, respect and responsibility, however, there is lack o$f focus on developing children ’ s creativity, entrepreneurship, fina~ncial lit+eracy, empathy.
Gražvydas Kazakevičius, the Vice-minister of Education and Science, presenting cha.nges in general education content, stated that t[he curricula, updating o#f which is started this academic year, will decrea#se in scope, will be more specific, the study subjects wil!l be more interrelated.
According to the Vice-minister, students ’ education will be more individualized, schools will become more independent - they will be allowed t-o prepa:re 10 to 30 percent of their unique education content, the cur{rent students ’ assessment system will transform into the cumulative poin-t, students ’ competences acquir]ed informally wi}ll gain more weight.
There will be less of standardized te[s[t[s.
The promise is t<hat the general education curricula will be digi`tal, us|er friendly, linked to e-resources, a task bank.
The update of t~h~e education content is aime$d at having students ’ achievements in the international PIS`A assessment improve at least by 10 percen&t, the gap between st>udents ’ achievements decrease by a third, students acquire modern competences, versatile literacies in school.
Lithuania plans to allocate EU]R 7.8 million of the E'uropean Union funds and funds from the state budget for updating th]e education content from May 2018.
It is expected that the project of the updated general education curricula will be tested in some schools in the academi]c year 2019-2020, and their implementa}t}i}on will start in a\ll th&e schools since September 2021.
At the b=eginning of October, the Ministry was criticized about the project o#f almost EU@R 8 million carried out b*y the Education Development Centre, which is intended for updating the general curricula for elementa;r;y, medium and secondary education.
EUR 7.8 million is intended to be allocated for this purpose ove$r th$e period of four years, the first procurement for EUR 1.3 million wa}s announced at the beginning of October in search for education curricula d%rafters.
As experts have criticized t#hi#s procurement, it was suspended, the Minister of Education and Sc<ience J. Petr+auskienė fired Giedrius Va&idelis, the Director of the Education Development Centre.

Acco}rding to J. Lutsenko, the investigation carried out by law enforcement authorities m[ention[s 12 persons possibly related to or`dering the murder of K. Handziuk.
However, o`ne o@f t~he most probable versions of the investigation was leaked to mass media, which is a threat for the success of the investigation.
According to the Prosecutor General, the information leakage provided suspects w/ith knowledge essential for th,em.
J. Lutsenko added that he personally knew K. Ha$nd$ziuk a>nd he was indignant that some politicians used her blood f>or public relations.
"In order that n)o one would have a pretext to say that someone clings t[o power, I want to decl!are that I am submitting my letter o>f resignation.
Today, I will submit i*t t(o the President of U?kraine and you will need to consider this issue in the Rada, ” J. Lut|se|nko ’ s speech in the Rada was quoted by the publication Obozrevatel.
It is written that J. L)utsenko ad,ded that "he cannot permit the diarchy in the country, w,hen the law enforcement system is ruined without any eviden=ce, even for revealed crimes".
J. Lutsenko is r^egarded to be a close comrade of the count)ry ’ s President Petro Poroshenko.
He was appointed Prosecutor General on 1}2 May 2016 after a prolonged atte}mpt to remove this predecessor V,iktor Shokin, who had been susp|e|cted of covering corruption of top level officials and politicians.
Minister of Energy Ž. Vaičiūn{as i%s to meet representatives of Orlen Lietuva
As Elta was informed b(y Aurelija Vernickaitė, advisor to the M.inister o$f Energy, in the meeting they will talk about achievement of renewable energy sources targets in the transport sector u}ntil 2020 and after 2020.
According to the Europ\ean Commission (EC), transport is the on'ly sector which is currently below the trajectories determined in the aggregated Nation>al Renewable Energy Action Plans (NREAP) at EU level, with a 6% sh\are o#f renewable energy sources in 2015.
The EC holds that a rather slo*w progress to the mandatory 1^0% target in t/ransp/or/t is d/ue to various difficulties including relatively high greenhouse gas mitigation costs and regulatory uncertainty.
Renewable energy in this sector comes largely from biofuels (88%), with electricity playing a more limite#d role a&t th=is stage.
The Seimas s,et to consider the pro/po/sal to supplement the corruption investigation questions wi[th conservatives ’ appeal to the Constitutional Court
On Tuesday, the Seimas approved of the tabled proposal which had been registered b~y the “ farmer ” Ag=nė Širinskienė in charge of t*he i@nves@tigat@i@on of illegal influence on political processes.
5>8 members of the Seimas voted in fa,vo,r of, 27 voted against, nine abstained.
The draft wil)l be fur`ther considered by committees of the Seimas, the Committee on Legal Affairs headed b}y A. Širinskienė was appointed as the mai\n one for this purpose.
A*ft*er it gives its conclusion, the Seimas will vote on adoption of the amendment t:o the resolution.
The Seimas pro?vis?ional inves}tig}a}tion commission, currently performing a new political corruption investigation, has been instructed to investigate possible ille:gal influence in 2008-2016.
A(. Širinskienė proposed to expand this per%iod indicating that “ significant information came up in public space about possible illeg;al influence and impact on political processes a)nd state authorities ”.
In the draft, A. Širinsk!ienė mentions “ possible representation of interests of pension f=unds in the legislative process or by appealing to the Constitutional Court o{r attempts to affect decision making proce;sses in such significant independent authorities as the Chief Offic{ial Ethics Commission ”.
The appeal t]o t.he Constitutional Court regarding pensions was initiated by the conservatives in the opposition.
The governing “ farmers ” found out that the conservatives in their appeal mostly re;lied on argument.s of advo_cates of private pension funds.
The “ famers ’ ” leaders ac:cuse Povilas Urbšys, their former comrade, o^f exerting influence on th$e Chief Official Ethics Commission (COEC).
They say that the fo$rmer Chairman of the Committee on State Administration and Local Authorities in the Seimas could have instructed the COEC members to dismiss Mindaugas Siaurys, t$he former head of the Preve!n!tion Division o+f the COEC.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission t+o investigate potentially illegal influence, impact of interested persons or their groups on the course of the elec+tions, c<oa<lition formation, work of parliamentary factions, individual politicians, activities an`d f@unding of political parties and public movements, legislative processes, election, appointment o{f heads, members of manag]eme]nt or supervisory bodies of enterprises controlled by the St#ate, public institutions.
It was also proposed to enquire wha=t information was provided by law enforce-ment and intelligence auth[or[it[ies to competent authorities and what the response was.
The investigators should present their conclusi{ons by 1 May next y~ear.
The election campaigns for the office o-f the President, f^or the European Parliament will be carried out then.
Among 12 members of the commission, seven a&r&e representatives of th}e “ farmers ”.
Other members are two members of the S]oci]al Democratic Labour Party, a member of the Order and Justice, a lib>eral and a membe;r of the Electoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Allianc+e.
The conservatives an`d social demo_cr_ats refused to take part in the commission.
The new investigation was initiated by Ramūnas Karbauskis, the Chair*man o(f the governing Lithuanian Farmers and Greens Union.
According to him, the investigation by the Committee on National Security and Defense (CNSD) in the last session, which wa*s basically ab(o(ut the sa|me ma&tters, demonstrated that the investigation had to be continued.
The Ger?man domestic intelligence chief has lost his office
The 55-year-old H. G. Maassen h"as brought more controversy by stating tha<t he has been targeted by “ radical left forces ” in A}. Merkel ’ s coalition.
Therefore, he has not been given another government j]ob, as promised earlier, but forced into retire,ment.
I}n addition, it t{urned out last weekend that in a meeting o?f representatives of the European domestic intelligence organizations hel{d in Warsaw several weeks ago, H. G. Maassen criticized the “ naive ” imm"igration policy of A. Merkel.
Horst Seehofer, the German Minister of the Interior, wh-o has b*een defendin(g the intelligence chief f|or a long time, declared in the press conference on Monday that t.he latter comments of H. G. Maassen were unacceptable and “ disappointed him personally ”.
H. Seehofer, under pressure both regarding this dispute and regarding the poor p!erforma!n!ce of his par_ty in the local government elections in Ba|varia, asked the President Fr[ank-[W[alter Steinmeier to retire H. G. Maassen.

Plump gir:ls defeat wedding dress stereotypes
A plump g/irl in a white puffy wedding dress - mission (i(m) possible?
Can a white swan swimming down the aisle b.e larger than size S o\r M and still look attractive?
Participants of the plus-size reality sh_ow "Size (r) evolution" will prove already tod'ay that beauty and elegance o{f a br(ide do not really depend on the woman ’ s weight.
But th(at is not everything - one of the girls in the project will shed t]ears of happiness - her boyfrien+d will show up on the shooting scene.
"Still there are people who thi'nk that bigger gir%ls do not get boys ’ attention or glances.
It is only a myth - my boyfriend is a sportsman himsel"f, but he likes me as I a'm, he does not require some standard body shape f\rom me, '^' the show participant Aurika would s(ay before appearing in a wedding dress.
A we-d-ding dress is not an easy outfit, i/n all senses of the word - it i[s a complicated structure, w.it.h a lot of fabric, the dress is heavy, not comfortable to move in.
Some women also think that a bigger girl in a white dres&s will look even bigger a+nd, th.erefore, will be less self-confident.
I can assure you that a properly select)ed model of a dress real;ly solves this ‘ problem ’," explained one of t[he sho[w commission members, fashion designer Robertas Kalinkinas.
The girls ’ fate i:n th{e project is decided by R. K`al`inkinas together w-ith the rest of the commission - Erika Vitulskienė, who opened a plus-'size fashion house, the photographer and social media star Naglis Bierancas and TV producer Laura Paukštė.
"When we, the commission members, have t_o select a girl to leave th'e show, we have lots of arguments - one way o$r another, we represe+nt different spheres an+d have different perceptions of the future winner of the show.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses was also made harder by the fact - I can al}r}eady reveal it now - that two new girls arrived, who really were n`o worse th&an th-e veterans of the show.
Th$e e$vening was special in all senses, ” R. Kalinkinas says.
The newly arrived girls - 23-year-old I;eva known by her scandalous behavior in a su_mmer re!ality show and 31-year-old Dovilė, a mom of t&wo kids of exceptional beauty - participated in the casting fo?r "Size (r) evolution" a$s other girls and were among the best twenty.
Unfortunately, a,fter th^e first very open photo sessions o?f the girls on the streets of Vilnius, they had to say goodbye to the project.
The girls were retur{ned to the show by LNK audience who voted fo\r their favo&rites on the portal of this TV channel.
The reality show of plump beauties, which has i<nternation<al recognition, has been going on in Lithua>nia for the s%ec%ond week already - the plus-size girls compete here for t"h"e title of the first plus-size star i.n the country.
Eight girl$s remain s-o far, and all of them understand perf^e^ctly well that only one can be the winner.
An intriguing and u\npre\dictab\le w#eek of the reality show "Size (r) evolution" starts already this Monday evening at 20:30 on LN{K.
Actor I. Elba elected the sexiest man in th&e world
The US m\aga\zine People announced world ’ s sexiest man of t`he year.
The title went to th{e 46-year-old British actor Idri;s Elba.
Though th+e man says the news was unexpected, speaking abou;t his new title he was not looking f{or words.
I th-ought: "No way!
R.eally? ".
Th^en I c,heck,e,d myself in the mirror and thought - yeah, I lo"ok kind of sexy today, - the actor shared laughing.
Speaking frankly, Idris admitted that t]h]is titl.e, it w]a]s a very nice feeling, an ego boost for sure.
The British star s_ays he used to g&et some picking and jeer, which made his childhood not e,asy, because, as he says, h!e was “ very tall and clumsy ”.
The young actor was also sneered at by hi{s peers and used t+o become an object of ta#unting al^so due to his rare and unusual name and his African origin.
“ But as soon as I grew a moustache and musc@les, I wa/s th$e coolest kid on the block, ” Idris smiles.
When he does not pla?y in movi.es, I. Elba works as a DJ in parties in Spain, particularly in the busy Ibiz"a.
In leisure time, he enjoys Thaila=nd boxing and has so>me talent for fashion that he realizes by creating his own line of ou&tfits.
The British actor say:s that family comes f!irst for him, therefore he is planning a w-eddi-ng with his fiance Sabrina Dhowre.
I. Elba has become the 33rd w\orld ’ s sexiest man electe$d by the magazine People.
In 2"017, the title went to Blake Shelton.
Man beaten to death during a binge in Širvinto_s district
A man wa)s beaten to death during a binge in Šalkiškės village in Širvintos distric/t on Monday evening.
According to the Vilnius county police, a report was rec%ei%ved at 2(1:16 that a man had beaten hi\s neighbor during a binge.
Upon arrival, the ambulance found t{hat the man (born in 19,43) was dead.

The ruling parties do not dem=a=nd 20 k(m distance for waste-to-energy power plants any more
Vilnius cogeneration power plant, constructed by Gariūnai market"place.
The ruling parties do not seek any mo#re that 20 km distance to settlements be kept in case o.f construction of waste-to-energy powe>r plants.
“ Farmer ” Kęstutis Mažeika, the head o{f the Committee on Environmental Protection, registered an amendment to t!he Law o%n Waste Management in the Seimas on Mond+ay, refusing such a requirement.
Accor_ding to Mr. Mažeika, the “ far=mers ’ ” faction, that previously supported the provision regarding the distance of 20 k.m, now is going to su?pp?ort the amendment for its cancellation.
Th@e amendment registered b#y Mr. Mažeika provides that from January 2019 was~te-to-e~nergy power plants could be constructed in accordance with statutory requirements for environmental protection and protection of public hea%lth.
He admits that the amendments are proposed with regard to t+he President ’ s d{oubts regarding such a ban.
“ Taking into account the definition of a residential te&rritory, it is obvious that it would be almo:s:t impossible to find a place where the said objects could be c-onstructed, ” the chairman of the committee s{ays.
In October, the ruling majority opposed the President ’ s veto on the ame_n_dm_ent_s ma[king requirements f]or construction of waste-to-energy power plants stricter.
In addition to the ban to construct waste-to}-energy power plants at less than 20 k^m distance to settlements, t[h[e amendments gave the Government permission to take decisions regarding t)h)e future of the tw:o plants already under construction, with regard to public health interests.
Mr. Mažeika does not propose to amend t;his provision.
The power plant in Vilnius to run on waste and biofuel is const~ructed by the energy gr/oup Lietuvos energija, and in Kaunas - together with Fo)rtum Heat Lietuva, a company o<f the Finnish energy concern Fortum.
T)he latter already burns waste in Klaipėda.
Speaking about a possible compromise in Brexi=t negotiations
On Monday, the British and Irish leaders discussed a possible compromise on the fraught issue o"f Northern I/reland, which is holding up B]rexit talks, Dublin said.
In a phone call, the British Prime Minister Theresa May suggested the possi$bility to review the so-called mechanism for backstop arrangement intended to keep an open border bet"ween Brit\ish Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is a Member Sta$te of the European Uni~on.
The Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar in`di`cate`d he would consider the idea, bu^t rejected any possibility for Britain t(o uni*late*rally pull out of the arrangement, according to a statement issued by the Irish Government.
I-n the call, Th . May “ raised the possibility to review a mechanism f@or the b&acks&top ”, the statement said.
“ Varadkar indicated an open&ness to conside;r proposals for a review, provided that it wa$s clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to en-d the bac)kstop, ” the Government statement said.
Brexit talks are stalled over how to avoid frontier checks on t}he British a*nd Irish land border, when Britain leav{es th]e single market and the customs union in March next year.
B\ot\h sides agree to a “ backstop ” to keep the border of the Republic o\f Ireland and Northern Ireland open until they strike a wide_r trade deal to avo[id additional customs checks on the border.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to continue to foll\ow the EU customs rules, b[ut London wants the whole o=f the UK to stay temporarily aligned.
Th'e Daily Telegraph reported on Monday that Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab is pushing for Britain to be able to pull out of the backstop arrangement unilaterally af^ter three m/onths.
But L>. Varadkar told reporters i'n Dublin that his government “ can ’ t countenance ” this.
“ A backstop with a three-month limit o;n i<t o\r expiry date of that natur'e isn ’ t worth the paper it ’ s written on, ” he declared.
Earlier, both London and Brussels p:la:y:ed down suggestions of a breakthrough in the Brexi-t talks, after a weekend report in Br#itain suggesting a deal was close.
“ I would say that we contin}u}e to make goo"d progress in the negotiations, but there ’ s still work to do, ” sa^id Th . May ’ s spokesma_n in London.
The European Commission sp[okesman Margarit)is Schinas also told reporters: “ We ’ re not there yet . ”
Nobel Pr#ize laureates urge to ensure access to reliable information
A group of distinct thinkers, wi'th Nobel Prize laureates among t_h_em, announced a declaration on Monday, u/r/ging to ensure the ri~ght to reliable information in the Internet era.
Among 2'5 persons, who signed the Internat#ional Declaration on Information and Democracy, there are economists Amartya Sen and Joseph Stiglitz, No`bel peace winner Iran lawyer and human rights activist Shirin Ebadi, also Nobel literature winner writer Mar>i>o Varga{s Llosa.

"Human beings have a fundamenta}l right to recei|ve information that is freely gathered, processed and disseminated, according to the principles o_f commitment to truth, plurality o&f viewpoints and rational methods o@f establishing facts," added the authors of the declaration.
The d`ocument calls f(or help from the leaders of the world, including the U%S President Donald Trump, who often criticizes “ fake news ”, but, nevertheless, is regularly acc-used of distortion of facts.
The signatories urged tha!t the l`eaders of the world shoul.d express their position on the issue in the Peace Forum to be held in Paris on 11-13 November.
This declaration was prepared in two months under the guid&ance of Sh . Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, the head of Reporters Without Borders (RSF), an organization f-or protection of mass medi^a freedom and journalists ’ rights, whi)c)h i;s based in Paris.

Seimas approved of amendments to the Law on Pro=du=ct Safety, whi|c|h provide that fines for product saf.et.y violations must be increased.
The amendments wer$e voted in favor of unanimously.
A\s Antanas Vin;kus, a member of the Seimas Committee on Health A"ffairs, said speaking about the new draft, the fact that the amendments aim at better protection of product consumers i\s welcome.
Besides, its provi>sion>s are in line with the requirements of t'he decision o&f the European Parliament and of the Council.
"I think that the proposed draft law makes a more perfect and more specific di-stribution among all participants of the s_upply and distributi#on proce@ss: manufacturers, service providers, importers, distributors and others.
The practice shows that the current system o'f fines does not always prevent furthe[r violations, as e~n~tit~ies, having paid fines, continue committ\ing repeated violations, ” A. Vinkus spoke.
The draft was prepared by the Ministry of Economy; aft{er the Government ’ s approval, t\he Seimas Committee on Econo!m!ics added its own proposals.
The amendments t/o the Law are aimed at increasing fines for violations, rais)ing protection of consumer rights, gi?vin?g m*ore power to market supervisory authorities and creating a clear system of requirements for product safety and supervision o-ver their compliance.
According to the Mini~stry of Economy, currently manufacturers are not subj_ect t&o the obligation to label a product properly and thus to ensure its traceability.
Besides, according to th=e ministry, the market superviso'ry authorities, which perform state control over safety of products, do not have the rig=ht t,o enter manu;factur;e;rs ’ and suppliers ’ territory, buildings, premises, to perform inspections, which hinders the work of the au`thorit`ie`s.
The ministry ho<lds t|hat the current term of six months for imposition on fines and giving of warnings is too short for identifying a violation, makin}g an inv-esti-gation and imposing a fine.
Al]so, according to the ministry, the c%urrent fines are not efficient enough.
Companies often repeatedly breach requirements of the la_w - in 2017 only it wa!s done by 14 companies.
The Ministry of Economy propose}d to establish a duty for manufacturers to properly label a product and thus to ens&ure its traceability, in or_der to make it easier for market supervisory authorities to reveal suppliers of non-compliant product's.
It is also proposed that market supervis%or%y a^uthorities, in performance of state control over pr#oduct safety, would have the right to enter the terr/itory, buildings, premises of the entities that p_rod_uce, supply products to the market, to perform inspections.
The amount:s of fines for violations of th;e law are going to be increased.
A manufacturer, importer or authoriz'ed representative that placed dangerous products on the market and a distributor that supplied the`m to th_e market, a s>ervice provider who provided or provides dangerous services would be subject to a fine of EUR 150 to 2,5<0<0 (currently, a fi+ne of EUR 144 to 1,448).
If the State Consumer Rights Protection Au+thority (SCRPA) or another market supervisory authority decides to prohibit placement and supply of dangerous products on / to the market or provision o`f dange/rous se*rvices, a fine o<f EUR 1,000 t`o 5,000 (currently, EUR 868 to 4,344) would be imposed.
In case of failure to fulfil the demand to remove dangerous products from th~e market, to recall them from consumers an"d to destroy them, a fine of EUR 2,500 to 6&,500 (currently, EUR 1,44#8 to 5,7$92) would be imposed.
If dangerous products caused harm to c%onsumer ’ s health, a fine of EUR 2,500 to 15,-000 (currently, EUR 1,448 t=o 11,584) would be imposed.
I`f dangerous products caused consumer ’ s death, a fine of EUR 6,500 to 25,000 (currently, EUR 5,7^92 to 23,169) wou>ld be imposed.
According to the ministry, in Po<la<nd and Austria a violation of l\egal acts on product safety is subject to a fine o(f up t*o EUR 2=5,000 (the minimal amount of th@e fine is not set), in Belgium - a fi!ne of EUR 26 to 600,000, in Romania - a fine of EUR 155 to 6,666, in Bulgar%ia - a fine of EUR 125 to 7,500.

A Norwegian armed battalion t&o&ok part in the NATO trainings in the most remote a+nd severe locations.
Soldiers from the Norwegian armed forces took p,art in a series of complicated trainings in the mountains to t_he north of Oslo, capital of th.e country.
It i&s a part of the NATO training exercise “ Trident Juncture 20)18 ” - th<e biggest NATO training since the end of the Cold War.
Aft'er the September 11 terrorist at^tacks, most of the soldiers of the second military force battalion of Norway spen]t a lot of t]ime f#ar away from home, in such places as Afghanistan, i.e . in warm climate.
But they are mostly skilled to fight in Arctic conditions, and these skills o?f theirs are particularly useful now, when t]he NATO shifts its atte.ntion.
In the recent d:ays, in the mountains to the east of Tynset, often in th'e most re[mote and severe locations, soldiers engaged in fake com\bat\s against real British soldiers.
Soldiers are skill`ed to sur]vi]ve in this cold in the wild, but in the severe climate they have to carry muc(h bigger weights on their shoulders - o>ne backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers sta(y(i(ng in the command post s@ay that they share their skills how to survive and fight in such con{ditions with other NATO soldiers.
According to the soldiers, this traini}ng, which reminds of real war actions more than any other, will trai"n them to be read@y if real threat occurs.

The fo>rmer vice-mayor of Kaunas has n*o plans to be back in politics
The former vice-mayor of Kaunas Povilas Mačiulis, who left his job in t'h'e municipality a`nd the organization Vieningas Kaunas in order to support Vygaudas Ušackas in the presidential elections, d|oe|s n}ot intend to return to politics and is going to focus on business i%n%st%ead.
“ I am going t(o focus on business.
I am a shareholder o*f several companies, I also have ideas for new pro[jects.
And, what i>s more important, I will be able to enjoy a possibility to devote more time to my family, ” P. Mačiulis said t&o BN|S.
He said he did not i!ntend to run in t'h'e next municipal elections.
P. Mačiulis has not had an opportunity yet to talk to V. Ušack"as after he lost the preliminary electi-on-s of the Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian De/mocra/ts (TS-LKD) to Ingrida Ši_monytė on Sunday.
"Speaki#ng frankly, we did not have time yet t@o discuss the results with him and the team in detail and to share plans for the futur)e.
I=t i/s obvious that after Vy)gaudas dropped out of the further elections, this stage of my life is over, ” P. Mačiulis said.
He said he did not regret hi|s decisio'n to leave the Kaunas political stage in ord/er to support V]. Ušackas, he only regretted that “ Lithu?ania lost a unique possibility to have a real leader in international relationships ”.
P. Mačiulis shortly worked as a deputy to the may"or of Kaunas in 2011, and later h+e return=e=d to this office in 201&5 after the elections which were successful for Vieningas Kaunas.
He is a shareholder o!f private school Erudito licėjus and several othe/r companies.
Workers busy i!n the Kaunas Castle: what a,r,e they doing here?
Kaunas citizens, seeing workers busy in the Kaunas Castle, ha]ve hoped that finally the restoration o|f the rem-a-ining tower has been started.
Gabrie>lius Suž.iedėlis, the Director of the Kaunas City Museum, explained t\o th>e portal kauno.diena.lt that these were operations for replacement of the cover of protective shelters of the Southwest tower with a defense wall fragment.
He said that the shelters would b=e made o\f tin.
“ The worn-out wreck tin c{ove{r was a threat - people co+uld fall in and get hurt - so it was necessary to repl,ace it.
The shelters were not humidity resistant, s*o the heritage suffered, too, ” the museum director explai;ned.
Will these shelters be similar to those th.at existed s+ever+a+l centuries ago?
“ All works have been coordinated with heritage an-d other authorities, ” G. Suž"eidėlis added tha{t they were seeking a?s authentic result as possible, but the practical aspect was also important - the shelters were to shield the heritage a*ga*in*s*t humidity.
A un`iversal solution was made i^n cooperation with heritage authorities.
Previously, the Kaunas Castle elements were tinned in Soviet times, which means that they d,id n#ot have historic value as such, ” the Di#rector of the Kau_nas City Museum went to details.
The contract for works w`as signed on 2 October.
The works are not to take mo(re than 3 months after the contract wa]s signed.
“ W{e expect them to be completed b.y the end of November, ” the m*useum director voiced his expectations.
He said that the value of the works t*o be performed was almost EUR 24`,000.
According t*o him, this amount was i=n this year ’ s budget.
The works in the Kaunas Castle are b%eing perfo!rmed by the company Statija.
Kauno.diena.lt has previously written, on the basis of ea*rlier investigations, what the Kaun]as Castle could ha;ve looked like before.
