Long ago our ment!or Askar Tokpanov: I have s[een you speaking on TV.
Not b^ad.
Dee@pe@n your mind, read Abay, do not g^et distracted.

This grain elevator was left from the Soviet Union period, it w-as the object nobody nee.ded in 90s.
It was recovered by "Elevator Agrofood" company as much a?s th.ey can, now it stores, sells high-qual/i/ty wheat with an adhesive capacity of 30 turn!s growing in Torgay district.
China on one side, Arabs o@n th\e other side, and Russia nearby express their in#terest in our Torgay district wheat.
We will soon inst?all German powerful mill grinding 70 tons o/f flour per day, then we will give job for 10-15 more peop|le.
We thin@k that we will be ab)le to raise the salary more.
Today, 22 people work at the g(rain elevator.
Among them, we have given 5-6 people earning 32-33 th*ousand tenge per month a rai@se.
This is a bas#e wage only.
Work in agriculture is not given by time, sometimes when i`t is needed to perform additio*n*a*l works extr+a charge per hour is paid, - execu$tive director of grain elevator Kurman Abdrakhman says.
"Elevator Agrofood" Limited Liability Partn<ership has taken a ply towards further development of high-quality storag&e and processing of durum wh:eat.
Now oa/t is being purified and sorted to sh+ip it to Iran.
The task of the Head o/f the State i}s completed implicitly.
Why are we working, if w"e do not develop the economy and cannot be useful f;or the c<oun<try?
This sh&ould be every entrepreneur's debt, - Kurman Tu/rga/n/ul/y says.
Ambitious i>n business entrepreneur also keeps his word.
Go|rge|ous celebration in all th\e cities an(d residential areas o_f Kazakhstan of the 100th anniversary of bloodthirsty red butchers of Leninist Komsomol is a shame for our country, brothers.
This, fir}st of all, means Komsomols' slap in the face of t{he Independence of the K+azakh Country.
Yesterday the information about t]he great celebration of the 100th anniversary of red butchers trying their best by the initiators, heads of former Komsomol, followers initiated by to/day's red butc#hers Nurlan Omarov in Sem:ey, the birthplace of `~` Alashorda ')' standing at the origins of Kazakh statehood was released.
I wa,s surprised t+o see pioneers wearing a red tie on the Internet in Kazakhstan schools.
Now having seen thes{e Russified, i.e . sl~aves with no origin started to poison openly the conscious of Kazakh young gene|ratio|n I found nothing to say...Wha~t a horror!
How can we understand t#his Komsomol's backt.rack from the Independence of Kazakh Country, saying w`e are Russian slaves?
Oh, horror, sla*ve's name i)s a slave!
We nee*d to understand that recognition by those Tas}magambetov, Ai*timova, Sultanov in fact that they are colonizer#s' slaves, open expression of their endless l/ove towards Russia i&s an open recognition of the dependence of today's followers of yesterday red butchers first of all to Russia which we thought to be vanished into thin ai^r up to date.
In 198.6, I still remember dishonest actions of th;ose current "forever deputies": K.Sultanov, B.Aitimova during famous Decembe{r ev.ents in 1986 dished on D.Konayev who helped them raise in their care{ers to Gennady Kolbin, grieving and crying, no?w the'y told about those participating in December events: "C:omrade Kolbin, I will bring those bitches you to punish them", and I was the one to write about this grief i.n my epos "Zobalan" (Outrage$s), during the Soviet Empire, in particular, in 1990, made one-hour long radio p&lay in Munich, and I am the author o)f the famous writing traveling the w=orld, akyn Zhumash Kokbori!
The K$azakh nation also did n.ot forget who involuntarily quietened down at that time!
As the citizen of Inde"pendent Kazakhstan, as the child of the Kazakh nation, I will accuse open~ly the followers of t%hose red butchers!
If our country is independent indeed, I will openly talk that the day born to punish them as the state betrayers constituting a threat op;e;n;ly to th:e Independence of Kazakhstan o#f forever president of this count\ry a's the whole people!
"M<y nation, my Kazakh, m<y poor people '>' (Abay), it is the moment to openly punish these red butcher Komsomo_l as the whole nation.
Wake up, K[azakhs, history will never forgive your next qui:e:sce:nc:y.
Never forget this, Kazak[hs!
India set out to clear th?e air.

A few days ago in Almaty, a Turkish citizen beat the ambulance driver i=n the m,idd,le of the street and in,f,licted significant harm to his health.
Later on, despite the police had caught the foreigner, t)he pros'ecu'tors released him against acknowledgment.
It was said t!hat prejudicial investigative action#s are taken place concerning this case now.

Thus, he is bre*aking articles 295 and 296 of t(h(e Criminal Cod\e of RoK, - was written in the statement on the complainant's part.
The investigator also seems not t=o acce*pt the statement of claim.
I will not accept y~our appeal.
Submit it to the clerical office of the AI'A.
But it is Saturday, it does not work, - s:aid the investigator t'o th-e complainant and his lawyer.
Why is t.he investigato'r using the best endeavors not to schedule an additional inspection to determine the level of the harm inflicted to the complainant '&s health?

Arkhimed Mukhambetov about changing Kostanay re(gio(n into Torgay.
Akim o}f Kostanay region Arkhimed Mambetov expressed his opinion concerning the initiative a>bout naming Kostanay region as Torgay region.
Today the question concerning an open letter about changing the name of the region o+f the ini^tiati^ve group has been put at the briefing h*eld in Astana.
I ha^ve familiarized myself with the letter.
I have seen i&t.
In general, I am agai{nst it.
Because Kostanay region has its own name fr'om history.
If I am not mistaken, 17 people sig|ned this lett&er.
I know a few p@eople.
When I talked to them in person, Sabyrzhan Akhmetuly wh(o was akim in m{any distri*ct*s refused it saying "I have not signed this letter".
Kalibek Deripsaldin (composer) said that he also had n$o$t signed t%his letter.
For this reason, I believe that dist{urbing people is not correct, - Arkhimed Mukhambetov s^ai^d.
The regional akim reminded tha|t t]here i{s an order of changing the name of the residential area, and hearings must be held.
So, w\e will see.
B}ut, in general, there is my viewpoint.
W#e have the center of the district formed wit+h Torgay name, coming from long since.
If in 30s, 40s the name of Kost.anay city was Torgay, then the works on retu"rning the previous name w;ould be reasonable.
But I am against i<t, i)t is my viewpoint - Arkhimed Mukhambetov concluded.

Furthermore / Alongside this, the Prime-Minister drew the attention o,f the Government members to a number o[f the k#ey aspects.

The second one is t-h-e issue of provision of construction sites with engineering / utility syst#ems.

This year, about half o)f the budget funds allocated for the implementation o'f the State program are foreseen f&or this course.
Besides, B.Sagintayev said t"hat construction of ready-built residential houses failed to be put into operation due to the lack of t|he required infrastructure in some regi(ons.

Th%erefore, regional aki@ms were instructed to supervise strictly this issue and provide the implementation of the task within the next tw>o months.
