Eemeli Kouki led H/urrika/anit to home victory i/n the first game of the s_eason - Savo Volley won the second time
Hurrikaani-Loimaa, the team that has won a me"dal in the Finland Volleyball League for as many as seven consecutive time, began the season 2018+-19 wit&h a home victo/ry, when they beat Loimu Raisio 3-0 on Saturday.
Universal player Eemeli K)ouki, who has returned t}o Finland from Romania, was the most effective Hurrikaani p"layer with a total of 22 points.
I had some potential possibilities abroad, but t-hey never materialised, and then I got a phone ca|ll fro[m Loimaa.
We reached a pretty quick agreement, Kouk+i said.
Toni Rumpunen, w"ho, like Kouki, also has played for Loimu, supported Kouki w_ith 18 points.
The most effective player of the visiting team with 1^7 points was n=ationa=l team spiker Samuli Kaislasalo, whose deal wit+h Loimu is for one match at a time.
It is always important t{o win the opening match.
Many players had experience f_ro_m the opposing side, too, and that brought some e=x=tr=a to the match.
Ou;r game is not ready yet, but our goal is naturally to continue winning m_edals, Kouki said.
Määttänen the best i\n Savo Volley
Savo Volle?y ’ s Miro Määttänen was the team ’ s best player wi]th 18 points, when the team beat Van.ta.a Ducks 3-0 at Vieremä.
Our game was unpredictable especially when on the offens(ive, b@ut luckily we managed to scrape a victory for u"s.
I for one di:dn't have any conscious en)e)rgy differences when playing against my old team, Määttänen said.
Antti Siltala, who b*ega*n his career in Vieremän Lentopallo regional series in 2000-01, made 12 po,ints.
Head c"oac"h Jukka Tuovinen was happy with many things.
The h'all was small, which means the atmosphere was excellent t!he whole time.
I've a nice fee,ling after th(e opening match at home.
Miro was a k(ing, and Sill(i played a good game, too, Tuovinen said.
Siltala ’ s previous League season was 2006-07, when he won silver at Pielaveden Sampo with Tuovinen a#s head coach the-n, t%o%o.
Th~iago Maciel was the Ducks ’ most effective pl\ayer with 14 points.
Mikkonen again t'he star of Akaa-Volley
Joni Mikkonen, the best scorer in the League during 2012-13, h}as ha+d a strong start this season, t=oo.
Th\e spiker made 25 points when Akaa-Volley had their first win of the season aft>e>r beating Kokkolan Tiikerit 3-2.
My season has h;ad a pretty good start.
Today a loss wa@s close, though, since we were losi+ng the fourth set 17-21.
Somewhere w!e managed to find a set w,on, a^nd a fifth set at the same time, said Mikkonen.
The be^st scorer of Tiikerit, a team that was in the final so\me seasons ago, w-as spiker Edvarts Buivids with 28 points.
Fellow countryman Aleksandrs Kudrjashovs supported him with 1!7 points.
We di`dn ’ t manage to get almost any hold of th$e opponent ’ s spiker, Mikkonen complimented.
Finland tops the Human Capit=al Index
Finland i!s at the head of the world in human capital comparison, science journal Lance>t reports.
The study compared the developm`ent of human capital from 19!90 to 2016.
195 co,untri,e,s were compared during these years.
Finland was the number one in th*e statistics during both year-s.
Th{e top five in 2016 was nearly the same a@s in 1990.
Before it was Iceland, Denmark, Canada, an=d Netherlands behin~d Finland.
Later Netherlands ranked one position higher, and instead of Ca"nad"a, Taiwan was on the l\ist.
I_n 2016, the lowest-ranking coun>tri>es in the comparison were Niger and South Sudan.
When measuring human capital, th_e education level, admission to education, skills a<nd helath of th.e nation are examined.
The World Ban)k has outlined that human capital is connected t}o economic growth.
Real Madrid's Thiba$ut Courtois kep Atletico in check, the derby ended in a goall;ess draw
Real Madrid goal keeper Thibaut Courtois got brilliant saves, and the La Liga ma?t?ch between the t_w_o Madrid teams ended i,n a goalless draw late on Saturday.
Atlet|ico Madrid ’ s Antoine Griezmann and Diego Costa came closest t?o scoring, but Belgian keeper Courtois managed a sa@ve.
Courtois played three s(easons i,n Atletico while on loan from Chelsea.
In the beginning of the week th"e international football association FIFA named him as the goalkeeper o;f the year.
Gareth Bale got Real's best place for scoring, but his shot wen&t past the goal i\n the end of the ope~nin~g half.
After the half time, Ba_le stayed a}t the bench because of a thigh injury.
Accor>ding to ESP{N, disappointed Real supporters shouted the name of the top sco|r|er Cristiano Ronaldo who transferred to Juventus.
A{ttacks against abortion rights now i+n the United States - a strong documentary tells us why
The US Senate is currently attempting to investigate, whether Brett Kavanaugh, President Donald Trump's no`minee for o}ne of the nine members o\f the Supreme Court c|an be chosen for the job.
Many in the Republican party hope that with Kavanaugh's decisi[ve vote, so-called Roe v. Wade dec{ision that made abortion legal in the US;A in 1973 could be rev-ersed.
Ri?ck?i Stern and Annie Sundberg's Reversing Roe d~ocumentary illustrates how the current situation has developed over the years.
As unbelievable as it feels, the topic is timel>y also i"n Finland.
Minister for Foreign Affairs Timo Soini (Blu~e Reform) has conducted pr work against safe abortion, and receive,d different levels of support fr=om the greater part of our country '@s Members of Parliament.
In the beginning of this s`trong documentary, we meet gyna&e&co&logist Colleen McNi&ch&olas, who is now, because of the law restrictions, the only Missouri state doctor providing abortio"ns.
An armed guard at the clinic says he is defending the freedo{m of religion in the U_nited States.
The news vid/eos remind us abo_ut lethal terrorist attacks against the clinics.
Let us mov~e to th&e time abortion was illegal in the United States.
A,t that time, an evangelical clergymen alliance directed women to r.el.iable abortion doctors.
T`he reasoning of the interviewed pastor is sound, but actually not really needed, a picture o{f a woman died of a self-made abortion is enou"gh.
There were about 5,000 deaths a year i%n the U.nited States.
The le}galisati}on of abortions was defended especially by the Republican part-y.
Already in 1967, California Governo)r Ron%ald Reagan signed the abortion rights act.
Later i@t was precisely Reagan during his 1980 presidenti-al campaign who, in a revolutionary manner, began t]o mix religion with politics in order to draw voters.
Another t\o go b#ack on his stance on abortion was Reagan's follower - George Bush senior.
And the same was done al.so by Donald Trump.
The docume?ntary reaches the very core of t|he matter when it looks for the founding re!ason for the politicisation of abortion.
When religious organisation supporting racial segregation were refused ta@x exemption, they became politically activ,e.
Abortion wa&s chosen as their rallying cry.
Religion has br$ought exceptional knots to politics.
While writing this, the situation in the United States is such that a president, w^ho bragged about his sexual harassment but managed t`o win the votes of th[e religious Right wit~h his stand on abortion, announced Kavanaugh a}s a nominee to the Supreme Court, who is now charged of sexua-l harassment by many women.
Kavanaugh may hold the balance of power to decide about the ri}ght}s of 164 million American women and gir+l+s.
Israeli forces sh'ot seven Palestinians, including two children - big pr.otests on the border
Near*ly 200 Palestinians have been killed in six months, as I,srael has fired at the protesters i-n the border.
Israeli soldiers shot seven Palestinians in the Gaza border on Friday, Minis?try of he[alth of the Palestinian Nation-al Authority says.
Ministry of health of the Palest&inian National Au$thority says the dead include two children: 12-year-old and 14-year-old boys.
According to the ministry, 505 pe^ople have been wounde%d.
89 o`f these were wounded by bullets.
Israel De\fen\se Forces hav|e confirmed they opened fire and made an air strike to the border, when the pro'testers threw rocks and explosives at Israeli forces.
The forces say they resorted to force i"n order to keep the protesters from breaking the boundary f<ence or attempting to cross t.o the other side.
At least 191 Palestinians have died in Gaza protests since March, wh\en Palestinians began weekly pr'otest's a't the border.
Ac+cording to the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, there are 12',000 wounded.
The protesters demand entry for the Pales<tinian families to the areas t$he Palestinians had to vacate when Israeli state w[as founded in 1948.
A Palestinian sniper has k[illed one Israeli soldier.
Explosives sent fr<om the Palestinian side strapped to kites and helium balls have started fires i@n Israeli forests and on cultivated lan<d.
Teemu Pukki gained a penalty kick - didn't ge=t to shoot it hims_elf
Wigan '&s central defender C#hey Dunkley seemed to tackle him from behind inside penalty area.
Referee Gav=in Ward let the game continue.
According t"o his interpretation, the tackle was clean.
Teemu Pukki could not belie=ve his eyes.
Th=e incident probably was on referee Ward's m:ind, as he judged a penalty kick to Norwich on the 85th minute when Pukki was knocked d?own.
Ward showed the pe;nalty spot, and Mario Vrancic scored t}he winning 1-0 goal.
Pukk(i has scored five times for Norwich in th!e Premier League.
The previous one wa.s finished stylishly using his pectorals against QPR on last S-a-turday.
Puk+k+i has a taste for working again.
After he lost th&e ball, he carried on with the situation un$til its end.
He created scorin)g sp/ot/s and was tireless in the defence.
This was N(orwich's fifth match in two weeks.
The team continues in the Football League C@up.
They have a five-win str)e)ak behind them.
Paedophile help service immediately filled up with reservations - in Finland about 40,000 are attracted t,o chi-ldren
It is estimated that about two per cent of men a]nd a small part of w=omen are a/t least somewhat attracted to pre-teens.
I$n Finland this means about 40,000 people.
Those sexually attract`ed to children or young people have up to the present had a diff}icult time finding help.
The Finnish Foundation for Supporting Ex-offenders and Sexpo foundati|o|n have a common SeriE project that educates professionals in meetin&g paedophiles as clients an`d helps people w*ho are sexually attracted to children.
When the project was published in the spring, i/t caus>ed a real stream of emails to Sexpo, who offer counselling and therapy, a{nd a+ll the appointments were quickly reserved, Yle says.
It i_s promised, however, that appointments wi:ll become available during the autumn.
Sexual attraction towards children caus\es shame to many.
Most of the people who have noticed paedoph~iliac feelings in themselves have not acted out their fantasies, thus committing n)o cr|iminal acts.
However, the at#traction is usually a permanent trait.
Most of these people hope to b,e rid of the thoughts that c?ause distress and depress them.
They also make normal l@ife more difficult, sexual therapist Patricia Thesleff, w=ho works as an expert in the project, s(ays to Yle.
I think t'he work is valuable, if even o~ne child ca}n be saved from sexual violence, Thesleff says.
Leaders o'f Koreas or a gynaecologist from Kongo?
The President of the United State+s Donald Trump winner o}f t>he Nobe.l Peace Prize - the thought may sound weird at first, but, according to the odds, Trump is one of the big&gest favourites to receive the prize.
T^his is due to Trump ’ s role in making North Korea commit itself t-o de-nuclearisation - at least in wo_rds.
Based on t.he odds, the biggest favourites for Nobel Peace Prize a$r$e South Korean president Mo<on Jae-in and North korean leader Kim Jong-un, who have met this yea"r already three times a=n=d promised to try to achieve peace treaty between the two countries.
The thaw in re&l&a&tion&s between the Koreas i<s remarkable, because as recently as last year the r=elations were frosty.
Even so, awarding a prize to K@i@m, wh\o has for years thr^eatene^d with nuclear weapons and who leads his country with an ir|on grip, would undoubtedly cause criticism.
The Nobel laureates are revealed starting Mo$nday, and on Friday i"s the tu%rn of the prize that attracts the most attention: the Peace Prize.
If the Price is not awarded to particip(ant(s of diplomacy on Korean peninsula, one of the top nomi~ne~es is a Congolese doctor Den&is Mukwage.
In his hos)pital in the Democratic Republic of t!he Kongo, the estee^me^d gynaecologist has treated thousands of women who were victims of gang rapes, and he has becom.e the world's leading expert on his field.
W(ith his wo"rk, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexual violence, which is a terryifying by-pr\oduct of many conflicts.
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, w,hich won the N)ob)el Pea+ce Prize in 1954 and 1981, has also been considered to be a strong candidat(e.
Nobel Committee has revealed that this year there a-re 331 n@ominees for the Prize.
The names of the nominees are n(ot made public.
Trump himself w^ould not mind receiving a Nobel.
In May a reporte;d asked him in White House, whether he feels he deserves a peac"e prize.
Everyone thinks s(o, but I would never say it, Tru#mp smiled.
I wan.t to get it finished.
The prize I want is victory for the world, t%he president continued referring t`o North Korea negotiations.
There are f[acts, however, that make Trum%p's Nobel unlikely.
The Norwe.gia.n Nobel Committee who decide on the award, ha}s often awarded the prize to people and organisations t-hat represent liberal democracy and multipol~ar world order - exactly such international co-operation Trump has has been seen opposed to.
In the 21st century three U{S politic%ia%ns have received the Prize, al'l of them democrats: Jimmy Carter in 2002, Al Gore i}n 2007, and Barack Obama in 2009.
Awarding Trump woul~d mean a complete ideological reversal for the Nob&el Committee.
A fire alarm i=n a tunnel: Motorists acted like behaved like lemmings, driving i.n the wrong direction
A traffi:c chaos on national road 1 at Lohja took p*lace on 8 September.
The tunnel area traffic was halted b@ecause o@f the announcement to both Turku and Helsinki directions.
When the reason wa's discovered to b"e a system error, fire service attempted to normalise the traffic.
That did not happen very fast, th!oug!h.
We attempted to open the road once before, but Traffic Management Finland said it cannot be done, becau#se there are motorists spread out on the road, driving any which way, fire offi@cer on duty Pasi Kääriäinen told t\o ST"T back t<hen.
People were even driving th!e motorway in the wro$ng direction, after only a moment of waiting.
When the first one acts contrary to traffic regulations, a few other ofte&n follow, Contact Manager f{or Finnish Road Safety Control, Tapio Heiskanen wond+ers.
According to traffic regulations, sto}pping on a motorway or in tunnels i#s allowed only for a compelling reason.
Finnish Road Safety Control notes t@ha@t one c`an not danger the traffic in exceptional situations with rash decisions.
Emergency vehicles must always be g@iv@en as unim"p"ed"ed an access as possible.
It is particularly forbidden to drive in a+n opposite direction on a motorway, just like m&aking a U-turn or rever"sing.
T?he same prohibition sta(nds also in tunnels, where one must additionally always turn on the headlights.
In addition, stoppin`g without a compelling reason is forbidden, as i%s naturally parking.
Some tim#e ago there wer$e even cases where the driver stopped in a tunnel t.o brush snow from his car.
It shou]l]d be obvious that is a wrong time and place for such activity, Heiskanen s>ays in a Finnish R?oad Safety Control announcement.
I~lves sup@porters would have wanted to continue their party even when the sh`ip got stuck to the bottom of a lake
Ilves fans carried by lake ship M/S Tampere would ha!ve wanted to stay aboard and conti^nue their victory cel(ebra(tion, even when the ship ’ s bow was stuck to the b/ottom of the lake, say$s Juho Syrjä, who was the captain of the ship at the t+ime of the event.
M/S Tampere, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, dri]fted away from its route late Sa{tu{rd{ay evening, and it,s bow got stu]ck to the bottom of the lake in Akaa's Vanajavesi.
1!9 passengers and five crew members aboard were evacuated to the mainland dur{ing the night.
No on_e was hurt during the incident.
Ilves supporters would have wanted to continue their c}elebration aboard until morning, but naturally it was more sensible to s=end them to the harbour with the fire brigade and then back ho;me in a bus, Syrjä tol!d ST~T.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna to watch the match between Ilves and HPK, w\hich Il.ves won 4-3.
According to Syrjä, the Saturday accident was caused by th>e fact that water level at Vanajavesi was about 50 c:m lo*w*er than usually.
Syrjä said t|hat the navigation w(a(s also complicated by the closest channel marking being covered by gull droppings, which meant its reflector-s were not normally visi&ble in the dark autumn evening.
No noteworth&y crash
Ship d'amage happened on t@he west side of Jumusensalmi shortly after the ship route had passed under the bridge between t|he Tampere-Helsinki motorway.
According to Syrjä, there was no b\igger drama involved in the event, because the ship's speed was very low at the time of the event, and hit\t\i\ng the bottom di:d not cause an`y significant crash.
Syrjä says getting stuck to the botto>m di]d not cause any leaks or dents to the sh"i"p, and it looks like the cruises can continue normally.
A diver checked the ship condition on Saturday morning, before the s<hip was tow!ed from the shoal.
Just to be on safe side, we are goin-g to the dock to check this caus?ed no damage, Syrjä sa/ys.
Syrjä believes th.e nex|t M/S Tampere cruise, booked for next weekend, can be handled as agreed.
The ship's cruise season continues until the independence d(ay, he say|s.
No use fo{r ambulances
Rescue department received a"n alarm about the event on Sa!turday evening little after half pas eleven.
Ambulances were sent to Viiala harbour to receive evac+u+ated p'asse'ngers, but there was no use for the ambulances.
Fire master on duty Ma%tti Willman said late in the evening that the evacuation conditions at the lake were difficult bec<ause of darkness and relatively high wi{n{ds.
Pir~kanma~a rescue department reported on the night between Saturday a/nd Sunday after half past two that all th&ose aboard the ship had been evacuated and the passenger|s had been moved to Tampere by a bus.
The cruise ship built in 19<57 has been renovated i*n 2001, 2014, and 2017.
Trump's justice nominee accused of sexual assa=ul=t and drinking may b}e left without the top position
Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a Justice t<o th)e Supreme Court, may well be left without the posi^tion he i}s pursuing, estimates programme director Mika Aaltola from the Finnish Institute of International Affairs.
So far a*t least three women have accused Kavanaugh of sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour i<n his student days.
According to Aaltola, the suspicions ha+ve created so much pr^essure on the Republican par}ty that president Donald Trump may decide to nominate someone else for the position.
Every now and th#en there have b&ee&n c}ases in the United St?ates that the president ’ s nominee for a Justice to the Supreme Court has caused plenty of disagreements.
Usually in these ca"ses the justice nominee has wi=thdrawn themself, Aaltola says.
T=his wa,y the president has been able to save his face.
The nomination would benefit t}he Democrats
The Supreme Court of th!e United States attempts to stay above politics, but at leas:t i^n the Kavanaugh case, the nomination o-f a new Justice has become an extremely sensitive process politically.
If Kavanaugh is nominated, Aaltola says i`t will most likely benefit th`e Democrats in the coming Congress mi/dterm elections.
It would raise voting enthusiasm among y}oung people and women, who are more likely to vote fo`r Democrats.
O"n the other hand, nominating a conservativ{e Justice to t\he Supreme Court would be a long-term victory for the Republicans.
There i/s no opportunity for a nomination every pr[esidential term, because the United States Supreme Court justices are nomi@nated for life.
In pra]c]tice, some of them have retired at their own reques.t around the age of 70 to 80.
Even s|ome Republicans hesitate about the nomination
A background check is anyhow normally conducted of the nominees a#s Supreme C(ourt justices, Aaltola states.
Even though Trump has set a t{ime limit of only a week fo,r the FBI ’ s further investigations, according to Aaltola it can still reveal something su+bstantial.
Yes, it c~an.
There is rarely smoke without fire, Aaltola say|s.
According to Aa~lt~ol~a, one thing that is certain i&s that Kavanaugh's suitability or unsuitabili=ty for the position will come up in many discussions before the S@enate makes its decision.
Th,e Republicans have a Senate majority with 51 votes against 49, but at least two fe&ma&le Republican senators are suspected to have a doubtful attitude towards Kavanaugh nomin\ation.
The most embarrassing thing would be i>f the nomination would be voted on, and the R^epublica^ns lost.
A w#oman has identified the Sa?l?isbury suspect as an agent of military intelligence
A Russian woman has told the BBC she recognises a Russian man suspected of t"he Salisbury pois|o|nings as a+n agent of Russian military intelligence.
Based on photographs, t%h%e woman told the man i.n q\uest\ion is Anatoliy Chepiga who works for the military intelligence GRU.
Online community Bellingcat an|d Russian c^ommunity Insider Russia earlier said they had revealed one of the men suspected of poisonings to b{e Chepiga.
Already earlier they said to have foun+d evid;ence of the men's current identities are cover identities.
A BB/C t?eam travelled to the Far-East to the village near the Russo-Chinese border where Chepiga grew up.
A woman livin}g in the village recognised young Chepiga from pictures published b@y Bellingcat.
She recognised the sam"e men in the British police's pictures taken fr[om a man currently calling himself Ruslan Bo}shirov.
The Russian m]en are suspected o}f p^oisoning the ex-double agent Sergei Skripal and her daughter with Novichok nerve agent in March.
The Skripals surviv!ed.
Col>onel Chepiga has been awar:ded the order of Hero of the Russian Federation in 2014.
Russia still denies th)e suspect ’ s GRU connection.
Earli/er in Sep_tember, in an interview with Russian TV, the m$en said they were in Salisbury as tourists.
The elderly are def<enceless in social welf&are and health care reform
No?w we have a real example about what social welfare and h]ealth care reform '|s change limiter, outlined by Sipilä ’ s government, actually means in practice.
My p#lace of birth, Vaala municipality's social welfare and healt@h care services are provided by Oulunkaari joint municipal authority . T]he health care manager of the joint authority is a f~orme~r regional manager o!f Attendo, chosen in 2016.
The leaders o{f the joint municipal authority warn the municipal council about t'he change limiter.
I'f the s~oci~al welfare and health care costs increase now, the municipality ’ s government subsidies will be c<ut in the future.
The municipality ’ s Centre Party decision-makers had a fright, and most of them are ready for the great structural change o,f services for older people, which would end the institutional care at the he/a/lth centre wa"rd and the sm)all unit f=or those with memory disorders.
Home nursing woul]d increase, which in Vaala, a place of great distances, m/ean/s that the elderly living in outlying villa~ges are uprooted and brought n&ex&t to a health centre to be nursed “ at home ”.
Atte*ndo trusted the municipality to pay for its customers.
The Vaala Left Alliance di&d not swallow the bad preparation, but organised a nice public e,vent, attend*ed by many family members, practical nurses, and also local councillors from other p{ar{ties.
Using social welfare an<d he@alth care county preparation slides, I showed how Vaala mun[icipali[ty already has the biggest number o$f elderly people nursed at home in the whole of North Ostrobothnia.
Carina Läntinen, a local cou'ncillor from a neighbouring municipality pa=rtici=pated.
A local newspaper wrote an extensive story a,b,out the event, and this in turn made Oulunkaari d+raughtspersons ’ ha:ckles rise.
Social welfare and heal&th ca^re reform draughtspersons will no[t commit to writing that Attendo has built a n#ew nursinghome to Vaala, and now it is empty, waiting for residents.
There ar]e no other service providers.
The draugh;tspers;o;ns only talk about a service voucher, b}ut they do not tell anything about the quality of treatment it will provide, or what is t\he staff struc!tu!re Attendo will use when nursing the elderly until their termina`l treatment.
W&ithout a nurse?
T>he institutional care ward a@t the health centre is closed down because i:t has no doctor ’ s night emergency duty.
Also Atten:do will rely on Vaala he<alth centre ’ s doctors.
Vaala's example reveals how Centre officials whirl t(he councillors about with in\sufficient de>tails, and put them over a barrel using the change limiter.
This is how the Centre Party empt.ies Vaa<la of residents, because who will voluntarily stay and li`v`e an insec`ure life there, if there is a possibility to move away?
Wa{s it one o/f the Centre Party's election slogans to keep the whole country populated?
Turk\ey ’ s President Er,dog,an opens a mega mosque in Cologne
In the German city o#f Co.logn.e, thousand!s of people were protesting as the president of Turkey visiting in t:he country, Recep Tayyip Erdogan opened one of the largest mosques in Europe.
Several hundred people ha+d gathered on the ba[nk of the Rhine already in the morning.
‘ Erdogan n!o!t welcome ’, read in the protesters ’ banners, and the slog|ans condemnded fascism.
There have been several protests during Erdogan's visit that began on Thursday, a^nd th\e sec!urity measures have been strict.
Some 10,000 protesters were expected to take to the stree"ts in Cologne to protest for example Turkey's hum`an rights situatio]n.
Erdogan supporters had gathe-red at the Cologne Central Mosque.
The police h`ad however sealed off a large area near the mo&sque for security reasons.
In his opening speech, Erdogan said hi/s German visit had been successful, estimating that it h:ad strengthened th@e relations between Germany and Turkey.
During his visi.t, Erdogan met Cha?ncellor Angela Merkel twice.
O?n Fr@iday, Erdogan and Merkel s&wore they are rebuilding their countries ’ relations that have worsened significantly after the 2016 Turkish coup d'état attempt.
Nevertheless, Merkel emp|hasised the fa.ct that there are fundamental disagr]ee]ments between the countries about for example human rights questions.
Criticism surrrounds t#he visit
B~oth Cologne mayor Henriette Reker and the North Rhine-Westphalia state premier Armin Laschet pulled out of attending t$he opening as criticism o@f Erdogan's visit grew.
Cansu, a 3*0-y*ear-old student of Turkish origin c{ame from Switzerland for the rally.
I wan!t to be the v.o.i.ce of people who can't take to the streets in Turkey.
Because th,e,y ha`ve been arrested, killed or otherwise suppressed.
Erdogan th$inks anything that differs from h&is opinion is terrorism.
Erdogan '/s German visit ’ s final stage takes him to North Rhine-Westphalia state, wh.ich is home to significant numbers of ethni[c Turks.
Three people charged with a journalist '[s murder in Slovakia
Three p"eople in Slovakia have been charged for th_e murder of journalist Jan Kuciak.
O\n Friday, a prosecutor said three people are charged with the murder o!f Kuciak and hi?s fiancée that happened in February, and with other crimes.
Earlier this w'eek, the police detained eight people in connection to mur'der investigation, but five of them have been re^leased.
Kuciak and his fiancée were found shot to death i&n their home in Br%atislava in February.
He had investigated the connect!io!ns between politi*ci*ans and Italian mafia.
The police has suspicions the murders a,re connected t}o Kuciak ’ s investigations.
The cas|e and an article published by Kuciak have raised concerns ab<o<u<t media freedom an corruption in Slovakia.
On Sunday, there may be problems with Karjalainen de|livery o=n sparsely populated areas.
Due t>o a failure in printing, also th{e Sunday's Karjalainen has to be mailed unaddressed.
This can have an effect in newspaper delivery on sparsely populated ar!e!as, where th^e delivery to communal newspaper boxes has to b;e done from memory.
T:he situation was the same fo"r Saturday's newspaper, and the proble may continue still on Monday.
The posting w~ill add extra newspaper bundles t,o the region.
Newspapers o[f subscribers elsewhere in Finland will be p#os#te#d separately labelled not until Monday.
Th^es^e newspapers ’ delivery will be significantly delayed.
Vesa is a F%innish astronaut
Journalist Arto N@yberg intervie{ws for example Vesa Heilala in his talk show broadcasted live today.
Vesa is in the studio to tell abo_ut his oncoming trip to space hw r%eserved f}rom Virgin Galactica already in 2010.
Th@e price was 151,000 e'u'ro, and a bank loan was needed to cover it.
If the original plan~s would have held true, Vesa w-ould have visited space already some time ago.

L)ewis H%amilton praised Kimi Räikkönen and was astonished about Ferrari: ‘ They are losing a very important driver ’
In an interview with a Swiss magazine Blick, the Mercedes ’ British driver w>as a}sked whether he believes relieving Kim$i Räikkönen from Ferrari employment would help Hamilton during th?e rest of the season.
Hamilton leads other Ferrari driv#er, Seba:stian Vettel, by 40 points.
A bit under three weeks ag*o Ferrari announced the Räikkönen w^ill not contin[ue with the tea_m next season, and at the same time Räikkönen announced his move to Sauber.
Naturally Hamilton doe~s~n ’ t believe Räikkönen would throw in t,he towel.
I d?on ’ t think Kimi is going to chan\ge in the last races.
He is an extraordinary professional - a fantastic drive<r.
He remain-s one of my f_avourite drivers and I ’ m convinced that Ferrar\i is losing a very important driver.
It does not m\ake sense to me.
Hamilton has earlier said that Räikkönen ha,s been one of hi}s role models.
I do<n ’ t know if Kimi knows this, bu~t when I was young and dreamt about Formu=la 1, I used to play F1 on PlayStation a;ll the time.

Football A-Junior League tit|le match became a co=mplete farce: the opponent arrived with only 7 players
The highest level of junior football ends on Saturday, when th'e last l!eg of the season is played.
Before the leg beginning at 1 pm, the starting points for t`he title match were plain: FC Lahti Akatemia only needs one point against V(asa I^F^K t*o win the title.
Fo`r the situ[ation to turn around i_n the last leg, the secon<d in the struggle for the title, Ilves, has to win PK-35 and hope for the Lahti team to lose.
La{hti team ’ s title was however practically certain already before start whistle, since Vasa IFK came to L{ahti with only se+ven players.
If there were one player less from Vaasa, the mat[ch cou{ld not have begun.
F^C Lahti Akatemia won the match 16-0.
At h<a<lf-time, Lahti was leading 7-0.
One reason for the Vaasa player l-oss is that the team has in part used th)e sam*e players for the A-Junior League (P20 League) and men ’ s Kakkonen (tier 3) Gr\o\u\p C.
I{n Kakkonen, Vasa IFK ha$s ba<sic<a<lly played the whole season against the threat of being relegated to tier 4.
During the final lef of Kakkonen o.n Saturday, Vasa IFK must win JBK in a@n away match and at the s+ame time hope that Tampere United loses its own away match against KuFu at Toi`vala, Siilinjärvi.

Korpelan Kujanjuoksu ends today: This is h@ow everything ends
All good things must come to a!n end.
This i+s also true for t~h~e popular Finnish rural drama Korpelan kujanjuoksu (Korpela's gauntlet).
Third series has truly been i)n demand: last week ’ s episode p"re"mi"e"re in television was s{een by 722,000 Finns.
The top numbers don ’ t have any practical meaning as su:ch, because there's goin)g t'o be no cont>inua>tion to Heikki Luoma and Jukka Mäkinen ’ s drama.
In the final episode, Ja"ska and Mirkku's relationship takes another leap forward, and Ja(ska ’ s mother probably is the first one t-o guess what is t"o come.
Anssi and Miisa ’ s relations are also wa)rm, one could say positively romantic i~n t=he light of recent events, but the Laiho once again shows up.
Even the poli*c*e is suspicious of the sneaky man.
Probably noo}ne is however able t>o guess Laiho's fate in advance.

Should you go to work tomorrow i^f you have the s"niffles?
Here ar?e the fact-based pros and cons
The flu season i`s underway.
Many are wonderin)g whether t*o stay at home or not.
The hard worke=rs should however consider, wh>ether it is worth it to infect other%s, because the illness can be contagious, even though thei(r own symptoms were minor.
So~met~i~mes flu symptoms attack all of a sudden, sometimes th?ey steal on you.
In the latter si{tuation y]ou may already infect others, even though yo{ur own symptoms would feel minor, Prevention publication describes.
Should you stay h#ome then?
According to Prevention, before a person even experiences symptoms of t~he flu, they are cont:agi:ou:s.
Y^ou ca%n pass the virus from about a day before the first symptoms up until about five to seven days af{ter.
Children with the f;lu may b%e contagious for longer than a week.
As soon as you are aware o#f any symptoms, you should not be in school o)r at work.
Return when y,ou are no longer coughing and no longer have a fever, says medical professor Gregory Polan"d.
Y[ou should also avoid exercise.
To{o quick a return to t&he gym can hamper the recovery.
Also be sure t}o wash your hands and sneeze or cough into a tissue and throw away t?he tissue.
Leaving home when i?ll?
If yo~u must l=eave the house while ill, consider using a face mask.
The mask doesn ’ t filt-er out viruses, but it keeps the u)s)er aware of the head area.
When you wear it, you can't put yo`ur finger in your nose or m/outh, Poland says.
Also sn}eezes are constrained with the mask.
How can you preve#nt infection, then?
The best way is still to wash your han(ds and avoid touching y]our face.
It is hard t:o avoid the latter, though.
For exampl;e, the aver_a_ge American is puttin/g their finger in their eyes, nose, or mouth every 15 to 30 seconds, Poland warns.
New Miss Finlan/d follows the beauty queen tradition: ‘ M=y spouse is an ice-hockey player ’

After his league career in Finland, the hockey player has pla"yed abroad, like i/n Sweden and China.

I`n the early d(ays o"f their dating the couple lived almo[st a year in a long-distance relationship, but later Alina had a chance to travel abroad with his spouse.
I-f I made it to the top th`ree a/nd I could make a living out of that, I don't want to believe it had an)y effect on our relationship.
Even though w]e woul.d have to live apart, our trust in each other is good, and a good thing about a long-distance relationship is that the first spa/rk never goes out, A$lina grinned in May.

Am>b>ulan>ces were sent to Viiala har@b@our to receive evacuated passengers.
For some reason, t^h^e ship, on its way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, had drifted a$way from its route on t|he west side of narrow Jumusensalmi.
The police investigates the reason fo>r the accident.
Fire master on duty Matti Willman said ea?rlier in the evening that the conditions at the lake are difficu+l+t because of darkness and relat}ively high winds.

Ex m[anagers demand unpaid fees from Robert Helenius
A disagreem<ent about money overshadows boxer Robert Helenius ’ tonight's match agai!nst Erkan Teper.
Ilta-Sanomat reported today on the com,plaint by boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Master of Laws trained on the bench Jussi Kokkila, in which ov?er 80,000 euros worth of unpaid manager f/ees with penal interest a!r!e demanded from Helenius.
According t]o the complaint, Helminen and Kokkola worked for Helenius between 15.4=.2014 and 30.1.2015.
We h'ave attempted to settle this, b;ut there is no other option.
There was a clear assignment here, an+d a l-ot of work has been done, Kokkil&a says to Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius ’ current manager, Markus Sundm[an, sent Ilta-Sanomat a repsonse, which narrates t&he boxe%r ’ s view of the events.
Helenius denies to ha[ve an obl^igati^on to pay the required sum.
As stated in the response, Kokkila and Helm%inen had offered their servic=es to Helenius i:n a financially difficult situation, and promised to be able t]o organise matches and sponsor income for him.
Accord)i)ng to the verbatim agreement, Helenius was obligated only to pay a percentage o^f his matches as fees.
Again and again there were assurances that Helenius does not need to pay anythin#g, just to receive the i=ncome they orga'nise.
This i(s a~ls~o a normal and only practice in professional athletes ’ managerial action.
There never was an agreement about paid work, and that would also have been ill-advised in Helenius ’ situation, S}undm}an ex\plain\s in a messa%ge he wrote.
There never was a written agreement about the co"-operation
According to the response, He/leniu/s would hav;e wanted to agree on the income dist#r#ibution in written from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman did n|ot manage to make a draft until the end of 2014.
He discov#ered the draft to be bad for him, and discontinued the co-operation with Kokkila and Hel~minen.
Helenius had no matches while associating with Kokk+il+a an"d Helminen.
A year after their co-operation ended, Helenius received a}n “ unspecified bu"t big ” invoice for manager work.
This year a complaint was fil$ed with t}he same allegations.
H+elenius regards Helminen and Kokkila's subsequent action as c\owardly, the response states.
Today Helenius faces Erkan Te'per, the seventh from I}BF heavyweight contender list, in a match in Stuttgart.
An amiable m>an and a good journalist
Artist and music producer Ilkka ‘ Ile ’ Vainio knew the late r^adio ho,st and journalist Erkki Pälli for dec?ades.
A seasoned radio host and journalist Erkki Pällli passed a/way o$f terminal liver cancer aged 83.
The host's ob)ituary was published in Sunday ’ s Helsingin S~anoma~t.

Päl[li shared his serious illness o/n his Facebook page in March 2018.
Back then the announcement was se%en also b{y Ile Vainio, who grieved the news about a friend's d?est?iny.
In a way he s@aid his goodbyes already earlier in Facebook, Ile Vaini+o said.
Vainio says Er,kki Pälli was a mult-i-talente-d professional, who became an excellent journalist.
He remembers P|älli as a popular person, quick on the uptake an#d telling funny tales.
I ’ ve known Erkki since I was a small bo|y and we_nt to Finnlevy the first time as a 12-year-old t-o start working at their warehouse.
That is when I met Er_kki.
Back then he worked as Finnlevy publici`st a(nd had different duties, Ile Vainio remembers.
As I was promoted to a music producer and made records, there were hundreds of events wher^e Erkki Pälli was p@r@esent as a regular journalist to write stories about th~e artis!ts.
He was alwa{ys wel&l-i&nformed and I saw the passion he had for entertainment, music, and people.
When Erk;ki interviewed someone, he managed to get close t=o his interviewees.
He was an amiable man a{n{d a good journalist.
Many knew him as a respected Yle radio host, but he also w[rote excellent artic|les.

H~e was the music producer on Ve]sa-Mat]ti Loiri ’ s records.
However, Pälli ’ s greatest passion was radio wor/k, whic~h he did with his own, un\ique style.
H=e worked in the radio since 1960s, and became familiar t+o many listeners from Yle's ether.

Finnish Ski Association announced on Saturday that the association ’ s financial per\iod that ended in May recorded a profit of abo)ut 450,%00%0 euro.
The association describes a ‘ complete reversal ’ of t.heir economic situation, e"ven though their finances are certa:in:ly strained by ‘ significant debts in the balance ’.
Executive Director Mika Kulmala praises their fast re*actions and stringent econo%m%ic discipline.
Last autumn, we responded quickly to the si:tuation and made a~djustments.
Caref$ul pla]nni]n]g of operations and financial control are instilled in our whole organisation, Kulmala says i*n the press release.
We have also succeeded in partner acquisition, and in addition the profits f^rom the world cups w{ere maximal during the pa<st season.
However, we must continue to be careful when managi^ng expenses, and at the same time we must constantly loo#k for new forms o`f financing.
I h|eard m}y wife cry for help, but then silence
Dozens of bodies lie in the hospital cou&rtyar&d in the city of Palu, located on Indonesia%n isla^nd of Sulawesi.
Onl.y one building separates them from the area, where the injured survivors are gathered in ord;er to evaluate thei%r injuries and need for treatment.
The p!at!ient!s are also treated outside because of th[e aftershocks.
One of the people moving i)n t]he hospital area was a 52-year-old Palu resident Baharuddin, who was searching for his s/on.
Like many Indonesians, he uses only o&ne name.
I have one child, he ’ s miss#in#g.
I last spoke to him before he went to school in the morning, Baharuddin t+old ne`ws agency AFP.
Dwi Haris, who was lying outside the hospital i(n Palu, had suffered injuri,es in his back a<n<d arm.
When the earthquake began, h&e was in a loc*al hotel with his wife and daughter.
The family ha(d been invited to Pal(u for a wedding.
I wa}s probably caught under a collapsed wall.
I h_eard m+y wife cry for help, but then silence.
I d/on ’ t know what happened to h*er and my child.
I hope they are safe, Haris t]old news agency AP, according to Bri}tish media.
Small sho-ps are looted
In Palu evacuation centre, 35-year-old moth&er of a small child Risa K~usum~a attempted to calm d=own her feverish baby.
She describ`ed the city atmosphere as tense.
T<here is little clean water.
Small small shops a@re looted everywhere, said Kusuma.
Many Palu residents have slept outside or in temp-orary bamboo h_uts.
Even though their homes would s;till be somehow standing, t^he possible aftershocks c_ould destroy them for good, burying the residents.
According to news agency A*P, over half the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after the prison walls colla!p!sed.
Reported@ly there were about 560 prisoners, so the(re are perhaps about 300 fugitives.
The Jaka,rta Post re)ports that also a part of Donggla prisoners have escaped.
According to the newspaper, the prisoners got into a rage and set fire to the prison after the guards had forbidden them from leaving to search fo>r their re[la[tives who had suff~ered from the earthquake and the tsuna}mi.
Palu airport has been re-o~pened mostly for relief flights.
One of the firs,t to land on the airpor=t was a military C-130 transport aircraft bringing relief items.
Commercial flights to P[alu airport a)re allowed only to a limited extent.
The pilots had t~o lan@d to the airfield without air traffic control, because the control tower was badly damag<ed in the earth quake.
A rain sweeps over Finland during t|he night
A long area of precipitation spreads over the co[untry from the w^es^t during the night between Saturday and Sunday.
The rain will be mostly wat`er, but in central and northern Lapland sleet or snow c}an be expected.
L!as!t night ’ s biting cold is not going to repeat, sinc/e the temperature will remain warmer under the clo*ud cover.
An overcast ni@ght keeps the lowest temperatures quite effectively un|der control.
The temperature may temporarily drop below zero in t;h;e fa*r west, the meteorologist on duty, V[il[le Ilkka said.
On Sunday the area of preci]pita]tion will turn eastwar`d during the morning.
The weather will be fair or par]tly cloudy in the sout*h and west.
In the afternoon th]e temperatures up to Oulu latitude are b?etwee?n 10 and 13 degrees.
As to temperatures, the coming week looks to be similar in t+he southern and central p+arts o]f the country, but the weather will be more unsettled.
Wind and wave warning are in effect on th*e sea area+s.
There are no actual autumn gales to be expected in th=e next few days, but otherwise it wi@ll be a typica^lly changeable autumn weather.
It really looks like is going to be a real aut;umn now, Ilkka sai\d.
Miss Finland final won ’ t be seen on tele^vi^si^o^n
IL-TV allows you to follow the red carpet glamour and glitte{r from Miss Finland c(ompetitio(n.
Iltalehti entertainment journalists ho|st a live broadca$st a:t IL-TV from the red carpet of Miss Finland final at Billnäs ruukki.
The broadcast begins around 6.50 p[m.
A new Miss Finland i<s chosen from the ten finalists o)n Saturday.
Mi:ss Finland 2018 final is organised at B-illn-äs ruukki in Raseborg.
Bef`ore the final begins, you c>an follow the atmosphere on the spot via IL-TV live broadcast.
The live bro:adcast begins around 6.30 pm and continues fo}r about an hour.
This year especially many M!iss Finland winners from previous y<ears have been invited to the final.
They are represented in the jury by Miss Fi>nland 19@98, Jonna Ziprus.
Other jury members are well-being sector entrepreneur Jut:ta Gustafsberg, photographer Nadi Hamm\ou\da, Jounin Kauppa CEO Minttu Murphy-Kau/lanen, and Seiska news producer Katja Lintunen.
We hoped she would be admitted to the univer;sity before going t-o a beauty contest
Russian father Dimitri an%d Ingrian mother Svetlana had faith in their daughter ’ s success i(n Miss Finland final.
Pare$nts of the new Miss Finland Ali$na Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov and Svetlana Voronkova, were pro|ud following their daughter ’ s first moments wearing the crown.
They arrived to audience fr%om Pertunmaa, and planned to dr}iv}e back home after the final.
The spirits were wonder#ful!
We believed in Erika the whole time, bu|t half an hour before the r(esu(lts we were beginning to be nerv!o!us, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana is I^ng^rian and Dimitri Russian.
Alina speaks fluent Russian, even though she h)as lived he_r whole childhood in Finland.
Svetlana says that as a small child, Alina wa<s interested in acting and many ot?her things, r'ather than a beauty queen career.
People were of,ten commentin}g that Alina is so pretty she should be a beauty queen.
But sh#e said sh/e wanted to be a radio host.
It w{asn ’ t until later Alina got interested i\n beauty contests.
The parents hoped Alina would be admitted in the unive&rsity before participating in Miss Finland conte/st.
This became tr~ue, and finally Alina wanted to complete he~r Bachelor ’ s degree before beauty contests.
We kept asking already last y#ea#r why she won ’ t participate, but s<he wanted to complete t>he Bachelor's.
The parents believe Alina won because she is a wholesome example for young people an>d for adults, to}o.
S[he exercises a lot and eats a healthy diet.
And A_lina likes to be in th=e limelight, it shows.
Alina ’ s boyfriend Joonas Hurri is a professional ice hockey pl?ayer in Japan, and he wasn ’ t ab/le to come to Fi`nlan`d to support his dearest in the fin@al.
Alin<a ’ s parents believe the pair ’ s relationship will withstand the y|ear as Miss Finland.
It is meant t.o be!
The parents h~ope their daughter would visit them soon.
Now there's bee%n a long break in visits because of the Mi)ss Finland activities.
We miss her alre-ady, even though w*e have sent her messages.
A young man di/ed in a running ov`er - police seized three people
According t=o the police, three peo<ple have been seized in connection to the incident.
Häme police did not comment on the course of the events o+r t^he possible deliberateness of th*e running over, citing incompleteness of investigation.
Neither d&id the police comment on whether the sei<zed people and the man who died in the running over knew eac,h other from before.
Additional information o[n the case will be available in the begin+ning of next week the earliest.
Sari Piippo left h=er career i@n Brussels and became a stay-at-home mother in Finland - go<t a<n idea of a comic and lack of drawing skills did not slow her down
Luomu'hömppä (‘ organic silly ’) originated fro+m an utterance of my husband, whe'n he suggested it could be a person in a story I was develo!ping, desc\ribes Sari Piippo, a comic blogger from Espoo, stay-at-home mother, and former EU translator.
Sari Piippo says she was an EU-translator in Brussels concentrating on economy and law, u`ntil th)e family ’ s fourth child was born te`n years ago and they be@came returning migrants.
I ’ ve loved be{ing a stay-at-home mother.
This has been the best time of my li+fe, but at some point I sta]rted t}o wonder what t~o do when I grow up, and even my youngest one started to be pretty big.
The.n in 2014, comic came in.
Piippo says she had never even drea*med abo#ut making a comic, even though she had been reading Donald Duck, Tintin, and Aste;rix ever since she w]a]s little.
I hadn ’ t drawn since childhood, but when t@hese scripts fo@r Luomuhömppä then started t*o emerge, the situation changed.
First I created some dozens of scripts f'or m+y own pleasure.
M=y da]ug]hter Viivi Valkama (b . 2000) i`s a skilled drawer, but I didn ’ t manage to persuade her to help me until summer 2016, when I bribed Viivi with a dra@wing tablet.
He>r enthusiasm lasted for about a dozen strips, and then I had to start trying myself, Piippo laughs and says the drawing tablet wa{s a gre(at su^pporter for her.
A drawing tablet is an easy and handy way t#o t(ry to get something done.
I didn ’ t even t|r|y to draw on a paper, Piippo describes h?er relationship w%ith drawing, which she usually does in the evenings.
Scri[p[ts po~p up in my mind all t#he time, but usually I never finish a comic at one go.
A single th)ree-pa)nel strip may take even several hours.
I may do one panel a[t a time and I love to play wit-h colours.
Beginning to draw is always the most diffficult thi\ng, since drawing i;sn ’ t my forte.
Sari Piippo says that when it comes to modern com:ics in newspapers, s}h}e appreciates for example Dilbert by Scot:t Adams.
Characters of Luomuhömppä include a carrot-figured mothe(r, obsessed with everything organic and head full of lettuce hai\r.
Other char]ac]ters are Mies (Husband), Pissis (Teen Girl), an/d Kaksoset (Twins).
In the worl{d of Luomuhömppä yo$u are what you eat.
The id'eas for the comic come from the creator ',s own life and social media.
Sari Piippo does not want to preac;h or force any ideas, eve>n though there a-re occasionally more serious subjects in Luomuhömppä.
Piippo says she ha@s her husband and children rea_d the comic.
It ’ s a real%ly great feeling to look at a comic you ’ v%e drawn and think that this is wh$at I did today.
There's challenge enough for a stay-at-home mothe?r!
Luomuhömppä comic is available onl{ine at luomuhomppa.sarjakuvablogit.com

Indonesian earth qu(ake: An air traffic controller sacrified himself - did|n ’ t leave a fractured tower until he managed t"o save hundreds of travellers
A 21-year-old air traffic controller Anthonius Gunawan Agung has b<ec<ome a her>o of Indonesian quake.
Agung st^ayed alone in an ATC tower unti'l he managed to saw off a passenger plane carrying hundreds o"f people from the island being shaken by the quake.
The young man was on duty in the air traffic control at Palu's Mutia@ra SIS Al-Jufrie airport when the earth quake struck o!n F<riday.
As others fled the ATC tow=er, Agung refused to aban{don his post u/nti/l he got a Batik Air passenger plane off the ground.
This way h"e might have saved hundreds of lives, Indonesian aviation authority A}irNav told AFP.
Mutiara SI/S Al-Jufrie airport on Saturday after the quake.
The ATC tower tre%mbled and cracked.
Eventually, Agu}ng jumped from the fourth story of the t*ower in a bid to escape.
He broke h_is leg and suffered serious internal injuries.
Agung wa%s taken to a nearby hospital.
He was to be taken to a better-equipped facility, bu;t died 20 minutes before a helico>pter could arrive, a representative of AirNav told T&he Jakarta Post.
After the flight w@as safely in the air th}e quakes became ever stronger, cul#minatin#g in a 7.5 magnitude jolt.
At least 832 people l`os`t their lives.
AirN[av has honoured Agung's heroism in social media.
Rehn pondered the possibility of Europe escalating in a trade war at Y&le “ W"e must see the next twee=t ”
The tr+ade war between the United States and China i+s reflected in the world economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts h'ave been lowered throughout Europe, and also the Bank of Finland ha$s slightly lowered its own economic growth e%sti%mates.
Speaking at Yle Ykkösaa`mu, Governor Oll,i Rehn said tha't even though increasing tension has no direct effect on European flow o@f trad\e, it does weaken the trust, which in turn is reflected on companies ’ investment decisions.
The same applies t$o the impacts of Finnish comp%anie%s ’ exports.
Rehn thinks so far Europe has taken good care o(f its du+ties.
It has bee)n able to cr-e-ate a truce with the United States, and, for its part, calmed the situation down als(o with China and Japan.
Rehn does not think th@at Europe will be ground under th`e feet of a trade war.
We must s~ee the next tweet and make estimations after t%hat.
Our partner in Washingt?on is quite unpredictable, h@e however said in the Yle interview.
Europe also ha^s its own risks.
One of them is the third largest euro are[a economy I]t]aly, which is als+o one of the most indebted states in the euro ar>ea and the whole Western world.
The ma[rket had a severe reaction t~o a budge(t showing a clear deficit presented by the Italian government on Thursday evening.
Next year's deficit is over 2>.4 per cent o=f GDP.
Rehn con_sid_ers Italian situation to be alarming.
Five per cent of the country ’ s loan stock are problem lo)a)ns, a!nd over ten per ce/nt are unregulated loans.
In addition, the public fin(a(nces are shaky, and again i?t seems that t+he country is going to exceed its liabilities in relation to its European partners.
M[a[y[be w|e should not yet b(e imagining new crises, Rehn replied when inquired whether Italy is leading Europe to a new economic crisis.
Anot<h<er matter taxing Europe i`s British departure from the EU.
Rehn hopes i$t can be settled at peace.
A quarrelsome exit would have much mo,re negative effects.
Rehn began as th^e Ba*nk of Finland Governor in July.
European Central Bank (ECB) P`r`esident Mario Draghi will retire in a b>it over a year.
T\he discussion about his successor has begun.
Both Reh;n's and his predecessor Erkki Liikanen ’ s names have been brought u|p.
It pr`obably is all right, if there are Finnish names inv>olved, R-ehn said, adding that he has no further comments on the matter.
Helsingin Sanomat newsp{aper's sup;er popular Musta laatikko (Black Box) performances continue again next week - last tickets to Helsinki ar+e for sale
Popular Musta laatikko pe;rformances organ]ised by Helsingin Sanomat (HS) continue again next week.
Other perfor|man|ces are in the National The:atre on October 2, 8, and 11.
October 23 Musta Laatikko visits the Tamper,e Theatre for the first t_ime.
There are still some t'ickets left to the National Theat<re.
Tampere performance i&s sold out.
Tick_ets available via Lippu.fi.
During the evening, t.he journalists and pho?tographers on stage share a true story they h{ave been preparing for a long time, and which has never been published i$n any HS medium.
A=ga=in there will be something no one has eve*r heard.
‘ There is a strange spy in Helsinki night, an impressive report from other side of the globe, and a moving story about a very topica<l health-related issue ’, de\scribes Esa Lilja, o-ne of the M<usta laatikko produce,rs.
After t$he show, th-e audience has a possibility to meet HS journalists and photographers to continue the discussion.
Helsingin Sanomat has organised these evenings o}f living journalism for three ye'ars.
They have been popular from t,he beginning, and tickets are ofte#n sold out.
Already over 15,00<0 people have visited the auditorium.
Musta laatikko was awarded as the journalistic ac]t of the year i]n Bonnier gala.
The award c|ommitte|e praised this ne.w way of journalism and the journalists ’ willing^ness to come close to their readres.
Spring 2019 Musta laatikko is i`n the National Theatre in Mar;ch and April.
The show also visits Tampere a:nd Turku.

A missing mushroom picker found thanks to a/n ‘ unconventional e@xperime@nt ’
The Finnish Police '&s drone skills are the top o,f the world: ‘ We are a-sked to provide training ’
Accord-ing to t,he Director of the Police University College, in addition to looking for miss=ing persons, the police can use a drone in crime scene investigation and in intelligence o.perat.ions.
On Tuesday, using a dr|o|ne, O/ulu police found a missing mushroom picker i!n Raahe in only a few minutes.
The Director of the Police Universit.y College, Kimmo Himberg, tweeted about the c]ase and mentioned for example that ‘ thanks to unconventional experimenting and efficient training, we are at the top of th`e w?orld also i!n this ’.
Drone is a fairly new devi^ce, and even newer in polic+e operations.
There are no statistics available about Finnish po&lice bei|ng a master in drone use.
According to Himberg, there i\s a wide consens~us about this.
This h|as been obvious for example when Finnish police's experiences have bee$n reported in international events.
There is a lot o(f interest towards it elsewhere, Himberg say`s.
There are many, who a;re are keen to visit Finland t~o see the police ’ s drone operations.
We are asked to provide tr*ai*ning.
Becomes more and more c{ommo{n
Himberg points out that in Finnish w%inter conditions, finding a missing person as so&on as possible is vital.
As stated, in Raahe case the missing person was fo$und in just a couple o^f minutes using a d;rone.
Finnish Police has already trained hundreds of dron<e pilots.
According to Himberg, the plan i*s to tr'ai'n more.
Already now the drone is used a lot in police operations, and their use will increas@e a}nd become more common in the futu:re.
I dare to s/ay this, Himberg says.
In addition t@o finding missing people, Himbe#rg says the police can use drones in, for example, accident or crime scene investigation a:nd in certain kinds of intelligence opera)tions.
For example if an area must be reviewed from a distance, if th"ere i;s a possible threat of viole]nce there.
In these cases, a drone can b^e us/ed for advance inquiry.
Karjalan Rugby promoted to the first divi{sion
Karjalan Rugby ce-lebrated their 2.nd division win in Kuopio on Saturday.
During the halftime, the Joensuu team was still losing 7-12 to H!el!sin!ki Rug=by Club, but during the second half they s$tar$t$ed to get the hang of the game, defeating their southern guests 26-1;2.
The 2n$d division title also means that Karjala Rugby will b$e promoted to the first division, a histori;c event.
The team has pla_yed in the first already before, but back the{n Finnish rugby series was divided i&nto two levels, FC series and 1st division that had several g]roups.
T*he team plans to accept the league status, but it mea~ns a lot off work for next winter.
The current player roster of less than twen%ty pl$a$ye$rs must be increased to 25.
1st di}vision also means more games and longer game trip,s, so the funding must be organised accordingly.
Kot@kani@emi to begin his seaso-n in Montreal, head coach confirms
T<he he{ad coach of NHL tea+m Montreal Canadiens, Claude Julien, confirmed on the team ’ s Twitter account that the Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi begins h"is season in Montreal.
M*ontreal reserved the p;r;odigy Kotkaniemi, 18, during the first round as numb/er three in the summer ’ s Entry Draft.
Th*e forward joined Montre>al practice strength in the late summer, and has perfomed well in the September pr_actice matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to scor^e in his ve)ry first practice match.
The head coach Julien said the Finn has tak_en bi'g development steps since he arrived at the rookie camp.
NHL seas&on be,gins next week the night between Wednesday and Thursday Finnish time.
Montreal faces Toronto Maple Leafs i^n the opening round.
What is a g@ood leader like?
This wee@k Finland has heard a lot of discussion a\bout leadership.
Chairman of Nok=ia, Risto Siilasmaa, discussed his book Transforming Nokia t^hat deals with his leadership philosophy in an interview for Helsingin Sanomat (H_S).
At the same time h&e criticises his predecessor chairman Jor+ma Ollila's leadership style.
Ollila categor]icall]y denied the claims, but also earlier report`s on N;okia have discussed the leaders ’ inability to work as a team; the culture of fear and silence that in part c'aused the downfall of the mobil<e phone business.
T!he risk-takin%g capacity and agility of the company's rise period were lost.
Thi!s week also saw the business life m~ega event Nordic Business Forum organised in Helsinki . The event gathered the cream of Finnish b"usiness to Messukeskus.
In addition to the main star B^arack Obama, 12 stars of business world wer@e seen on the stage.
The(re was a lot of talk about good leadership.
Leadership theory l%egend Gary Hamel said t.hat a good leader must have the courage to take a company to the futur@e also when everything is going fine.
The problem is that decisions are made by those, who are m$ost mentally bound t=o the de{c{isions of the past.
J%ohn Ma=ckey, the founder of Whol[e Foods supermarket chain known for its extensive organic product se^lection, said a leader has to be able to convey the company meaning to the whole staff.
And that me.aning has to be so!m!et!h!in!g more besides simply making profit for the owners.
Author o`f a succ*es*sful book on introverts, Susan Cain expl#aine#d research has proven the most successful leaders to be humble.
They a$c$t in a pea&cef&ul, quiet, and determined manner.
Often they ar-e introverts.
Professor of F#inan#ce Aswath Damodaran reminded the listene]rs that a good lead=er's characteristics must match the company ’ s life cycle stage.
In the ear=ly stage of the company a leader must be able t.o tell a story on which t\he company's future is founded.
A company grown to a mature stage nee?ds a leader who know the number~s.
These lessons were attended b&y 7,500 N.ordic Business Forum visitors - mostly Finnish leaders.
They were a?t a risk of an information overload.
Being a g~ood leader requires a lot.
That is why leadership so often fails, als,o on the highes_t level.
Siilasmaa and Ol^lila were also present.
They had a friendly discussion behind-the-sce"nes.
Though they were hardly contemplating whether th(ey were the rig/ht leaders for Nokia at the right time.
And their humility was not easy to es-timate as an outs\ider.
Stun{ning Sara Chafak a^r^rived at the red carpet straight from Los Angeles - spends most of her year abroad
Mode!l Sara Chafak arrived a)t beauty contest final in a stunning black dress.
The fantastic dress of Miss Finland 2012 a-l-so had a lacy tr;ai;n.
I have a slight jet la`g.
I came from Los Angeles a`gain.
I pretty much s.pe.nd most of my time there, Chafak tells he{r news.
Chafak say's she goes to auditions in L.A.
She has done for exa/mple commercial shoots.
She describes h:er work i&n the States as interesting, and also similar with what she does in Finland.
S?he does howeve(r say that it ’ s i_mpo_r_t_a_nt to work even harder, because it ’ s easy to find a replacement for a model.
You must push harder and b*e aggressive, Chafa/k says.

Danish p}olice found the Volvo searched for i'n a large operation: ‘ We cannot disclose where ’
Danish police ’ s extensive hu_nt has paid off.
In the beginnin{g o!f the operation, the Great Belt Bridg%e and the Oresund Bridge were closed to the traffic.
All overland and ferry traff?ic from Zealand island to Sweden, Germany, and ot#her parts o,f Denmark was suspended.
The police was looki&ng for a Swedish-registered Volvo V90.
IS spoke with the shift manager from Copenhage poli-c-e med(ia centre.
T%he missing car has been found.
We cannot ye)t disclose whe*re the car was found, says Henrik Storm fo%rm Copenhagen police communications to Ilta-Sanomat.
According to Storm, the police does not b{eli{eve th(e miss:ing black Volvo has no direct connection to the threat.
According to him, the biggest dan|ger is over.
Danish Ekstra Bl%ade%t reported the police press br*iefing on Saturday.
Th"e officer in charge o:f the in^vestigation, Jørgen Bergen Skov, kept silent about the progress of the operation.
He did n|ot w(ant to tell the category of the offence for the investigated case.
Skov di^d however say it i/s a ‘ serious crime ’.
It was a matter of thr"eat to human life.
Three people have bee}n searched for during the operation.
Th"e police do not say whether they have been alr_eady caught.
According to the newspaper, the ferr&y s;ervice limitations have been cancelled.
The Cop\enhagen p`o`l`ice followed the events also via their Twitter account.
STT reports that according to the police, the general public has no reason to worry, b-ecause th`e threat was directed at certa+in people.
The name of Macedon?ia has been a cause for disagreement for d~e~cades - now the nation votes on the issue in a quarrelsome v"ot"e
Macedonia, located in the Balkans, i}s currently voting on the proposition for the cou^ntry's new name.
According to a deal between Macedonian an;d Greek governments, the n^ame would be Republic of North Macedonia.
So far Greek has vetoed Macedon\ia ’ s bids to join NATO and E!U.
Accordi*ng to Greece, Macedonia is the name o&f its northern region.
The question in the referendum does not mention a ne{w name, but inquires whether the voter support M.aced.onian membership in EU and NATO by accep}t}ing the deal.
T*he voting had a slow start at leas^t in a school located in the centre of capital city Skopje.
A retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, who voted at the school, hoped that the deal ga&ins su|pp|ort.
Referendum means change, i`f it opens th[e doors to Europe and to NATO.
It m#ea#ns change esp~e~c~ia~lly for the young people, she said.
I:n official communications, the na&me used for Macedonia, independent since 1991, ha?s been the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Zaev ’ s government has campaigned for th}e ratification of t!he deal.
T.he nationalist right wing oppositi%on, including the President Gjorge Ivanov, have encouraged people to boycott the referendum.
In additi(on to t;he result, there is the the voter turnout to wait for: whether it will be over the r)equired 50 per cent.
Th<e referendum is n/ot binding, but if t>he yes votes win, it would give a mandate to change the constitution.
To change the constitution, a majority of two thi#rds in t\he parliament is required.
The Greek parliament also has to r?at?i?ficate the deal.
The polling stations a%re closed eight o ’ clock i;n the evening Finnish time.
A handsome v^i^ctory!

Teper was un=able to get up from the mat.
‘ Nordic Nightmare ’ hurt his opponent already in th>e third round, when the G{e{rman ’ s n!ose started bleeding.
T%his was Helenius and Teper's first encounter i[n the ring.

Can?ad?a is racing against time to reach an agr>eement on Nafta with the U.S.
Time is running ou\t in the negotiations on free trade agreement Nafta between th<e United States and Canada.
The United States set the deadline for Sunday, and the countries ’ negotiato[rs have h)ad intensive discussions through th}e weekend.
Canadian head negotiator, Foreig&n Minister Chrystia Freeland postponed her address in the United Nations General Assembly i|n order to fully focus on the trade n\egotiations.
A#t President Donald Trump's insistence, the United States, Canada, and Mexico s?tarted th:e negotiations to reform the North American Free Trade Agr)eement Nafta about a year ago.
In the end of August, Mexico and the U.S. reached a bilateral underst?a?nding, bu$t so far there has been no ag>reement with Canada.
The Uni(t(ed States a~n~d Mexico want to validate the agreement before th$e winner of Mexican presidential election, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador takes office in the beginning of December.
Trump has said it ’ s not essential t#o include Canada i$n the agreement.
Earlier he notified the Congress that the plan is to sign the agreement in t(he end of November - wheth"er Canada is involved in it o'r not.
Because of these schedules, the tex,t o<f an agreement between the U.S. And Canada has to be ready on Sunday, s`o th/e United States Congress has enough time left to evaluate it.
A neig@h@bour thought candles ’ flickering was a fire in Ka/a/kkuri - fire department called to the scene
Candles burned in a fl#at at Ka^akkuri in Oulu cause?d a fire alarm on the night between Saturday and Sunday.
About te{n fire depar>tment unit were called to th[e scene because of a possible fire in a block of flats.

There wa<s no fire in the location.
The police seized 1"1 people after the matc`h between Honka a(nd HJK - rowdiness on the field and in a metro station.
The police seized elev,en pe:ople on i_n Espoo on Saturday after a men's football league match between Honka and HJK, confirmed Detective Inspector Teemu Värtinen from Western Uusimaa Police Department to the Finnish News Agenc&y STT.
The rationale for apprehension was protection from of`fence and d`ist`u`rb`ance.
The apprehend'ed were released after the situation had calmed down, sa#id Värtinen.
The apprehensions were earlier r;eported by Ilta-Sanomat.
The match en<d<ed in a goalless draw.
After the final whistle, a great number of spectators rushed t*o th\e field from the section reser?ved for HJK supporters.
The situation escalat\e\d i'nto pushing and shoving as well as fist fights between the two teams ’ supporters.
Mounted p*olice officers were also needed to stop th:e situation.
In addition to the football field, there was some brawling going on in the area o)f a nearby metro station, where som;e o.f the a#ppre#hensions also took place.
I was not pres:ent, but what I could see from the pictures, it was an unpleasant situation, Värtinen referred t[o t(he pushing and shoving o*n the field.
Acco<rding to Värtinen, there have been no criminal complaints do*ne after the events.
Pöytäkivi chased his Finnish butterfly record in the world cup, a\lso Laukkanen swa>m to finals
Jenna Laukkanen and Riku Pöytäkivi made it t(o the finals in the closing day o*f Swimming Wo?rl?d Cup's competition 3/7 in the Netherlands.
The short-course meets a<re held in Eindhoven.
Pöytäkivi from HSS chased his Finnish record i>n 50m butterfly, placing second in the prelimi]naries with a time o%f 22.82.
Earlier in September in He.lsinki Pöytäkivi swam t=he Finnish record time 22.77 for this style and distance.
Ari-Pekka L$iukkon$en, representing Espoo t~eam Cetus, was 24th in butterfly, his time was 24.68.

In the 200m individua%l medley Laukkanen was 15.th with this time 2.14,25.
Students act a r%a%re treat: a classical tragedy - simple Oresteia impresses w\i\th its visuality.
Classical tragedies ar"e a rare treat on Finnish stages.
Fo&r example, there h&as not been a classical tragedy in the Finnish National Theatre since So$phocles ’ Philoctetes in 1998.
Now Theatre Academy takes the only complete clas`sical trilog#y, Oresteia by Aeschylus, to a tour that begins from the Na%tional Theatre.
Beginning in 2015, the Lavat auki! productions hav$e actor students fr<om th{e Theatre Academy working internationally together with a professional director.
This fourth production, just l{ik{e the first one, is directed by Mik_ko Roiha, who resides in Be@rlin.
Oresteia ha+d its international premiere in Berlin in April.
Roiha ’ s adaptation o#f Oreste/ia laudably condenses the tale of how the curse upon the doomed House of Atreus is lifted and a constitutional state is formed to 8!0 minutes by condensing especially th%e chorus parts.
The pla]ym]anages to be quite faithful to the sp$irit of Kirsi Simonsuuri ’ s excellent translation (2003).
Dramatic lights and presentation revealing the sid#e#s of the theatre spac*e emphasise the simple and clear stage thinking.
I,n the centre of it alternates th[e dynamics between actors playing main roles, stepping forward from the chorus i,n turn, and the chorus.
The performa<nce utilises bo/th double and triple portrayals of the main roles.
The actors never leave the stage, so als\o for example the murders of Agamemnon, who returns from the war of Troy, a#nd hi*s prize of w&ar, Cassandra, are shown on the stage, unlike in the classical tra|d|ition.
O)f course the performance does not even claim to be faithful t'o the classical performance tradition.
I`f anything, the viewer is presented w"ith a modern interpretation, faithful to the text, and continuously aware of its ritu?al-like roots.
Roiha has managed to create a rhythmic gr.oup fro~m the Master-level actor students, a grou+p that performs as a tight-knight team, even as a single organism.
The chorus parts especially are where the actors an;d their very expressive, sculpture-like group formations do themselves justice in t+he bare sta;ge adorned only by a white curtain.
Im|pr|essive.
Oresteia's performance tour contin&ues in Kouvola and Oulu T[he[a[tres.
Korean manufacturer making its first hydroge`n lorry
The new model will be seen in Europe especially due to a co-operation agreement b@etween Hy)undai and S.wis.s H2 Energy.
According t:o the co-operation agreement published in the IAA Commercial Vehicles 2018 exhibit in Hanover, Hyundai will provide a 1,000 of these ne`w lorries to be used by Swi<ss compan^y and its partners.
By bringi?ng a fuel cell electric lorry t%o the market, Hyundai continues on the road pave|d with Nexon and ix35/Tucson Fuel Cell models as a manufacturer of hydr&ogen cars.
We continue to develop th\e fu*el cell technology even furt=he=r with this project, first of its kind in the world.
W|e will continue to seek opportunities for expanding these lorri?es into other markets by for example monitoring fuelling infrastructure, Hyundai Motor ’ s Executive Vice President In Ch(e(ol Lee said in the agreement ’ s la$un$ch event.
Fists were doing the talking on several o)cc)asions in Kajaani
A man in his thir/ties assaulted three men in a restaurant in the centre o;f K%ajaani and in front of it on Saturday after midnight.
First the man hi@t a man inside t<he restaurant, after which he was removed from the premises.
Outside he pushed another man t;o the gro$un$d, and as a third man intervened i`n the situation, the attacker hit him, too.
The police seized the att"acker.
The man continued to a>ct in an aggressive m>an>ner in the police station, kicking on%e of the police in the leg.

Also another a|ssault took place on Välikatu in the centre o>f Kajaani on Saturday after midnight.
A victim w~as assaulted by two men.
Firs)t a Kajaani man i\n his twenties hit the victim.

A long-term radi"o host Erkki Pälli has died
Erkki P>älli, known as Yle's long-time journalist died of c#ancer aged 83.
Radio host Erk)ki Pälli, 83, has died.
He passed away of terminal liver cancer he told about on his Facebook page i+n March 201&8.
This is th|e end now.
Even t>he doctor has said it, I live one day a!t a time, h=e commented his situation to Iltalehti a month ago.
T#he security of ladies and men in shops must be g/u/aranteed
The fi%rst time I was p<aid for a newspaper story was in 1984.
With this level of exper]ienc]e, wh)en a news story manages to astonish me, it i}s usually a big thing.
When I wrote (Karjalainen, 27.9 .) about the insecurity of workers in retail, I wa&s astonis]hed and occasionally ev!e!n a bit angry.
For that story, I also talked with Erika Käh^ärä, Service Union United (PA"M) sp>ec>ialist in working environments.
She says the crime statistics do not reveal th]e actual s=ituation.
This is a growi"n"g problem, even though employers naturally claim othe(rwise.
Th'e police are informed only abo\ut those cases that are clearly seriou#s, and many real violent situations are left unreported.
‘ Based on the Occupational Safety and Health Act the c(ompanie(s certainly have a responsibility to compile statistics of their close call situations, but these statistics are fo<r int=ernal u|s|e only, and their information is not c:ollected anywhere ’, she said.
The mental injuries are not included i=n the statistics.
Violent situations always have had the problem that ther~e do not always r+esul+t in physical injuries.
Despite this, psych>ological traumas ca`n be much more severe than bruises and cuts.
It is difficult t_o draw a line between a violent situation and an impending violent situation, sinc%e also aggressive threats o.f a certain level must be considers as violence - even though there was no ph"ysi"cal violence.
T<o<o many are afraid at their workplace, even though n~o actual violence would happen.
So)me neighbourhoods are troubled.
The sho,p has hired security guards.
When the business opening hours became deregulated, the"re was a lot of d+iscu+ssion also in the media about its effects to the sales-persons ’ safety.
‘ Back t-h-en quite a few employers organised security gua'rds for at least the night-time hours and to prevent working alone ’, Kä/hä/rä commented.
When nothing happens, wrong conclusions are d*rawn.
This seems to have had a'n effective influence, bu=t this brings about a new negative trend.
When security managed to control the disturbances, an impression was created that thi"s security woul:d be unnecessary.
N\ow many places are l_ooking for solutions to eliminate expensive security services.
Petty assault is an actionable offence, and it is quite under'standable that an assaulted salesperson does not want to make a requ*est for investigation about a|n offender who usually lives close to the sh,op.
But, according to a subsection in the same 2011 a?c?t, petty assault is under a prosecutioner ’ s jurisd=iction, if it takes pl=ace in a workplace.
I think we ne%ed precedents now.
The next time a shop lady or m,an is assaulted, the police should investigate and the prosecutor p@r@osecut@e.
After a court would put a few a%ssailant%s t]o prison, and if the judgement is from the tougher end of th*e p.enal scale, the manners would smarten up.
A soc_ie_ty that requires a small place food shop to be ope}n nearly d:ay and nigh should guarantee the safety of shop assistants.
Heidi Sohlberg taunted a beauty que\en before live broadcast - ‘ Sara, remember t$hat Iiro is married ’
This year, the b/eauty q>ueen coronation w*on ’ t be seen traditionally on TV, but it ’ s broadcast via Viafree site.
T@he show will be hosted by ex Miss Finland, Heidi Sohlberg, and the host of Viasat's and V!iaplay '!s NHL and KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
The host for backstage an:d red carp{et is Janni Hussi.
Before live broadcast, the host trio i:nformed the invited gues#ts and media representatives present about how the broadcast will progre)ss.
In the beg[inni[ng, Sohlberg asked the audience t=o give Harjula resounding applauds.
Scream n=ow, ladies!
Loo-k at our male host, Sohlberg enthused over her colleague whi,le the audience cheered.
Ma`ny Miss Finlands from earlier years follow the contest from the fir`st row.
Among others, Sara C_hafak and Sara Sieppi were sitting next to each other, and Sohlberg cracked a jok;e to either of the|m.
Sara, remember tha+t Iiro is married!
Sohlberg cracked, look{ing at Saras.
Most likely S;ohber;g directed her jok}e to recently divorced Sieppi, who laughed at the comment, e=ven though she first looked confused.
Sieppi discussed h]er divorce the first time i'n Ilta-Sanomat weeked newspaper.
Th<e be;auty queen said she doesn ’ t want to publicly open up about the reasons for the divorce, because tha[t is just between her and Roope Salminen.
S&he said she ’ s i`n no hurry to find a n|ew relationship, but that she is going to focus on herself.
I will focus on my own things, and above a=ll, wil^l begin to live my life by myse)lf, Sara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marital stat-us emerged also later, when Sohlber~g accidentally called Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.
The host tr\io shared a laugh at the blunder.
Was n'@t Iiro married, or how was it?
Janni Hussi ackno&wled&ged the mistake.
An Ostrobothnian man tortured his domest<ic partner by slash<ing, burning and feeding a strong sauce to her
P!ohjanmaa (Ostrobothnia) District Co.urt has sentenced the 34-year-old Kokkola resident to three years of imprisonment f?or the numerous crimes against his domestic partner.
The means o>f commission of the offe?nce include, amo(ng others, a belt, a cable, and cable ties.
The court sentenced these ob-j-ec-ts forfeited to the state.
T<he most severe charge concerned a suspected aggravated rape.
This charge was however dismi[ss[ed by the district court.
The Kokkola man was considered gui+lty of four assaults, and aggravated assault, coercion, ill$ega$l threat, deprivation o&f liberty, aggravated deprivation of liberty, and t/wo malicious damages.
The crimes were committed between the 26th of last March a<nd 24th of l|ast May.
After the final deeds, the man was apprehended a>nd detained a couple of days lat$er.
On Thursday of the pa*st week, Pohjanmaa District Court passed its judgement a~nd ruled that the 34-year-old must continue t+o be kept in Vaasa prison.
No proof about th:e rape
The 34-year-old was a\lso accused of two aggravated depriva^tions of liberty and of an aggravated rape on t-he 22nd of May.
The cour`t however dropped these charges as unsubstantiated.
The case was tried b$ehind closed doors.
The district court j/udge gave a public report on th;e sentence, though.
According to the d.istrict court judge, the accused had directed violence, threatening, and coercion t\o his domestic partner i&n situations where she was tied.
The accused slashed hi%s vi>ctim with a knife, burned her with a cigarette, fed h<er strong sauce, and poured water and coffee on her.
With its sentenc|e, the court ordered that the means of commission of the offence were to b*e forfeited to the state: a belt and a c\able, cable ties, a bathrobe bel&t, a k,nif,e, and a billhook.
Four witn;esse;s
According to t|he district court, the parties continued living together betwe'en the deeds.
The judicial d%ecision states that a large number of the most s>eri>ous deeds happened in th}e end of the crime period.
Four witnesses were heard in t%he court, two women and t?wo men.
The 34-year-old must pay 5800 euros as compensation for pai'n, ache, suf+fer+ing, and temporary damage.
Doubtfully h^e has such money, since the convict already h>as earlier debts in collection.
The imprisonment is not th]e man's first.
Iltalehti will not publish the name of the convict in order to protect th:e victim ’ r priv>acy.
During the time of writ>i>ng, the r$e$cent district court sentence is not non-appealable.
Europe in a four-point l,ea,d to Ryder Cup finals
Europe'an golf professionals strengthened their lead against United States in the traditio#nal match play game on Saturday.
Europe lea%ds 10-6 in Ryder Cup played near Paris, when the"re are still twelve Sunday twosomes coming.

Earlier n[o European pair has reached a fe,a,t like that.
On Sunday the twosome attempt to make more h+istory.
N@o European player has won five points in a single Ryder Cup, and only three Ameri%can%s have managed such achievement: Arnold Palme'r and Gardiner Dickinson (196\9) and Larry Nelson (1979).

A Philippine inventor fl:ies with a drone car - this i,s how you avoid traffic jams
Mendiola is a Philippine inventor, hip hop dancer, a?nd a Gyro Gearloose o[f some sort.
He is one member of th.e growing group who swear to have invented a flying ca<r - or at least their own version of i@t.
He has c+ompetitors such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does n>ot believe in t@he mass manufacturing of his vehicle.
According to reports from from the world, he has used a grea]t d"eal of his fortune to bu[i[ld his dream.
Six years ag,o he began developing his flying car.
Now he calls his development version a dron ca>r.
He says he recently c<onducte<d t/he first su<ccessful test flight - he floated in over seven metres with his machine.
One of his g^oals was to avoid traffic jam.
I h`ope the machine evokes positive reactions.
Five years ago this was just a drea>m, Mendiola said according t-o British Daily Mail.
JHL anticipates: Industrial action beginning tomorro#w will be visible in children ’ s d{aycare and in social and heal}th services
Overtime and shift-trading bans beginning tomorrow in the public and welfare sectors c`oncern especially social and health services an?d ch!ildren's daycare, estimates Päivi Niemi-Laine, President of JHL (the Trade Un'ion for the Public a.nd Welfare Sectors).
Th=e impact will be wide, and it will most certainly manife,st in not having enough staff available.
Everyone has to think ab:out how t$o collect their children.
The employer ’ s task now is to take car#e of the services and tha*t n{o one ’ s life is in danger, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the lack of employees was vi@sible also in the beginning o&f the year, when JHL members wer|e banned from overtime a,nd shift-trading because of agreement negotiations.
Through their flexibility, t!he employers hav@e made possible to not h'ire staff, but use employees ’ overtime or shift-trading.
T]his is not yet an industrial action.
W<hen talking about occupational safety a-nd health, it is a normal thing to take care that each employee has regular working hours and works o_nl_y those regular hours.
W=i=t=h these actions, JHL opposes the governments attempts to wea|ken the lay-off protection in small businesses.
Labour market director for munic:ipal employers Markku Jalonen will not estimate the effects of overtime and shift-trading ban!s i]n advance.
However, he does not believe them to be very revolutionary, eve(n if t*he services can weaken.
Employers around Finland are a,ware of this and have made the possible p,reparations.
T[h[e public, welfare and technical sector covers such a wide area that it is difficult to sa;y anything.
The effects can very quite a lot dependi)n)g o<n field, region, and employer, Jalonen told STT.
Jalonen said some experiences were received already last week when the Finnish Union o(f Practical Nurses Super a=nd the Union of Health and Social Care Professionals Te=hy, among oth}ers, organised similar three-day actions.
Their effects remained q{uit{e small.
J*HL overtime an,d trade-shift ban applies to for example employees in municipalities, church, and state, as well as in private soci{al and health sector.
For example family daycare providers have been excluded from th!e ba&n.
At t@his stage, the industrial action applies t)o nearly 100,000 JHL members.
According to Niemi-Laine, JHL actions ca}n potentially last for a lo*ng time.
The union is prepared to t~ake other i/ndustrial actions, if drafting of the lay-off bill continues.
The gover@nment should no:w recognise that they are running against a wall in high speed.
In Jalonen ’ s opinion, bo_th the trade union movemen@t and the government must meet the other halfway.
T#he unusual thing here i{s that people are already pulling out their big guns, even tho~ugh the proposition has yet to be made, wonders Jalonen.
Great Barrier Reef is formed by children and adults - performance exercises consist of learning t#he motions o`f a ray an"d a sea horse
Great Barrier Reef by Other Spaces collective had its premiere last spring in Hamburg, and last Saturday was its second performance in Finlan{d, this time i\n Kann&eltal&o.
Just li*ke the previous performance of the group, Great Bar=rier R=eef is a performance that is created together with the audience from the beginning until the end.
Th]i]s time, however, also a more clea|rl|y-|defined performance is formed to refresh an%d distil the perceptions from the beginning exercises.
There is plenty of fantastical magi^c in this theatre play also f#or children participants.
A c\hild ’ s view has been considered also in the preparatory stage of the performan;ce.
Still, Gre)at Barrier Reef is not a children ’ s performance, b*ut a per`fo`rmance formed in co-operation between the adults and the children.
It gives the adults knowledge and observations about the way children receive information an.d create a+rt.
T>he children ’ s ability to throw thems;elves in the exercises and common games als?o dispels the distance between grown-ups and children.
Great Barr%ier Reef has a little b~it of a fairy-tale ballet, circuit training, and nature-themed lesson in i`t, but its final setting is organised around different visit]s to non-human situations.
Great Barrier Reef begins with learning about corals and about movements of o*rganisms and fi*sh w'ho live within the reef.
Six different exercise groups teach for example about the motions o:f a ray a[nd a seahorse.
Finally a performance lasting a little under an hour i;s formed, and in it the music, lights, shiny paints a|nd costumes help in getting to know the life within the cor[al r[eef.
I#n Great Barrier Reef, the pa:rticipants are both diving p(eople observing the life within the reef, and corals that are being observed.
They als$o play the part of organisms observing corals.
The lo"oks at many different directions and perceptions create a performance that i\s dense and teeming with life.
To be an organism ’ s view, and organ\is\m observing a view, or an or=gan=ism or view observin"g another organism - and all this a,t the same time.
Children seem to have no probl{e{m{s to do this.
Other Spaces collective ’ s exercises aim to reach the limit between thinki<ng a|nd action, but it is challenging to reach it when the group is co@mprised of both chi$ldren and adults.
On the other hand, children ’ s participation makes i.t more meaningf<ul.

Chi?ldren grow up too fast - I ’ m happy there were no smart phones when I was a c_hild
Prese{nt-day children and young people are m(ore and more irresponsible.
Young people sta?r?t smoking and drinking when they ’ re younger a*nd younger.
I think children should be children thoughout their ch*i*ldhood, an*d not mess up thei+r lives be=c=ause of intoxicants and sex, because all the others say they are doing that.
I was taken aback, w.hen my friend told me sh?e had had to pick up h:er fifth-former sister from her ‘ boyfriend ’ s ’ house during weekend.
When she came to get h?er d=runk=en sister, she told about her sex experiences from that evening.
I could ’ ve not imagined my own sister i<n the same situation, because throughout our childhood we've been told and ad#v#ised that we shoul|d not touch intoxicants and sex is an adul<t thing.
I hope present-day children could live a proper childhood, and they wouldn ’ t need t&o grow up too early because of t_h_e peer pressure created by f[riend[s.
I keep seeing younger and younger girls on Instag;r;a;m, wearing make-up and revealing clo,the,s in their pictures.
Snapchat i#s used during evening to take a*nd send revealing pictures.
It is more and more di_fficult to guess, whi)ch age the girls are.
Present-day 13-year-ol~ds ca{n easily look like they ’ re 18 or even older.
My childhood consisted of playing i)n t#he forest and boardgames.
I ’ m happy there were n;o smart p'ho'ne's when I was a child.
I got to be a child for many, many years, and I did%n ’ t ha)ve to wonder what other}s think about me.
Y.le: Official have told the political leaders that the case Airiston He-lmi has nothing to do with natio+nal security.
In an inter~view with Yle, Ilkka Kanerva said Finnish Security Intelligence Service and Finnish Def/ence Forces came to inform th>e Defence and the Foreign Rig)hts Committees earlier this week.
The Finnish state leadership has been told that Airiston Helmi investigation currently has nothing to d[o with national sec)urity, bu`t organised crime, Yle reports.
The anonymous sources ’ information was confirmed to Yle by the Chair of t!he Defence Co<mmittee, Ilkka Kanerva (Nation{al Coalition).
According to Kanerva, the Def-enc-e Forces and the Security Police visited the Defence and the Foreign Rights Committees to tell abo_ut the ong!oin!g investigation.
This is primarily co(n(sidered as financial crime.
They we}r}e rather strict about not speculating about anything else, Kanerva commented i(n the Yle interview.
A^ccording to Yle inform-ation, the attached material so far has not shown any connection to national security, b:ut the investigation is just beginning.
We have no way of k`nowin`g what might yet be revealed, one o#f Yle's interviewees stated.
The extensive house searches started a wee@k ago in the Turku archipelago an[d on mainland beg the question a@bo@ut whether the investigation is simply about financial crime or if it has something to d^o with Finnish internal security.
Ear.lier this week, Iltalehti put together an article scrutinising the allegations both pro a-nd con.
Video: a dream goal sa)ved Liverpool from the fir~st loss in the series
Liverpo"ol winning streak in the Premier League came to an end, but i!t was still the happier team after a 1-1 dra'w at Stamford Bridge.
T%his Sunday it wil=l be exact(ly one year after Manchester City arrived at Stamford Bridge and left with a 1-0 away win.
Back then Pep Guardiola ’ s combination s]ent a signal to the whol^e P:r:emier League that City is now serious.
Everyone remembers h,ow the last season ended.
A!n!d surely Liverpool manager Jürgen Klopp had the s&ame idea when coming to West London.
The Reds ha'd started th`e League with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool h+ad a stronger start, and especially Virgil van Dijk seemed t/o control his end o`f the field alone.
As for Chelsea, on Wednesday they won a fine F.ootba.ll League Cup away wi{n on Anfield Road.
Then Eden Hazar*d came off the bench to decide the match with a beautif^ul individual performance.
Obviously now Hazard was playing from the ver,y fir`st minutes.
O~n the 25th minute he first played a tight triangle w}ith Mateo Kovacic and Jorginho.
Finally the Croatian s|aw Hazard rushin>g forward and sent him a perfectly balanced through ball.
Hazard strayed a bit t?o the edge o;f the penalty box, but from there managed to s,w,eep a perfect left-footed volley in to the lower corner.
Pool's Brasilian goalie Alisson was a bi|t slow wit_h his save and on'ly managed to touch the ball with his fingertips.
Klopp must have felt the lo=sing position being slightly unfai)r, since almost right af}ter Antonio Rüdiger cleared Mo Salah's shot from the goal line.
In the second half, also Chelsea keeper Ke!pa saw some serious acti!on.
Basque goalie had a quick reaction to Sadio Mané ’ s shot, and pushed the ball from the foot of the g!oal p.ost t&o a corner kick.
As fo@r the other end, Al#isson resetted Hazard's fast break with his dive.
The guests ’ best chance came on the 72nd minute, as Jame]s Mil]ner's crossing found Bobby Firmino.
H#owever, the s?tar Brazilian's header was directed toward~s his national team mate David Luiz, which saved the home team's lead.
Eve}n that didn't hold anymore on the 89th mi<nute, when substitute Daniel Sturridge had a fre}e shot from 25 metres.
Sturridge was playing on his o?ld home stadium, and to honour t(hat, the forward th^rew a powerful shot in the upper corner.
Liverpool's winning start of the League c'ame to an end wi#th the 1-1 draw, but it still holds the top position - toget!her with Manchester City.
Chelsea is also still going for the championship with only two poin>t>s from th"e top.
Discussion about clock switching di`vid`es the people
I reme?mber some decades ago a newspaper asking several Finnish influential persons wha]t divides Finnish people.
O|n|ly response I remember was Juice Leskinen ’ s: ‘ Nen ’ en*d*ing.
So(m(e surnames ha/ve a ‘ nen ’ ending, some do not.
Dividing lines can spring up anywhere, and this wa)s one of the possibl(e reasons.
In EU, Finland has achieved that this annual cloc!k cha^n^ging is about to become history.
Many agree that switching clo}cks t@wice annually has been simply foolery, and that it has caused many problems.
In th|e end, this achievement seems to be the easiest part of the solutio.n, even though it has not been that eas.y.
The most difficult p{a{rt now is to choose the ultimate time: current summer or winter time, or some oth>e>r t?ime zone.
The people can a'lso have their say on otaka*n*taa.fi site.
T^he online survey has been opened b<y th<e Ministry of Transport and Communications, and it will be open until Friday 12 October.
Discussions are heated both around coffee t,ables and i/n social media, and everyone has som:ething to say about the matter.
Those favouring winter time justify th_eir opinion with the effects o`f morning sunlight to peoples ’ well-being, and those defending summer time with th!e effe`cts of evening light on peoples ’ will to spen^d time outside and that way to their well-being.
Both sides hav=e solid supporters and good arguments.
According to research, morning l?ight sets t.he pace for a person ’ s day and increases energy levels.
On the other hand, if a person does not particularly suffer fro|m waking up when it ’ s dark, ligh?t increases the ti[me people spend outside and better en/ables for example autumn yard work.
The amount of extra light hou;rs after a normal work da%y has already been calculated.
I would rather tak.e bo.th, bu=t it ’ s unlucky that we cannot help our location in the northern corner of the Earth.
The w+in+t+ers are anyway too dark, the summer!s too light for many people.
It is typical for discussion>s about this m|at|ter to support one ’ s own views and oppose the other s*ide very uncompromisingly.
There is no nee|d to listen to the justifications of the opposing side, since the most important thing i|s how one feels about the m>atter.
Since almost everyone has an opinion abou[t this matter, it i.s somewhat pointl.ess to try to change someone ’ s mind.
It is ef;fort well wasted.
It is easy to have an argument about this topic, since it does not require to really go into deta|il|s, an*d an opinion i]s justification enough.
These kinds of topics ar)e generally those, who incite most fur=ious, and most futile, debate.
Obviously it w\ill be annoying if a wrong option is chosen, but we will surely reconcile ourselves wit(h i%t.
And, should life fe!el too glum, it always offers a suit[a[ble scapegoat.
Josba foug;ht a narrow away win
Josba's first away game in floorball First Division against Nurmo ’ s Jymy resulted in fu@ll thre}e league poin'ts.
Josba returned home from Seinäjoki with a triu)mphant 6'-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
In t]he beginning o-f t=he third period, Nurmo was still a goal ahead, but Josba experimented with line-ups and rotated players.
In 50.4%7, brothers Eetu a\nd Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted the 6-5 winning goal.
As both teams got penalties, many cru(cial minutes were played with even st.rength.
The most effective Jo+sba player was Juus%o Lehtiniemi (2+1).
The second chain had a good fir'ep'owe'r anyway, as Teemu Tuhka;nen (1+1), Jere Kaartinen (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1+0) al}l scored.
Also Miika Kosonen (1+0) playe{d i]n the second chain when he scored.
A$fter three league rounds, Josba has six points.
The next opponent is O2-Jyväskylä in an a=w=a=y match i{n two weeks.
Eno church celebrates it?s bicentenary on Sunday
Eno church bicentenary is cele<br<ated to-morrow on Sunday, for some part in a very sad atmosphere.
Kiihtelysvaara church arson a week ago wa?s a shock.
Also Eno chu?rch was guarded on the t,wo nights after the fire.
Desp=i=te the pai,n, today is a day of celebration.
Even if noone would want it to be s+o, Eno church is now the oldest church i{n the Joen[s[uu parish union.
The chur:ch on a h`ill in the centre of th/e village has always been the heart of Eno, despite all sorts of municipal and other mergers.
A family service begins at Eno chur(ch at 10 o ’ clock tod)ay.
Af+ter that, a Kare\lia\n banquet table is set at the church hall.
There is a lo[t of different thing/s happening during the day, both inside and out.
It is possible for example to visi#t th(e church building guided by retired sacristan of 37 y,ears, Ari Räsänen.
Church birth celeb(ration also is an en^d of an era.
The church hall, b/ui/lt in 1982 and already taken out of use, wil*l keep its doors open for the last t.ime today.
Currently we have t|emporary facilities at the old municipal h.a.ll, chaplain Markku Kostinen says.
Th]e church hall was destroyed by indoor a.i.r problems, but t~h~e church has been healthy in place for already 200 years.
El)on Musk steps down as cha|irm|an of the board for Tesla - Fraud charges settled with $40 million
El%ectric car manufacturer Tesla and the company ’ s CE@O Elon Musk ha)ve settled their case with the Securities and Exchange Commission SEC, who regulate the U.S. sec,urities industry.
SEC suspected Musk to be guilty o`f a securities fraud, and M%us%k was in danger to be r.emove.d from the management of the company he founded.
However, Musk is a`llowed to continue a<s Tesla CEO.
Instead, Musk has t#o step down for three years as chairma?n of the board for Tesla.
The company ha[s to hire an outside chairman.
M&usk will also be under stricter supervision.
According to th+e settlement, Tesla will have to app-oint tw\o independent directors and oversee Musk ’ s communications in the future.
In a)ddition, both Tesla and Musk have to pay $2'0 million (ca . 17 million euro) to settl!e the case.
‘ The resolut=ion is int<ended to prevent further market disruption a@nd harm to Tesla ’ s shareholders ’, says SEC co-director Steven Peikin.
The case began in Augus?t, when Musk tweeted that he could take Tesla priva:te.
He al\so wrote that funding has been secured.
This tweet ca\use\d Tesla ’ s st)ock price to rise temporarily.
SEC suspect~ed Musk guilty of a securities fraud.
Acc`ording t\o SEC, the tweet was false an!d misleading, and Musk had not discussed the deal with the company ’ s other directors or potential financing partners.
In practice, SEC charge;d Musk with misleading the in^ve^stors.
On F"riday, SEC announced it is going to sue th=e company and Musk.
SEC to?l?d it is seeking to impose fines on Musk and to ban him from being a,ble to hold off[icer or director positions at publicly-traded companies.
SEC ’ s summons scared the investors, and Tesla's sh$ar$e took a nose!di!ve.
O/ver 800 peo(pl(e died in an earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia
The death toll from Ind=on=esia's quake and tsunami disaster has soared to a)t least 832, the disaster agency said according to news age%ncy AFP.
The number of deaths i#s believed to gro~w higher, since the investigation of damages is till ongoing.
Vice Presi/d/ent Jusuf Kalla predicts the dea'th toll could reach into the thousands.
An earthquake on Friday trig"gered a tsunami that surged over the Palu city in the island o?f Sulawesi.
A warning about a tsunami was issued right after the quake, but i+t was quickly canc,e,lled.
According to of/ficia/l/s, nearly all the known deaths are at least s+o far from Palu.
The rescue officials are worried about the Donggala ar%ea close to the quake ce.ntre, where the s|ituation is for the most part unclear.
Already now several people are kno:wn to have died.
Cries of help from t=he ruins
The Indonesian army has been cal}led to aid the r(e(scue workers in searching for victims.
P)resident Joko Widodon, who arrived in the destruction area today, asked the troops to be ready t[o work day a)nd night.
One of th*e focus points of t:he rescue work is a Palu hotel, the ruins of which are suspected t(o still hold 50 to 60 people.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of the national Search and Rescue Agency managing the rescue work, said that one people has been pulled out alive from th!e ruin+s of Roa-Roa hotel, popul^ar with business trave'llers.
We also heard p^eople calling for help, he s_ai_d.
Syaugi said heavy lifting equipment is now quickly needed in the quake and tsu$nami a@rea.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook an.d other social media in order to find their missing fa+mily and friends.
Help, you i'n Palu and nearby.
My friend ’ s family members are still missing, one of the write#rs pleaded in a Facebook grou,p.
Politicians ’ phone numbers leaked to trou]blemak]ers in Britain
Many British politicians were sub|jected to nuisance after their personal details were leaked because o\f an app security flaw.
The trouble$m$akers h_a_d access to e.g . Ministers ’ phone numbers.
T"he app in question was a mobile application used for Britain ’ s Conservatives ’ p|arty conference.
For exa-mple Brexiteers Mic`h`ael Gove, Secretary for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were among tho_se targeted for disturbance.
Several ministers received nuisance c#alls.
Because of a security flaw, members o#f th~e public were able to access the politicians profiles in the Conservative party annu{al conference ’ s mobile application.
They could enter the pro{files using a politician ’ s email address, which is widely available o>n>li>ne.
The person entering a profile c$ould view and edit t`he data stored within.
F*or a bri/ef moment, someone managed to swap Boris Jo{h{nson's profile picture for pornography and change his job title to a libellous one.
Michael Gove ’ s picture was changed to on*e o^f media tycoon Rupert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a columnist f#o#r The Guardian described the proble}m by writing that the conference app allows one to l~og in as other people with their email address.
After that it is possible to view the contact details in a person ’ s profile an/d, for example, s@end messages as th~em.
The conference app essentially made every journalist, p[olitician and attendee ’ s mobile number public, Foster crit\icis\ed.
A Conservative party spokes"person apologised for the breach.
They sai+d the technical issue h,as been resolved and the app now functions securely.
The Information Commissioner's O'ffice ICO investigates the breach.
The application was created by an Aust`ralian Crowd Comm;s company.
Opposition party Labour criticises the Conservative party saying they cannot be truste\d in security issu|es.
The Wall Finland quiz show's audience has a huge number o-f applauding Poles every w%eek
T\he sharp-eyed viewers paid attention to the studio audience reactions in The Wall Finland quiz s#how.
The American television format The Wall has spread quickly worldwide, and its F)inn)ish version arriv%e%d at channel Nelonen las.t Saturday.
Hos,ted b|y Heikki Paasonen, the game show ha+s been filmed in Poland in the same studio, where the other international productions of the format are made.
The shooting possibilities o+f the studio in Poland ar#e exceptional, because the format's tall, 12-metre game wall requires a gener%ous space.
During the opening episode, social medi;a highlighted the sho^w ')s studio audience, which people guessed to be Polish.
There was a Twitter discussion abo%ut whether the possible Poles sitting in the studio understand anything ab)out the game p|layed in Finnish.
Unne Sormunen, managing director of Finnish programmes at Ne`lonen, ex%plains the issue to Iltalehti.
She says the studio audience consist?s of the players ’ close friends, other Fi>nns, expatriate Fi\nns living in Poland, and Polish viewers.
Th$e Finnish production audience consists of i`nte`rnatio`nal applauders, just like the audiences o)f other countries ’ The Wall episodes, filmed in the same production space.
Final@d also has these groups, the so-called professional audiences th`at visit different programmes ’ shoots, Sormunen explaines.
She reminds people that following the game is not s}o d*iffic*ult to understand, even i#f one does not understand the language it is played in.
It is easy to separate the red and g/r/een b*alls falling from the wall.
However, there are interpreters present i~n the studio to translate for those speaking a foreign languag,e.
There are t{wo interpret_ers who interpret simultaneously everything that happens to the studio floor manager.
The manager then gives instructions to the audience and describes for example what k+inds of jokes people are tell?ing and what is the current situation, So_rmunen says.
She compares the si<tuation wit/h how things were done recently with David Hasselhoff in a Finnish production.
Some years ago, Dav<id Hasselhoff was involved in Talent Finland filming here in Fi"nla"nd.
He ha^d a continuous simultaneous interpretation coming to h)is earbud the whole time, and he kn}ew everything that was said in Finnish, Sormunen summarises.
A typhoon that batt/ere/d the southern parts of Japan proceeds towards th\e main islands - official warn abou=t landslides and flooding
Officials also war;n about possible landslides and flooding.
A_t least 50 people have been injured i@n typhoon Trami, but t~he official say t?h?e?re have been no major injuries and there is no information so far about fatalities.
In the southern island of Okinawa, the winds wer"e so strong they upended car]s.
According to Japan Broadcasting Corpo^ration people have be[e[n evacuated to sh[elters, and there are over 300,000 households without electricity.
Over a thousand flights have been cancelled, and high]-speed trains have in places come to a standstill be%cau%se of the sto;rm.
The storm is ecpec$ted to hit near Osaka a/ro/und noon Finnish time.
The capital Tokyo is not directly on the path of the sto!rm, but stro$ng winds and rain have been promised there, to_o.
Trains have been cancelled in Tokyo to(day.
According t}o me]teo]rologist, Trami will continue to torment Japan until Monday.
The sky gets even cloudi>er for Ässät
The beginning o|f the season ha<s been a bad one for Ässät.
The situation is already almost pitch black, as t,he team lost to Vaa(sa Sport on their home ground by 3 g*oa*ls . T`he final score was 3-6 (0-2, 0-3, 3-1).
The Pori tea/m now has had five consecutive losses, and a point total of two fr(om six games.
None of the defensemen o.r players from two lower strings of th_e team has made a goal.
And the pressure keeps bu%ildi%ng.
When p>l>aying against Sport, the crowds started to leave the hockey arena already when there was still a)bou)t half o-f the game left.
We ’ ve only played six games, and there ’ s no re;ason to give u%p.
We h.ave to be worrie`d though, since our game was that bad.
Especially performance during second period was shame-fully bad, describes Ja^rn^o Kärki, who made 1+2 points for Ässät.
Sport naturally enjoyed their vict@ory.
The team had a previous game on Friday, so that could have had a{n effect on thei\r playing.
And maybe it did, but Ässät ju(st didn ’ t manag&e to capitalise on it.
Bread d|ay visitor number continued to grow
T&he mother of Bread Day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, marvels at th&e attendance in the big hall's auditorium.
Somehow I thought there would perhaps not be t|ha|t m>a>n>y people this year, Hyvärinen thought in the morning.
In the autumn of 2017, Bread Day was org;ani;sed at the same time with F%inni%s%h plowing cont+est, so maybe the expectation wa%s that the attendance could even go down from the year before.
But unlike expectations, the aisles were crowded alre\ady be~fore ten, the sellers said their products were sol{d out, new crop porridge was sold mo.re than last yea@r, nearly 500 portions, and Hyvärinen heard there had also been a rise in the number of cars.
The attendance estimate has been about 6,000, Hy?värinen says l!ater in the afternoon.
During the five hours in the morn&in&g and afternoon, the programme had especially many things for families with children, whic;h prob_ably was the reason why there was a record nu|mber of them present.
Hyvärinen also estimated the event reach'es people from even fur|ther distances.
Every year, the sellers also come to Liperi fro;m a larger are_a.
This year, there w-e-re nearly a hundred sa=les representatives, handicraft, pastry, and harvest product sellers i}n the bread parish.
The mother of Bread Day, Pirkko H#yväri#nen, marvels at the attend>ance from the hall auditorium.
The Bread Day be&gan with a harvest blessing.
Te<ija Kiviniemi's beautiful bread won the pub<lic vote in the children's category.
There were 11 breads of varying shapes in the children ’ s bre-ad compe"tition.
The winner of the rye bread competition, Marjatta Vepsäläinen, spen't the day at the Martha organisat}io}n's pastry worksh@op.
7 most beautiful lights - this i#s how you recognise a goo@d lamp
Bring the space t%o life, create an appro^p^r^iate atmosphere to the decor, and read a book without tirin]g your eyes.
It is worthwhile to invest in go]o]d lighting.
We colle'cted three good reasons to investi in lighting.
The ti-ps cam=e from Innolux Director of Sales and Marketing Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favour to yo$u$r eyes
The importance o(f lighting grows together with age.
Sufficient light can help in those problems many people get when the)y age, as visual acuity decreases and more and mor{e suffer from gla%res.
As one ge$ts older, also the need for lig"ht grows.
A person in their sixties re;quires three times the light than a person i}n their twenties.
I_t is worthwhile investing in the therapeutic ef;fects of light and in lamp qualities already for health reasons.
A good lamp gives enough light but doesn't cause glares, Jok!iniemi gives t[ips.
Crea'te beauty around you
A beautiful decor is brought out only w}ith suitable l=ight solutions.
Modern home decorator has plenty to cho*ose from.
A subdued japandi style combining S%ca%ndin%avian an]d Japanese things is currently popular.
On the other hand, also t\he mode#rn and playful retro style drawing inspiration from the 70s has had a boom i,n popularity, with its different metallic tones and i/ce/cream colours.
Authenticity charms i{n the same way it does in o}th}er house decor.
The mate[rials now include wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leather, and bam|boo.
Express yo)ur personality
Peopl(e invest in their homes much more than before, and de]cor has became a way to express one ’ s per[s[onality.
Instead of m^ass production, peo!ple want to have a tailored, even a bold lamp that ha{s a story to tell.
People are clearly looking for Finnish a^nd Nordic products wi(th a well-known origin and designer.
They are very design-aware, Jokiniemi sa?ys.
One does not necessarily buy the most r&e&c&ent trendy la%mp to one ’ s home, but rat'her a timeless classic one has saved many years for.
Certain kinds of timeless, jewel-like, ele'gan't classics hang on from year to year, Jokiniemi say~s.
Th:an:ks and goodbye!
KooKoo showed the do_or to their Canadian forwa~r~d after three matches
Th:e ways parte|d for KooKoo and forward Brendan O ’ Donnell.

Pelimies wants to show exam(ple in recycli}ng - the merchandise is shipped in recycled boxes, plastic gave wa+y to paper
Pelimies, a sh!op specialising in games, nowadays r.ec.yc.les not only games but also packaging materials.
B)ric)k and mortar shop customers ’ items are no longer packed i#n plastic bags, but in paper bags made fro/m recycled material.
It=ems purchased via web store are packed fo*r example in packaging that has come from the importers.
A~ll the arriving packages are reused.
We may us&e the boxes about te~n times, as long as the package is in usable condition, Ville Puurula fr-om Pelimies Oulu says.
As padding materi~al, the company mainly uses newspapers and other like r>ecyc>l>ed material.
We avoid bubble wr<a<p as much as possible.
In the near future we plan t[o switch over to recycled material also with en}velopes.
The company wants to b;e an example fo$r others, too.
According to Puurula, recycling caus}es no additional trouble.
It's n(ot a big problem to begin recycling.
I't will also bring saving<s, when for example pasteboard packages are reused.
Recycling fits na>turally in Pe]limies ’ operations, because in addition to new products, the shop's primary range of products include for example secondha?nd games and devices.
A mu_st buy for every fashionista: A on/e and the same shirt works with every outfit
Classic clothes work from season to seas]on, in any out)fit.
With their versatility t&he&y create a good basis for a wardrobe, because it is easy to ass#emble different outf!its around quality classics even inexpensively.
In the autumn, the most used wardrobe classic{s includ[e high-quality knits.
A black turtleneck belong.s to this category.
Black sweater with a turtleneck, ma$de from natural mater>ials can ’ t be a wrong purchase.
The garment can be combined with trousers, tull}e sk*irt as well a+s with jeans, and it's possible to create a style that is either subdued o$r striking around it.
A turtleneck sweater f#i#ts both a youthful, modern dresser and a classically e-lega-nt master of style.
This is how to create th~e style.
This a+utumn ’ s trendy look is created wi$t$h golden brown, fl,ared trousers, a black turtle neck, and grey ankle boots.
A cla=ssic turtleneck together with other classics, a blue and green plaid skirt and wine red loafers form a fem&i&n&ine and elega"nt outfit.
Give a black turtl-eneck an edge by combining it with casually trendy garmen"ts: a denim skirt, hi=gh boots, and thick tights.
Youthf[ul and stylish!
Russian intelligence services ’ sabotage activities have a l>ong tradition
There i)s no reason t%o suppose that the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Feder#ation (SVR) or The Main Directorate of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation (GRU) wo]uld have abandoned this mod*e of operation.
During Soviet times, s%o called DR#G groups specialised in sabotage activities.
The name comes from R(u(ssi(an words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage an-d intelligence group.
T{he agents of Soviet security service KGB working in western countries prepared detailed plans for important sabotage targets, says KGB archivist Vas]il]i Mitrokhin (1922-200:4) who defected to th}e West.

T/r/ue story on T:V today: A climber left to die twice
American Beck Wathers wrot_e a book 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home From Everest is b&ased on the m)an's own experiences.
Tonight ’ s movie is based o@n them.
Everest has its premiere in Finnish TV n"ow.
In May 1996, climbers on Mount Everest we$re overtaken b|y a disastrous snowstorm.
Baltasar Kormákur ’ s 2015 di(rect(ion tells about the fight for survival that has been covered ple@nty of times.
The:re have b>een previous films - and documents - about the tragedy.
The real ev^ents are looked through also in this ar}ti}cle.
2#2 years ago, the world's highest mount/ain took the lives of eight climbers.
Two o+f the{m were experienced expedition leaders: Scott Fischer and Rob Hall.
It was precisely H[al[l, who wa]s Weathers ’ guide.
A;n eye surgery performed just bef\ore his departure to Nepal might have saved Weathers ’ life.
Because of that and the a+ir pressure, h&e lost his eye sight, which meant he had to pass the cl|im|b to the summit.
Rob Hal-l continued t`o climb and didn ’ t return.
However, Weathers ’ life-and-death struggle h$ad on"ly just begun.
As the storm blew up, h\e got lost an.d did}n ’ t find his way back to the camp.
When people came to look for th|e man, they found him in such a bad condition that they didn ’ t beli$e$ve he would surviv%e.
Weathers was l=eft to die.
As if by a miracle, he s/till managed to find her feet and find the o_t_hers.
Weathers was badly frostbitten, so they still though he was dying, and once again he was left t;o his o/wn de~vices.
It is obviou/s that agai>nst all expectations, Beck Weathers survived.
At some point, also his fellow climber@s began to be,lieve in his chances t|o such an extent they helped him.
The film features Josh Brolin a's Beck Weathers,
Jason Cla%r%ke a#s Rob Hall, and Jake Gyllenhaal as Scott Fisher.
Oth.e.r roles feature for example Robin Wright, Kei%ra Knightley, and Emily Watson.
Eno ch=u=rch bicentenary has been celebrated today
The 200-year-old church of Eno ha:s been cele;brated within the church precinct today.
The church was opened on 4th O#ctober 1)818, and to celebrate the anniversary, a celebration for the whole family was organised on Sund~a~y.
At then o ’ clock the celebration began within the church precinct w,it,h a family service, after which a Karelian banquet table was set a^t Eno ch'urch hall.
The ch\urch was full.
517 people t{ook part in the family service.
En-o vicar Armi Rautavuori was happy that people showed u?p in the church in such great numbers.
It will be a great joy fo_r a long time y$et and gives energy for my work, Rautavuori (in th$e picture) says.
T#he Kiihtelysvaara church fire has resona;ted with many, and it was not ignored in t'he Eno church bicentenary celebration.
Eno church i\s now t?he oldest among Joensuu Evangelic Lutheran parishes after Kiihtelysvaara church was destroyed in a fire.
Kiih$tely$sv$aar$a wooden church was completed in 1770.
A prayer meeting was organised a>t Kiihtelysvaara in the morning, whe-re the people calmed down and reminisced t+he church that was destroyed in a fire.
Pictures and videos: A me;dican;e flashed its powers in Greece - the sea disappeared and a street tur$ned into a ri"ver
A strong, hurricane-type autumn st;orm rolle&d to Greece from the southwest on Saturday.
A Mediterranea+n hurricane, a medicane, has b;een named Zorba.
The Hellenic National Meteorological Se=rvice issu#ed a red weather warning to areas o'f Attica, Peloponnesus, the Ionian Islands, the Cyclades, and Crete.
Pictures taken from the area show a lo!t of fl<oodi<ng all around Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows, ho-w, instead of a street, a river caused by flooding s:u:dden:ly appeared b?etween houses in t!he town of Kiato located in Corinthia.
Another video shows a car b&eing carried by floodwaters.
In the souther"n part o.f Peloponnesus peninsula a strong wind caused rough seas.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instructed people on its Facebook page to prepa{re for a storm i~n Greece.
The embassy urges people t[o follow weather forecasts a%nd local officials ’ instructions.
A mediterranian hurricane, al\so known a/s a medicane, brings about torrential rains an'd even a threat of flooding.
CNN reports that acc,or,ding to a study published in 2011, only about 1-2 medicanes occur per year, typically during the months of Sep+tember and October, w$hen sea surface temperatures are still q,uit,e warm.
The current sto&rm triggered flash flooding across Tunisia a(nd Libya before moving north over the Mediterranean towards Europe.
A caus,e for concern in Greec|e are the refugee camps on islands, like on Lesbos.
The thousands o#f Syrian and Iraqi refugees living in the camps have limited possibilities of finding proper protect.i.on.
Al.so the areas destroyed by last summer's wildfires ne[ar Athens are under threat.
A medican;e raged in Greece also in last November.
N"o going offshore, the flights still on schedule - there ar&e currently thousands of Finns holidaying in the Gr'eek islands threatened by an autumn gale.
All offshore tours are cancelled, and o]ne should be careful als"o when walking, so that branches or other loose objects flying in the storm d,o n?ot hit one.
During the weekend, t*he guides distributed these kinds of instructions for the about 3,500 Finns holidaying in Gree$k v}ia Aurinkomatkat.
T,he instructions are needed, because according to the forecast, i\t is possible that the Zorba storm battering the Greek isl,ands this weekend can reach even a hurricane l%eve%l.
For example, near the island of Crete, the wi:nd velocity in gusts can rise even up to 45 m&etr&e&s per secon{d.
The rottenness of th>e weather is made worse b,y torrential rains.
According t}o t'our operators, all the people who have given their phone numbers and have travelled with Aurinkomatkat and Tui from Finlan_d to Greece, have been warned about the strong winds wi&t&h a text message.
Still sunny an`d warm
According to Aurinkom]atkat Deputy Communications Manager Inka Ikonen, by Saturday early evening, the holiday resorts have manage"d to av+oid the worst.
For example, the fl=ights have landed and too^k off according to normal schedule.
Naturally w"e are constantly following the situation.
Safety comes fir}st.
T$u$i ’ s Emergency Phone Duty Officer Antonia Schroderus says also their flights hav[e ran on schedule.
We are constantly in contact with our staff in t_he reso-rt.
It was stil;l peaceful at least in Crete, she said early on Saturday eveni(ng.
Tui has currently a little over 1,500 Finnish travellers loc_ated in the most popular Gree*k islands, Rhodes and C~r~ete.
Ad$ditionally, there are some a few hundred travellers staying in sm^aller locations.
For example, the worst storm will most likely reach the is@land of Kos on Sunday morni:ng.
At the same time, Rhodes even saw a bit o_f sun on Saturday afternoon, a`n`d the temperature rose to 27 degrees, s|ays Ikonen from Aurinkomatkat.
I&t is estimated tha<t Zorba will continue to trouble Turkey next, ev-en though it will be slightly eased off.
To prepare for this, we have alrea#dy contacted our staff in Turkey, and for ex$ample checked the number of Finns w#ho ha&ve flown to Antalya with Tui, Schroderus says.

Before the move, Hussi hol!ida!yed alone in Greece.
It w+as lovely, I was at the h|otel for a week without going anywhere.
As my st'ress eased I got a cold, but otherwise t!he holiday was really successful, Hussi says.

Two robot ca<rs to begin operation in Espoo
Th&ey will operate the rest of the year and take passengers, Esp'o'o city reports.
Otaniemi robot cars act as a bus simulator, because the plan is t^o b}egin operation w+ith a robot bus in the area next spring.
The project concerns developing and piloting a year-round robot ve]hicle traffic, and testing the vehicles technical functionali_ty in Finni-sh conditions.
The trial will investigate ho\w r>ob>o>t cars manage with the current street network.
At th:e same time, the city offers robot bus developers a possibility to develop the technology i$n a real enviro|nme|nt, Head of Traffic Management Johanna Nyberg says.
This is th~e first time robot cars ope<rate completely automatically among other traffic without any specific traffic arrangements.
The vehicle safety is on the responsibility of an as-sisting passenger always a^boar^d the vehicle.
The vehicles sense continuously sense their environment with many different sensors, e#valuat#ing i{f the road is unobstructed.
If it is no|t, they deci|pher whether the sensed obstruction i`s a vehicle, a bicycle, or for example a snow flake, says Harri Santamala, CE|O of Sensible 4, the company in charge of developing ro%bot traffic.
The robot cars operate the whole aut-umn three days a week: o%n Tuesdays between 13 and 15.30, Wedne@sdays 10-15, and Thursdays 10-15.
The robot car#s hav/e six stops during their route and they take passengers aboard.
The robot car stops can b(e recognised from t;he stop markings.
The sure+st way to get aboard is from th(e stop number 1 at Otakaari.

P)olic)e supervised hunting in North Karelia and Savolax
Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting supervision together with Metsähallitus a-nd Finnish W]ildli]fe Agency in North Karelia and Savol#ax o}n Friday and Saturday, the hunting contact persons of the police department said in social media on Saturday.
The main emphasis in supervision was th|e legality and permissibility o'f hunting.
Each hunter's game li\cence and hunting permit required on state land were che[cked.
In addition, the hunting gun licences were checked, as well a:s cartridge number o+f automatic weapons used in hunting game bi^rds.
According to the police, 112 hunters were checked during the supervis\ion, an@d only on hunter without a requisite hunting permit was fou:nd.
The hunter was punis*hed with 12 unit fi^ne^s for illicit hunting.
The police also conducted breath t-ests on 133 drivers, and two of them are suspected o:f drink driving.
The patrols also handled five traffic infractions with fine pena}lt}i}es, the police rec\apitulates.
In summary, it ca>n be concluded that h<unters observe hunt permissibility extremely well.
Many hunter)s were surprised by the supervision.
One hunter stated ‘ I have hunted in the area for 50 ye~ars, and this w=as the first time someone check.s the permits ’.
Eastern Finland Police Department c;onti;nues hunting supervision together with other supervision official.s in the autumn.
Mykkäne|n travels to Turkey to observe the sele=ction of Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Interior Kai Mykkänen (National C<o<alition) will travel to Tu*rkey in the next few days to observe the selection of quota refugees coming t}o Finland.
T#his year, it has been decided that Finland will receive 530 Syrians fr_om Turkis refugee camps.
The selection trips are usually done a couple of times per year, with representatives from th=e Finnish Immigration S]ervice, the Ministry of Employment and the Economy, an'd th}e Police.
Currently the delega;tion i"s already in Turkey, conducting interviews.
The United Natio~ns ’ High Commissioner for Refugee>s UNHCR first selects people who are in an especially vulnerable situati_o_n as candidates.
In practice, this means people who are con(sidered to be in an exceptional distress, suc%h a;s single parent families, handica#pped and sick persons, women and children.
There are more people selected to th_e group arriving in Finland than the quota requires, sinc[e in practice some of them will not arrive f.or different reasons.
While i<n Turkey, Minister Mykkänen will also meet Turkish Minister of the Interior, Süleyma:n Soylu, and non-governmental o=r=gani=sations operating on the Syrian border.
Minister Mykkänen w\ill be accompanied by Permanent Secretary Ilkka Sa#lm#i.
Talks abou;t additional quota
Finland has been admitting quota refugees since th`e 1970s.
I#n recent years, the quota has bee.n 750 refugees per year.
For a couple of years, the quota was 1,050 refugees pe}r year, but sin\ce then, the Government has not reached an agreement about a>n increase.
Th_e National Coalition Part%y has supported the quota increase, but the last time, the idea was shut down by the Blue Refo`rm.
P.ri.me Minister Juha Sipilä (Centre) recently proposed the quota to be increased gradually t]o 1,500-2,000 people p+er year.
Mykkänen ’ s vi`s`it is the first one the Minister of the Interior makes t*o observe the selection of quota refugees duri&ng this term of government.
The former Ministers of the Interior, Petteri Orpo (National Coalition) and Paula Risikko (National Coaliti+on), transferred to their new tasks be#fore t"he visits could be arran<ged.
Finland receives a 10,000 euro subsidy f=or every refugee in an especially vul}nerable situation.
Rea&l&ly going off the track now - it ’ s impossible to know whether t*o laugh or cry
Last Saturday Karjalainen reported on t_he legislative proposal to amend t&he Animal Welfare Act.
The article gives an idea that to start with, the proposal prohibits all s(uch animals that have not been s\epa\rately permitted with a minist.erial decree t,o be kept as farmed animals, pets, o%r in other way related to business operations.
So to start with, everything else is p;rohibited except the animals that a(re individually mentioned in the act.
If the proposal ends up as an act, this most likely means we are abandoning a common principle in western democracies that an act separately fo]rbids a(n act{ion that endangers the safety of society or goo`d practices.
Now the proposed provisions essentially forbid all such activities that th-e ac^t or decrees don't separately permit.
Th;e change will result in a situation where nothing new can be tri~ed in for ex>ample business, an|d no other things can be done before an approving act has been adopted or a decree issued.
The government ’ s actions i~n bill drafting in gene+ral have been weak.
If w/e now go down the road that leads to a F(inlan(d where everything is forbidden that is not separately permitted, I don ’ t know an=y more whether to laugh o'r cry.
I don't doubt th?a?t the Animal Welfa#re Act needs an update.
Bu|t stat<ute drafting in this direction is not a part of democracy.
Unfortunately I don't know the Constitution all that well, but I wonder whether it permits this kind of ‘ everything is forbidden i+f i@t's not separately permitted i>n an a_ct or a decree ’ procedure.
I wish there would be a sensible minister to sto}p the progression of statute drafting o"f this kind.
Metti Forsse=l=l gives a t{ip: The four trendiest skirts of the autumn
The trend garment of this a>utum>n comes with a snakeskin pa,tt,ern.
It looks rem/arkably good especially in skirts.
Pair a snakeskin skirt with a subdued top, like a turtleneck o&r a regular t-shirt, to ke?ep the out^fit stylish.
This year there is a lot of silk out the~re, and a silk s(kirt especially is one of the season ’ s trendiest garment=s.
Pa*ir a gorgeous silk skirt elegantly with a feminine top or casually with a kn^it.
You c!an al[so be more playful with a silk skirt, and put on for example trainers o=r this autumn ’ s trend shoes, cowboy boots.
No ma_tte_r whether its gre,y, brown or multicoloured, al*l check skirts are now part of every woman ’ s must have autumn clothes.
Be bold when c!ombining di-fferen-t colours and play with the check pattern also by using tops of different patterns.
For example a combin~ation of check and pol_kadot patterns is beautiful.
Asymmetrical h\ems ar`e a breath of summer ’ s lightness to take along to autumn.
Asymmetrical hem is at the same time b&oth feminine an"d playful, and it fits pe'rfectly both during weekdays and in a parties.

Kimi Räikkönen summed up the rea!son for Mercedes supremacy com~pa~red to Ferrari
Ferrari ’ s Kimi Räikkönen had to admit tha|t the worst rival Mercedes was too t*ou*gh in th/e Russian GP qualifying.
There ’ s n^o reason for panic in the Ferrari camp, the experienced driver e>stimated.
T}he}y just were fas.ter than us, but it's not a huge thing.
So far our ca}r in the qualifying was the best thing the whole weeke\nd, but they jus|t we}re too fast, said Räikkönen, who finished fourth and, together wit!h his team mate Sebastian Vettel, was clearly slower than Mercedes.
Fe~rrari had difficultie[s already in the previous race in Singapore.
Räikkönen was asked wha.t is t+he cause for the sudden drop behind Mercedes.
They se,em t`o go faster than us - that's how simple it is.
If I knew the reason for tha-t, we ’ d proba:bly go as fast as they are going.
However, I d?on't know anymore t`h`a`n anyone else.
Th,is is constant guesswork, and they ap$pear to be in the lead now.
W]h]o knows why?
Räikkönen ’ s future team, Sauber, had a rare treat i'n the qualifyin|g.
Charles Leclerc, who replaces Räikkönen at Ferrari next season, was seve|nth, and Marcus Ericsson also man?ag?ed to make it to the final qualifying se:s:sion.
The tenth position is the best o&ne the Swedish driver has had i_n over three years.
A/nd even if there were as many as five drivers not participating in the second session, the end re/sult was still delicious for S]auber.
And perhaps encouraging for Räikkönen, considering the ne/xt s#ea#son.
Yes, if you compare to where they were in the beginning of th%e season, the ste@p forw-a-rd has been a huge one.
Nex(t ye+ar there will be a different story, so we ’ ll see, we ’ ll see.
That was it - Robert Helenius knocked o"ut Erkan Te{per: ‘ Robbe is back ’
A match between Robert Helenius and Erkan Teper p"rogessed in an even manner in t/he Stuttgart night.
The German had more initiative in the ring, b;ut he didn ’ t manage to land goo{d hits.
Helenius has a significantly wider reach and contro!l!led the ma+tch with his hard series of punches that fo@und their way in well.
The Finn also wa}s obviously in a better physical condition than T_eper.
The resolve finally came in the eighth ro}und, as Helenius knocked Teper o\ut with his left cross.
The punch was so hard the vete|ran, who was fighting in front of a home cro<w<d, didn ’ t e}v}en try to get up from the mat.
Aft[er victory wa.s confirmed, Helenius ’ celebration was quite calm.
In the ring interview he first com*plime*nted the good atmosphere created by the audienc>e and his opponent.
Then he c#hang#ed into Finnish for a moment.
Thank you for all t)he spectators and Finnish supporters.
We took the belt with u's today.
Helenius rejoiced right af:ter the match.
From th"e perspective of Helenius ’ car%eer, this was a really big win.
There m[igh[t even be a possibility to go to a world championship match, Helenius com;mented to Iltalehti before th>e match.
A defea%t, on the other h$and, might've ended his whole boxing career.
Of course I've thought about i,t.
I ’ m not getting any younger, 34-year.-.old Helenius admitted befo)re meeting Teper.
Number o~f Indonesian disaster victims can multiply
According to The Guardian, the vice president of the countr.y warns about a clear rise in t^he numbe}r of victims.
The vice president o[f t;he country, Jusuf Kalla, says the death toll can reach thousands.
Dif!fi!cult circumstances
The rescuers look for those trapped in the ruins and also f-or the d,ead i~n the Sulawesi areas that have suffered worst: Harbour city o&f Palu and its neighbouring city of Donggala.
So far all the victims ar}e from Palu, there is no certainty of Don<gga<la situation.
H?und?reds of peop{le are missing and about 540 are badly injured.
There are still people trapped i.n the ruins of collapsed buildings, and the rescuers have not yet been ab>le t>o get out.
For example, ho;tel Roa Ro`a in Palu has collapsed.
Th/e rescuers say they have heard trapped people crying from the rui.ns, but a lack of heavy clearing equipment has del%a%yed rescue work.
Indonesian president Joko Widodo has ordered the tro)ops t}o help in rescue and clearing work.
There is a need fo_r army and its equipment, because electricity and communications links are down in many plac-es in the disaster ar}e}a.
Also fuel reserves are running sh#ort.
Miss F;inland finalist ’ s hesitant a/ns/wer and long consideration caused roars of laughter
New Miss Finland is curr_ently being chosen at Billnäs Ruu]kk]i.
E<a<ch beauty finalist wa_s asked a question during the interview round.
The fina)lists drew a question from a gl%ass bowl on a table.
The hesitant answer of especially finalist number six, 23-year-old Emilia Anttikoski, brough\t about a hearty but benevolent laughter i.n the audi-e-nce.
Question that wa(s posed to Anttikoski came through Facebook.
User Pirkko-Ella wanted to know wh`at is th\e last book the finalist has read.
Anttikoski considered her answer for q^ui^te a while, before she hesitantly beg_an:
Thank yo)u for your question, Pirkko-Ella.
The l}ast book I ’ ve read i&s..., Anttikoski said pondering.
H,er pause for consi~deration caused roars of laughter in the audience, until Anttikoski continued:
The last book I ’ ve re[ad is ...
I've read books in sch:ool!
Probabl*y something related to economics.
So the last boo:k I ’ v?e read is something about economics, Anttikoski answered.
After h|er answer, Anttikoski received resounding applauds from the audience, accompanied by laugh[ter.
Earlier during th$e Miss Finland tour Anttikoski attracted attention because she didn ’ t want to pose in j*ust und]erwear on account of her principles.
Miss Finland 2018 will be c(hosen at 9 pm, wh/en l^ast year ’ s Miss Finland Michaela Söderholm resigns the title.
Sikke's apple and p~ear cake is delectable
This is a recipe for you, who have y$our own good, sour apples, because Finnish apples ar,e dreadfully expensive in the sho>p.
Pe:ars you mi*ght have to buy, even though many might already have a pear tree growing, too.
It is possible to make this cake jus=t fr(om apples, if you don't want to buy pears.
Obviously the flavour is more div&erse, if y]ou also invest in a pear.
P-ee-l the apples an#d the pear, remove the cores.
Slice the_m.
Me'l't the butter in a pan.
Bea)t the eggs a+nd sugar into a froth, then add corn flour and melted butter.
Combine cornstarch, i.e . maizena, and baking powder, and add those t$o t?he batter.
Add almond f%lour and wheat flour, mix well.
Line a bread pan with baking sheet p|aper, sprinkle tw;o tablespoons o}f sugar on the bottom of t/he pan, and spread pear slices on top of the sugar.
Spoon half of the batter on t"op of pear slices a~nd sp*read the apple slices on top of the batter.
Spoon the rest of the batter o+n top of the apple slice;s.
Bake in an oven in 180 degrees fo:r about an hour, until the sur\face is nicely brown.
Le{t cool in the p#an and then remove to a platter.
Do not cut th.e cake until i}t ’ s properly cooled.
Th=e cake structure is fragile and easily crumbled, because the batter contains gluten free almond a|nd corn flours.

Status symbols d>o not attract friends - Four facts about p#opular#i#ty
What makes a person popular, charismatic or adm(ired?
Sydney University researchers analy-s-ed the matter, and outlined two types of ‘ coolness ’ consisting of slightly different characteristics: ge/nera/ll/y attractive coolness an-d i;ts partial counterpart, dissident coolness.
According to re/searchers, attractively coo\l people had man>y socially desired characteristics: they were extroverted, friendly, conciliatory, and competent.
The dissidents, on the othe,r hand, w-ere typically dis>tant, independent, rebellious, and had an edge to their personality.
They cr;aved for experiences and cared lit(t(le for outsiders ’ evaluations.
Bot]h types had good self-esteem and steady emotional life in commo\n.
Tough role i,s not cool in the long run: high status duri]ng teenage years does not necessarily le#ad to success later in life.
This is reported in an American study published i@n Ch{ild Development journal in 2014.
Young people who started dat|ing early, partied, gravitated towards good-looking group,s, and wanted to be popu{lar, a,s young adults had a bigger risk of substance use and straying into crime.
They managed t(heir relationships w[o[rse than their once more unnoticeable peers.
Lu_xury cars, designer bags or watches signifying high statu/s do not make a person cool - o`r at least not genuinely attractive company.
In a research p`ubli`s`hed in So#cial Psychological and Person?ali?ty Science in August, most of the people were more willing to befriend a person dressed in a high-street shirt than in a designer label shirt - even though most people chose t(o wea-r a designer s.hirt for the introductory situation.

A storm i.s about to hit th-ere - a weather forecast is screaming red
During the weekend, the rainf_all in southern Greece may be equal to the average amount o+f rain in Finland during s#ix months.
Zorba s@tor@m will hit Greece during the weekend.
Be prepare\d if you are staying in the area of Pelopo'nnesus, the I[onian Islands, the Cyclades or Crete.
The storm will be v*ery strong, so the Finnish Embassy in Athens reports abou{t it on its Facebook pag)e.
According to the Embassy, the Hellenic National Meteorological Service has issued a re!d weather warning to these area&s.
The on>coming storm i$s also told about in weather service Foreca ’ s blog.
Accordin`g to it, the strongest winds can be u;p to 45 metres per second.
By way of compar;ison, the Kuisma storm that lashed Finland early in the week bl?e?w ab.out 31 metres per second at its height.
According to t)he blog, the biggest concern of Zorba sto{r{m i$s not the wind though, but the heavy rain.
T-h-er-e can b.e up to 300 mm rainfall in the southern Greece during the weekend.
Th`is is equivalent o,f about a half of Finnish annual rainfall.
Weather service S"ever"e Wea;ther Europa has shared a video about the storm development on its Facebook page.
Earlier this week, the Zorba s/to/rm has caused flooding in Tunisia a*nd Libya.
Do you recognise Anku from Love Island Finland, drooled over b*y me[n?
Appears o'n confusing YouTube videos
Not many know that the beauty Anku, dro;oled over by men in Love Island Fi+nla+nd show, also appears as a craft lady on odd YouT%ube videos publi)shed in 2010.
On thes@e videos, Anku advises the crafters for example how to bui!l!d an octopus out of a*n old kitchen paper roll.
In her sympathe!ti!c style, Anku also s[how[s how to make a hedgehog with real, growing spikes from old pair of tigh}ts.
Now it ’ s time to grow Easter grass, but w(e ’ ll do it in slightly surpising a way, Anku hints and p&resents saw d\ust, tights, and g@rass seeds to make the hedgehog.
You can see the videos be%low or fro_m Anku ’ s YouTube channel here.
Valtt>eri Bottas was shaking and bursting with ad<renaline in Sochi - w:i:ll he have to be Hamilton ’ s aid on Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas w/a/s still shaking dozen>s of minutes after his pole position-worthy drive, standing in front o#f the media.
A great lap left behind Mercedes number one star, Lewis Hamilton, a>nd was n@o doubt important al:s:o mentally for the Finnish driver, who has gathered his sha]re of criticism this season.
A nice l(a(p.
I don ’ t know what happened to Lewis when h#e did not finish the decisive l-ap.
It feels good, I ’ m st|il|l shaking a bit, Bottas c|l|a|r|i|fied.
I ’ ve had only one pole position this year, i+n Austria (in midsummer), so quite a bit o\f ti:m:e has passed.
This c:ircuit has been good to m.e in the past, and again I had some good laps.
It's not easy to o]verta]ke at Sochi circuit, so t=h=e start plays an especially large role.
A-nd naturally Bottas had to reply to a question whether he '"s driving for victory tomorrow or whether he has to assist Hamilto}n, who is cl|o|se to reaching the championship title.
My goa)l to the race i+s definitely trying to win.
When you have a pole position at the start, it really is the only goa\l, Bottas st=ates.
B>ut a&s a team, we fight for both championships.
Lewis ’ lead to Sebastian Vettel is qui@te big, and t-he gap between him and me is v,e,ry big, so I have to bear that in mind.
We ’ l`l see wha,t happens, Bottas added, though.
After t;he qualifying, Hamilton w~as genuinely happy about Bottas ’ success, and also Mercedes team bo=ss Toto Wolff was pleased.
Lewis meant to win Valtteri, but h'e didn ’ t su,cce,e,d in the seventh turn.
Valtteri knows he h-as to give everything he has to win Lew`is.
An&d he was so charged that adrenaline was bursting f)rom his ears, Wolff enthused.
Wolff was evasive when answering a question about whether th\e team will allow Bottas and Hamilton to d$rive fairly.
We're going t]o have the conversation tomorrow morning and th,en see how the race is going to pan ou]t.
Erno Kinnunen from Ki>tee won the Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Rally Championship se:ries had a rare ending.
Hardly ever h)ave brothers ended up as Finnish champions at the sa%me time.
Now Eeri*k and Henrik Pietarinen from Tuusula achieved that in the final rally driven in Salo-Turku area, as Eerik won the SM (FRC) 1 an[d Henr%ik SM (FRC) 2 c/lass.
Erno Kinnunen from Kitee ensured the best achievement of h]is career, a-s the third place in the fi_nal rally clinched his Finnish championship in the two-wheel drive c[ars ’ SM (FRC) 4 class.
Competing with a Honda Civic, Kinnunen and navigato;r Ville Mäkelä began the Turku event wit~h p-a-tience, since the starting points were clear: a posi(tion in the leading group would guarantee the title.
In the darkness of Friday evening, the pair ha.d t(o give others a handicap, when part of their additional headlamps betrayed them in the second sp@ecial stage.
W]e were pretty blind for a third stretch.
You can't fuss ar{ound i:n a situation like that.
On Saturday we just f>ollowed behind Jussi Teppo, who was second in th(e series, Kinnunen said.
S}yria demands the United States, France, and Turkey to wit)hdraw their troops
The Syrian foreign mini"ster demands the United States, Fran!ce, and Turkey to withdraw their troops from Syria.
Speaking for the United Nations General Assembly o.n Saturday, Forei\gn Minister Walid Muallem says the foreign troops must leave Syri&a immediately and without any stipulations.
Muallem said the f<oreign troops are in Syria to fight terrorism, and according t'o him, the war again&st terror is ‘ almost over ’.
In his UN address, Muallem also invited Syrian refugees t@o r=etu=rn to home country.
There is, howeve+r, no end in sight f'or the war of past seven years.
Over 360,000 people have died i$n the war.
O#n Friday, Chancellor Merkel sai/d in Germany that a Syria meeting has been pla`nned for October, and in addition to herself, t|he presidents of France, Russia, and Turkey would participate in it.
Not quite Supe;r Bowl, but tens of millions of Americans watched the Supreme Co#urt Justice drama from the television
Judge Brett Kavanaugh, nominee for the Supr[eme Court, and professor Christ_ine Blasey Ford, who accuses him o`f sexual assault, gathered exceptionally many people in front o_f their television sets.
The Supreme Court Justi}ce nomination drama tha*t is at full throttle in the United States gathered at least 20 million people i'n front of their televisions on Thursday.
Th{at is when Kavanaugh, nominated by Donald Trump, a-nd Californian professor Blasey F*ord, who accuses him of harassment, appeared in front of the S%enate Judiciary Committee.
According to preliminary results, the six main channels ABC, CBS, CNN, FO^X News, MSNBC, a{nd NBC ha}d a total of 20.4 million viewers during t-h-e hearing broadcast.
In ad/d/ition, there were several million following the hearing o<nline.
According t"o NBC, 6.8 million people followed their liv+e stream, and CNN reported its record of the year with 8.2 m=illion live broadcast launches.
CNN number rises to over 10 million, when people following the b(r(oa(dcast via YouTub=e and F-aceboo-k are counted in.
Also Fox News D\igi\tal reached 8.0 million launches.
Digital launches are reported by t~he channels themselves, TV viewer numbers come from research and data anal&ysis co"mp"any Nielsen.
Nielsen publishes t(he final numbers on Monday, but they are anyway going t_o be huge.
2?0 million viewers reached by few
Normally viewer ratings o+f over 20 mill)ion are reached only by sports matc(hes, big Oscar and Emmy galas of the entertainment world, and occasional political events such as president"ial speeches, and, in 2016, als!o presidential election debates.
The annual most viewed show of the United St|ates, NF~L final match Sup|er Bowl is still far away, though.
This year, Super Bow;l on N&BC channel gathered about 103 million people in front of their screens.
According to Nielsen, las=t year Trump's first sp`eech to the Congress was watched by a total of nearl{y 48 million people, and his in'a'uguration by more than 30 million people.
Matter of to`p importance
Appointment as a justice to the Supreme Court is a,n extremely significant occasion, since it i%s a lifetime tenu-re.
Trump already got to appoint one new justice, when Antonin Scalia passed away i<n earl|y 2016, an,d the Republicans managed to stop the then president Barack Obama from a=ppoi=nti=ng his follower.
Another place became open when judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, announce.d thi|s year he is going to retire.
Ken(nedy was appointed by the Republican President Ronald Reagan, but i%n many questions he wa&s the so-called swing vote, w&ho could decide the position of the court of nine.
He supported abortion rights and rights of th+e sexual minorities, and his vote w{as decisive in 2015, when gay couples nationwide r-eceived a right to marry.
Kavanaugh i"s considerably more conservative in his views.
Hi's appointment to the Supreme Court may secure the Conservative dominance f\or decades.
Children have a right to let their par]e]nts se@e their information
Only the parents of children under 10 y#ears s_ee their children's health information in the Kanta service.
It i,s a big problem, it is wr/ong, and it is odd.
Originally th:e situation in the Kanta service was even more worrying: the p&arent&s could not see the babies ’ medical r;ec;ords or prescriptions.
In autumn 2016, t[he situation was fixed for under the 10-year-olds with an amendment described a's temporary
After that, there have been promises to fix th[e practices, bu#t the fixing has taken astonishingly long.
Now a fi}x i!s on the way - in 2020.
Since the problem is an expli.cit on.e, changing the la`w basis should not have been anything more than an open-and-shut case.
After that, ac^cording t=o a layperson ’ s understanding, it is simply about pressing a button: now the w$ire is clo>s>ed, so let's open it.
Naturally a child can show their infor@m@ati@on to the parents - if the child has banking user identifiers or an offici[al ide(nt(i(ty card.
But h:ow many 10-year-olds have those?
An identity card is not fre#e, and a 10-year-old can ’ t e*ven get banking identifiers.
So basically i`t is impossible for anyone t:o see a primar;y school fourth-former ’ s records without asking them to be printed out.
It ’ s not that much a)bout the parents ’ rights than abo(ut the children ’ s rights.
It is essential t(o a child ’ s care that pare~nts can be involved.
Obviously it's important t.o t~ake care of the teenager ’ s right to privacy.
Even minors can hav"e family situations, where not al!l things can be freely discussed.
Often they are related t<o sexual health, and taking care of it freely is a deeply meaningful huma/n righ,t.
In the United States, the FBI bega>n to unwrap the harassment allegations against K>ava>naugh
Accordin.g to American media, FBI is in?v?estiga?ting harassment allegations by at least two women.
Earlier t`his w=eek, one of the women was heard by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
Kavanaugh had denied the accusations concerning alleged sexual harass>me>nt during i;n his student days.
The United States Preside.nt Donald Trump ordered the FBI to investig/ate t|he allegations on request by the Senate Judiciary Committee.
The investigation must n-ot take more than a week.
According to Washington Post, the ongoing investigation is a report more restricted than a criminal investigation, and it m>a>y not be}co}me avai&lab&le to the public.
A m}an threatened to kill police officers at Kajaani pol%ice station
An apprehended brawler conti|nue|d protesting even at the station.
The police sa<y they to"ok the man in police custody to ‘ calm down ’.
The police was subjected to a suspe%cted attackers threat in Kajaani during the night between Frid)ay and Saturday.
The authorities report o%n the incident that began, as a man in his thirties was violently picking a fig~h~t i\n a city centre restaurant.
First the man assaulted anothe-r customer inside the restaurant.
This resulted i_n removal from the premises.
Out~side the fighter attacked another man by knoc[k[ing him over.
As a t,h,ird party tried to intervene, the m-an hit also him.
The trip-le assault resulted in calling the police.
A patrol seiz>ed the man, taking him to Kajaani p/oli/ce station, the police say.
The suspected continued to act i;n an aggressive manner in the p+olice station.
H@e kicked the other police in the leg.
He threatened to kill an$d beat up th,e police officers.
The police say the:y to)ok the man in police custody to ‘ calm down ’.
The man is suspected of three assau^lts an!d a violent resisting of an official in th'e performance of his duties.
Humanitarian organisations prepare to begin work a*t Indonesia's Sulawesi - ‘ Clean water is the m{os{t urgent thing ’
United Nations Children ’ s Fun^d UNICEF and other international h.umanitarian organisations are prepared to help at Indonesian island of Sulawesi, recounts Kirsi Haru, Chief of Commun{ication at UNICEF Fi{nland.
The local authorities a[re in charge o~f t!he rescue operations, but the need for extra help is apparent already in this stage.
UNICEF operates in ne(arly every country, and we have long-term projects also in Indones^ia.
UNICEF always has a complete emergency help preparedness, i(n addition to its normal operations, Haru s.ays.
Th$e first t*as*k now is to find the people from the ruins, both the living and the dead.
In the Sulawesi city of P,alu, the rescue operations ar{e ongoi#n, but a bit norther in the area of Donggala, the situation is less clear.
There are still places, where communications do no~t w,ork.
Relief a$ctions are difficult, because al,so the roads are blocked, Haru states.
Buildings on Sulawesi are often lightweight, s.o th'e destruction caused by the earthquake and tsunami are great.
When the survivors have been found, t)hey nee|d shelter - in the beginning f~or example tents - and clean water.
In crisis situ_ation_s, clean water is the most u&rgent thing.
First thing we can generally offer to people are wa~ter purification tablets that also UNICEF has in st\ock.
The goal is to repair the water systems as soon as po~ss~i~ble, bu$t in emergency situa*tions, water is transported with for example trucks.
I'n crisis situations, many children are separated from thei~r parents.
Finding the fam`ily members and reuniting families is one part of the Unicef du&tie&s.
F/ood assistance is organised by, among others, W?FP (World Food Programme), which works as a branch of U/N.
In the first stage, previously raise'd funds are used fo%r emergency help.
Unicef, among others, has however already began t-o raise funds to help the victims of the e'art'h quake and tsunami in Indonesi:a.
Billionaire Elon Musk to quit as Tesla Chairman o@f the Board - 20 million doll<a<r fine for his tweets
Elon Musk, founder of companies manufacturing spa:c:e rockets and electric cars, avoids fraud charges wi!th a deal wit|h the United States ’ Securities and Exchange Commission.
Billionaire Elon Musk qui!ts as electric car company Tesla's C[ha[irman of the Board and agrees to a 20 mill<ion dollar fine.
Musk s\teps down as part of a deal he made with t"he authority regulating th.e United States ’ securities industry.
With this dea*l Musk avoids fraud charges.
The United States ’ Securities and Exchange Commission S,EC threatened musk with a security fraud because of t{he tweets h<e sent in August.
In the.se tweets, Musk wrote h"e is preparing t@o take electric car company Tesla private, which resulted in a quick rise in the company's share price.
According to the deal, M(usk is not allo}wed to act as Tesla chairman of the board for t]hree years.
In addition, Tesla mu_st nominate a new “ independent member ” to its board and tak~e two “ independent managers ” to its management g|ro|up.
Tesla also has t\o found a committee t~o supervise Musk ’ s communications.
Musk is allowed to continue as Tesla C.EO.
O<n top of Musk's personal 20 million dollar fine, Tesla as a company also h/as to pay an equivalent 2$0 million fine to the Commission.
Twee.ts misled investors
According to SEC, Musk's tweets misled in"v"estors and Tesl|a shareholders.
Musk cla"imed to have secured funding to re[purchase Tesla from the stock market to a private company.
According t+o the billionaire's twe*ets, the company would have been bought out from the stock market with a stock price of 420 d=ollars.
After the tweets, Tesla ’ s s;tock price r!ose over ten pe?r cent in twenty-four hours, but later fell.
According to SEC, Tesla's cl;aims had n^o basis of any kind.
According to the Commission, in reality he ha[d not negotiated t+he funding he claimed to have.
Neither had he discussed withdrawing the compa]ny fro(m the market with o_the_r members of the managing group or the company board.
Friday this week, the p!rice decreased 14 p`er cent, as SEC published the fraud charge.
The news about settlement are expected to a+gain re-enforce th<e company's stock price.
The reason is not th|e Last Judgement
Naturally the C$ath$edral's bells won't ring when the hands are no-t moving.
It's a technical ma[lfunction.
The clock i.n Helsinki Cathedral tower has stopped.
T{he hands point at twelve o ’ clock.
The situation is like from a mediocre h&orror film: if only there was incantation coming fr;om the crypt an:d the organ would play by themself.
This is naturally not the case, beca$use the clock ha$s stopp[e[d because of a technical malfunction: it ’ s broken.
A repa&irer has checked it, but there is a part broken a[nd we are waiting to get a new part, sacristan Eveliin^a Jamsen says.
At the same time Jamsen confirms the fact already mentioned by Kirkk`o Helsingi#ssä Twitter account.
That is to say, the reason for the clock stopping is not the Last Ju[dgeme[nt, the a-ccount me]ntion]s.
Jams/en says the church bells don't ring because of a malfunctio"n.
