The president of DFB Grindel sees no basis f[or the returning of Öz"i"l
Berlin - The president of D_FB Reinhard Grindel sees no basis for the returning of Mesut Ö!zil to t%he national team.
There is an open question so you g]et into a co|nve|rsat|ion, you talk to him about why you have apparently f#elt t{hat way, how is stated in his statement, said Grindel in football Podcast `%` Phrasenmäher" of the newspaper "Bild-Zeitung".
In spite of the deba`te going on for months abo"ut th-e photos of Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, he regrets t[h[e return of the 92-match national player Özil.
I would be happ@y if Mesut Özil continued to pla=y for Germany.
At some point of time I also assumed that i~t will happen, said Gr>i>ndel.
The 29-year-old had declared that he quits DFB team in July and explained i!t with t;he fact that Grindel did not protect him against racist hostility during t.he Worl"d Cup.
The DFB head re~peated his criticism of Özil and that he is no#t ready for a discussion with national co-ach and team manager Oliver Bierhoff.
H+e did not want to create any pressure, but h?e knows that in football ‘ i-f you leave a team or change club, you talk to your trainer and I think it is sad that thi~s discussion did n'ot happen before ’.
Linz: Garden sh^ed in allotment gardens burnt down
At 14.1^3 the Linz professional fire department was notified o!f a fire in Angererhofweg.
A}s a high-voltage power line direc|tly traverses the allotment garden, danger was imminent.
The professio%nal fi.re brigade drove out and on arrival found the hut fully in flames.
The roof had to be almost completely removed a&nd the huge amount of debris needed cl@earing.
Th<e owner o'f the b+urning garden hut stated that at noon he had connected a battery to the power supply for charging.
This was the possible cause of t,he fire.
According to t;he fire department the loading un`it was in the most intensive area of the fire.
The damage caused by the f^ire, an;d the cause of the fire, still needs to be investigated.
The dam!age could be considerable as the owner stored many collectibles in h$is garden hut.
Ang.ry mother defends herself: Lindsay Lohan attacks refug\ee family on the street
What provoked Lindsay Lohan t.o such very strange actions?
She apparently wanted to lure the childr{en away from t>he alleged refugee family.
Lindsay Lohan (32, ‘ Herbie: Fully Loaded ’) has live streamed ho?w she openly wanted to tear children a}wa}y from a family i"n Moscow.
This was reported by US portal "TMZ" wi\th publi-ca-tion of a partial recording of the stream.
H'er'e you can see the "Just M`y Luck" with Lindsay Lohan
In the clip y|ou can see how Loh]an gets out of a car and goes up to a possi^bly homeless family, identified as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family flee in front of the actress, Lohan follows the par-ents a(nd their children.
She accuses the adults of child tr,afficking.
Yet s>he does n(ot offer any proof in the clip.
The whole world i}s watching, says Lohan in t|he video as she follows the fa}mily further down the street.
She seems to try to separate the chi]ldren from their paren]ts.
At some point, however, it seems th(at the o!bvi!ously angry mother had it enough.
It looks as if they tu!rn around an^d Lohan gets a slap in the face.
In te^ars, the actress protests abou{t how shocked she is - holding her cheek.
Wha%t provoked Li~n~dsa~y Lohan to such very strange actions is currently completely unclear.

Audi: "Dieselgate" regeneration t(akes longer than planned
There is stil*l a diesel taskforc}e, said Peter Mertens, chief development officer from the ‘ Automobilwoche ’ trade j}ournal.
In December 2017 the imprisoned an~d suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stadler had announced, t?he taskf%or%ce will be dissolved soon.
In the fir#st qua!rter of 2018 all engine/transmission combinations will have been checked, he said at the time.
Mertens now says: ‘ At the start of Ju+ly we have an important milestone by which the diesel crisis wi+ll have been work:e:d out.
We have completed the internal technical analyses of o[ur V[TDI engines.
The taskforce was set up in September 2015 following the discovery a+t Au_di parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens highlighted that the automobile manufacturers had made ‘ serious, organizational changes ’, to prevent su}ch a scandal ever h|appening aga!in.
The VW Supervisory Board had postponed a decision on Stadler's future o%n F^riday an<d will continue this discussion on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities accuse the Audi boss, following awareness of exhaust emission cheating, of permitting the sale o.f diesel au<tomobiles wi>th false emission values.
He must have known abou[t the tampering o.r deliberately ignored it.
Currently the Sales Director Bram Sch>ot heads the company as Acting Chief Executive Offic@er.
After con$v$ersion to the new emissions and consumption standard WL$TP, th\er\e were production losses at Audi, Schot told the ‘ Heilbronner Stimme ’.
Essentially, he se}es a falling demand for limousines such as the Audi models A6, A~7 and A_8, produced in Neckarsulm.
The se=gment in itself is a difficu$lt one, he said.
S%chot is for electromobility.
There are a>lread>y 15,000 reservations for the e-tron, the first Audi electric au%tomobile.
Grindel seeking re-el)ection - Lahm to join t`he Presidential Board of the German football association (DFB)
Mainz (dpa) - Despite the criticism directed at him personally following the early FIFA World Cup exit and t_h_e scandal around Mesut Özil, Re)inhard Grindel wants to run for office as President of th<e DF/B again in the coming yea|r.
I do m.y work and t^ry to make it as good as it gets, said Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning on ZDF ’ s weekly sport\s broadcast "Das aktuelle S,portstudio".
A re-election should be attempted and that i&s what I w#i#ll do.
A!nd th_en you have to see what kind of support you get.
In his own words, th,e head of th`e association would find it `-` strange" if he did not "feel like working on the f/utur/e project" after Germany was awarded the UEFA European Football Championship 2024.
Since April 2016, Grindel has been th"e head of the association as successor to Wolfgang Niersba*ch, who had to resign amidst the scanda~l~s surrounding the 2006 FIFA World Cup in Ger-many.
In autumn 20.16 he was elected for a first full term of three year,s.
The next vote will be held a/t t&he DFB ’ s national conference on September 27, 2019.
According to Grindel, t'he future head organizer of the 2024 European Football Championship in Germany, Philipp Lahm, is t!o j.oin the DFB Presidential Board.
I would be pleased if my c/olleagues on the presidential board a;greed that he will continue to provide advice on the board i-n this role and then of c<ours<e we very much invite him to share his experience in sporting matters, s&aid Grindel.
At the same time, he did not want t=o s^peculat^e as t>o whether or not Lahm could succeed him as head of the DFB.
A;s a consequence of the scandal over the photos taken by Mesut Özil and Ilk(ay Gündogan with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed a preference for a na|tio|nal team player witho|ut an immigration background to fill the position of DFB ambassador for integratio@n.
Cu.rrentl.y, this position is filled by native Brazilian Cacau an|d Celia Sasic, who traces her fam`ily back to Cameroon.
If somebody wi!thout a migration background is an obvious influencer in society and foot?b?all and says, ‘ the issue i]s an impor)tant one, w-e need to do something about it ’, ‘ t!his w`ould also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration needs to work ’, Grindel said.

Erdoğan opens mosque in C~ologne
The Turkish Pre"si"d"ent Recep Tayyip Erdoğan officially opened the Ditib mosque in Cologne on S)aturday.
During his three-day state visit, Erdoğan met with Chancello"r Angela Merkel and Federal Preside|nt Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
Criticism of Germ)any
In his opening speech, Erdoğan c^alled on the German government t=o extradite adherents of the Gülen movement living in Germany an-d to take action against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our citizens wher%ev%er they live.
We will not allow sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement to u>nsettle our citizens and damage the German`/Turkish fr;iendship ’, he said.
Inner city Cologne was partially blocke?d for the opening of the Ditib mos!que.
Many thousands o+f police were deployed, including snipers.
The Ditib Islamic association is under criticism because i"t is s+e+en as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
Global Citizen Festival: M{usic against poverty: Stars, boos and sca:ry moments
Musicians such as Janet Jackson, John Le:ge:nd, Shawn Mendes and Cardi B campaigned for m^ore engagement in th[e fight against poverty and illness at a collective concert in New York ’ s Central Pa"rk.
Ge"t involved wherever yo*u can, s]aid Mendes on Sunday evening at the festival in front of approximately 60,000 spectators.
Thank yo&u for coming, this is a dream.
Cardi B appeared in a r&e&d outfit with tassels and a gold micro,p,hon,e.
I am nervous, I am sweating, but it ’ s OK beca@use I ’ m here an}d ready to change th?e world.
Even actors such a~s Hu!gh Jackm{an and Forest Whitaker, governme_nt representatives, the United Nations and aid organizations appeared on the stage at the spectacle, which lasted for hours.
There was a scary mom+en+t when many spectators mistook the nois|e of a falling metal barrier for shots, got s+cared and tried to run away.
There was a short panic with people running in al&l di_rec_tions.
Seven spectators were sligh"tly injured, said o)rganizer Hugh Evans.
The New York police and music]ian Chris Martin calmed t;he audience from the stage.
Nobody is trying to injure an|yone, said Martin.
You are al=l safe.
A's every y#e#ar, tickets for the "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free of charge online.
I,f you wanted to get one, you had to read and share texts, photos and videos about the global fight against poverty and dis?e?ases onlin*e.
For the numerous musicians and actors there were cheers and applause fr>om the audie%nce - by contrast, Republican Senator J!eff Flake was booed.
Flake did join his Democratic coll\eague Ch;ris Coons on the stage in calling for more equal righ't's between men and women.
On Friday, however, Flake ha|d spoken in the Judiciary Committee of the US Senate supporting th(e nominatio@n of Brett Kavanaugh as a judge on t^he Supreme Court, which offended many women.
At least three women made abuse allegations, including some of att)empted rape ag!ains!t Kavanaugh, who rejects these.
Flake called for an FBI in<vestigation after tw/o women who reportedly experienced sexual assault themselves confronted him on t{he way to a committee meeting in an elevator.
You are welcome to join me in a"n elevator anytime, Flake said to the crowd at the N+ew York conce[rt.
Freedom of Press: Federal government defends exclusion o|f journalist
Government spokesperson Stef)fen Seibert has defended the expulsion of a journalist from the press c,onf,erenc,e of Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish president Rec+ep Tayyip Erdoğan.
In the chancel-le-ry, th+e Turkish journalist living in Hamburg had put on a T-shirt with the Turkish an!d German writing “ Freedom for journalists ” and was sitting in the fi'rst row.
The T-shirt wa-s not the problem, Seibert sa&id to the Bild on Sunday.
It was about a disruption in th{e course of the press conf/erence.
The journalist ’ s action created a lot of un!rest, which w<as unacceptable.
Thus, he ordered bodyguards to escort the m!an ou#t.
Seibert said th&at it was not permitted to demonstrate political concerns at press conferences i{n the federal chancellery.
n.o matter if it i|s a legitimate concern or not.
The rules a!re the rules.
I\n Turkey, many journalists are imprisoned.
Many of them are accused of alleged espionage o[r supporting or being members of prohibited parties or the Fethullah Güle/n mo|v|ement.
The Turkish government holds t(he movement responsible for t"he failed attempted coup on July 15, 2016.
Some of the accused journalists a_re facing se?veral decades in jail.
Eve:n foreign journalists are no[t safe from Turkish authorities: At the beginning of September, the Austrian journalist Max Z?irng?as?t was arrested.
Most recently, the cases of t`he incarcerated jou@rnalists Meşale Tolu and Deniz Yücel caused a stir.
They were rele<ase<d and we\re able to return to Germany, but t%he legal processes in Turkey against the two are still ongoing.
Munich: Florian David Fitz completely drunk with In<a Müller
His fans nor%mally kno"w him to be so fresh and good looking: Florian David Fitz.
You have to look t[w[ice, though: Yes, tha(t's really Florian David Fitz.
The popular actor wa&s i\n Hamburg - and he had a wild night!
Hamburg - The talk show “ Inas Nacht ” [Ina's Night] produ_ce_d by NDR i?s known for its cheery conversations at the ba`r of the Hamburg port pu=b “ Schellfischposten . ”
Moderator Ina Müller of>ten cheers her guests with a beer, some wine or even stronger beverages to loosen up the mood an!d th=eir tongues.
Quite a few celebs also need t"he liquid courage f=or the obligatory vocal number.
Another episode of the popular ta?lk show was recorded on Fri.day.
This time: T<he actor Florian David Fit>z known from films l(ike "Männerherzen", "Terror - Ihr Urteil" or "Der geilste Tag".
The trip did$n ’ t do the actor any go=od, though.
On Saturday, he post,ed a selfie - his face co]mpletely crumpled, only two small slits for eyes.
The b]ed selfie showed a completely drained Florian David Fit#z.
But h]e is not i&ll, he only has quite a hangover.
Addressing h%is fans, he po}sted som\e - probably not entirely serious - insights he learnt: "Rule one: NEVER go to Inas Night.
Rule two: Nev.er d%ri%nk "die schwarze Sau".
And Spri;tz.
And also pass on Ina ’ s round o/f eggnog at half pas|t two."
The long night i@s real$ly showing on the 43-year-olds ’ face.
His fans posted a couple of tips for g'etting rid o|f a hangover.
They ranged fr?om instant broth, fish sandwiches or - p?robably the most effective - painkillers.
Others simply enjo&yed the sight of th<e normally attractive movie star.
We s't'ill don't know how Ina Müller survived the binge drinkin/g at night.
Since she has ho'sted the wild TV fun at t%h%e bar since 2007, the 53-year-old seems to b>e much better prepared ...
Out for a beer with I:na Müller.
Treysa h%as struggled against vandalism and garbage
Accessing the 36-kilometer cycle track in Ro<tkäpp<chen<land in Treysa is very difficu;lt and heavily littered.
Attempts are made to re~medy the rampant vandalism, b-ut there are hardly any signs of solutions.
S#ha#rds, cigarette bu$tts, garbage and rubbish, demolished ru]bbish bins and now dismantled signs - so for quite some time presents itself the entrance with se|ating area to the bike path on the Haaße-hill in Treysa.
The sight of the bicycle p_ath, which i}s the flagship object in Rotkäpchenland, is more than inglorious.
The matter is of concern to the ADFC (German Cyclists Association) chapter Schwalmstadt, but others have also taken interest for some t(i(me, according to the ci;ty '\s cycling comm%issioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has already been addressed b*y the bicycle traffic adviso(ry body.
There i}s no solution so far.
Suggestions ran{ged fro{m transferring the seating area to the regular emptying of garbage cans, and cleaning the point of en!try areas.
I think, the latte"r woul/d be the order of the day, irrespective of any furt/he/r activities, says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Ha.h.n (ADFC) says he also brought the issue u=p with the local advisory council.
Not o"nly th:e rubbish is a nuisance for cyclists and residents - on w'eeke'nds the seating group is a regular meeting place for partying.
I.t is no[t just about the noise, there are also disturbances du!e to parties: Posts pulled out of the ground, garbage cans wrecked, signs snapped and s,eati,ng daubed.
Frequently volunteers have already cleaned up, explain-s the ADF{C member Susanne Klippert.
Actions are only proverbial drops in the o=cean.
They are annoyed that th!e rest area at the cycle track in Treysa is a meeting point for b`in`g`e-`dri`nking.
Clearly the focus point along the entire b'ike path is here on the Haaße, confirms the cycling commissioner, w}ho n+ow is also responsible for the c;ycling site in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
If it suffers the same fate, it will cos!t dea^r^l^y.
Another idea is placing video surveillance on the hill: `\` Possibl,y this raises the threshold to engage in damaging common prop+erty.
Ho<wever, this would require a police patrol to c*om*e out.
In principle, Wüstenhagen sup}port}s the development of the Haaß~e hill.
It needs to be made mo=re attractive.
So far one can be very satisfied with how we%l%l the bicycle p^ath is frequented.
It i<s still possible to develop tourism-related marketing.
Our cycle track is of very high quality compared to ot=hers in German ’, agreed th*e ADFC members.
A[DFC member Susanne Klippert considers the situation in the Ascheröder St,rasse in Treysa to be critically dangerous.
Th~ere is no turning lane on Haaße Hügel.
In heavy traffic, cyclists may en_d u`p waiting in the m^iddle of bidirectional traffic flows", she explains.
That would not be a proble!m for sporty cyclists, but is for o+lder people and especially for children.
Music contest at the cu~lture train station: T.he "Kö von Hiltrup" and the sea
Th-e first call to participate in the music contest was a success, creative and cooperativ,e.
Your Song for Hiltrup is the motto of th(e Hiltrup initiative fo/r the "Music Contest for young and old, new and experienced musicians . '&'
A contest "with a w]ink from the l\ovel\y Hiltrup family", as Karl Franke worded it.
In fact, it soon became a famili;al togetherness with coffee and cake from the volunteers o{f the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven acts performed, from a one-man band to the big ensemble: Alvi>n Jasic with pianist Marce\l Untied, Henk Humberg with his gui\ta\r, Rolf Ihmig, a`n old-established Hiltrup m)an, t)he "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members from three generations of the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from the kindergarten Lummerland and finally Rike Weßling u^nd die Zwarties.
This c`on`test is a novelty, explains district mayor Jo-achim Schmidt.
We have no{t seen so)me)thing like this in other districts.
What did th(e songwriters sing about?
Particularly popular places we[re the Hiltrup lake and Marktallee.
Rolf Ihmig dedicated the song to the avenue Marktalle i[n his folk-like song "Kö von Hiltr*up".
The Kulturbahnhof wa&s also mentioned.
Over and over again, the acts sa|ng about exp&e&ri&encing togetherness in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke led the audience t|hro|ugh the breaks with short interviews with the performers or some inform@ation ab%ou%t the artists.
Thus, the audience learnt that Humberg that h$e h#a#d actually studied chemistry, but now also teaches guitar.
F*rom the sound engineer Stefan Sc#hemm#elmann Franke reported that he had recently performed in Lud^wigshafen - at a major BASF event with Barclay James Harvest as a main act.
An@d Alvin Jasic has uploaded a l{ot of YouTube videos.
I%t ’ s not about wi>n>nin>g, Franke had said.
In fact, al$l participants received a gift fr#om Hiltrup catering businesses.
For the j&ury's favorites there was something special - so that o#the#rs could also hear their songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied ca#n reco.rd an entire CD with sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other mu%sicians can record a song: Ihm#ig with his Hiltrup hi$t, which espec+ial+l+y impressed Franke with his musicality, and the “ Lummerland pack: ” “ a very good performance ” with ten c.hildren and two teachers on guita>r and cajón, Laura Kastner and Lina Tölle.
Like everyone else, t-h-e children also performed again fo%r the finals - and even without electroni;c support, they sounded "really good," Franke said.
The ju{ry was guided b~y the aspects of originality, reference to Hiltrup, catc^hiness of the melody and recognition value.
The jury included Gisbert Keller f)r)om the Westphalian School of M"usic, Andreas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers from the Trade Associa&tion as well as Jan Kaven, ch%a%i%rman of the district offensive.
The district offens;i;ve launched the event on the o=ccasion of its ten-year anniversary.
They considered the event a complete succe;s;s.
Everyone was `'` very satisfied," and `,` the atmosphere was good" in the very crowded Kulturbahnhof.
The Word Game: Testing `~` Decrypto"
The players form t_wo team\s and sit opposite one another.
For each page there is a screen, on it there are four cards w"ith keywo~rds that y"o"u can decipher - the old trick with the red foil.
This e}nsures the other side cannot read anyt:hing unintentionally.
For exa+m+ple, on the cards it says t=o read from left to right: "1 . Renaissance.
2 . Fe&nster.
3 . Cub'e.
4 . So=lidʺ.
These are the te(rms that need to be coded.
So the terms ar{e not guessed, the codes ar~e.
Takin+g turns, one player per team i"s the encryptor.
They get a code ca+r+d that has `/` 3.4.2 ." etc . written on it.
In `{` Decrypto," it is not the words behind the secret fil[m that should b=e guessed, but their encryption codes.
The task in this case: They should - in this order and in this example - describe the terms `<` cube", "solid" an~d "window" - i=n such a way that his own team recognizes the correct order and the opposing tea"m does not, because t#he team th&at cracks t.he code twice wins the game.
The encryptor writes dow~n and reads aloud: "Throw" for the dice, `]` loose" as opposed t_o "solid". Of course, something lik<e "evidence" would be possible or "Prague" because he read s/ome histo@ry books and knows about the defenestration of Prague.
T%h%is then progresses, round for round, team b<y team.
It is true that on(e does not know the terms of the oth<er side - but with every clue the encryptor gives, you ’ re clos<e<r to finding them ou?t.
S/o the term should be as mysterious as possible, bu)t not too crazy . Otherwise, you make it unnecessarily di+ffi+cult for your team.
The mos&t cryptic ‘ Decrypto ’ is the precep^t unfortunately.
The players have to study it for quite a lon:g time and in detail, u,nt,il they ca_n finally play it.
The explanatory video un~der de(crypto.info on the web will make it easier.
But o&nce you have started, you ’ l&l be amazed a"t how much emotion there is in this nondescript game.
Overall, ho`wever, "Decrypto" is not quite a:s conclusive as its predecessor and genre-primus "C"odenames", which also makes use of the spy theme for a gam)e with few words, but it ’ s much easi>er to play in small groups.
And if it's all about guessing and not about winning, it's e]asy t"o pl|ay a version for two.
Kulmbach: M<an give,s police the Hitler salute and harasses guests in the pub
During th`e night from Saturday to Sunday a 48 year old man gave the police station in Kulmbach twice so#meth#in#g to d`o.
First he showed the Hitler salute to a passing polic]e patrol in t_he uppe|r town, later he was also found in the upper town in a pub where he ha&rassed other guests.
After cl}early under the influence of alcohol he did not comply wit~h the police order to vacate the premises, he ha]d to spend the night in the de%tentio%n cell in the police station of Kulmbach.
In the sober state, he also had to take l+egal responsibility for the use of symb_ols of un'constitutional organisations.

The crashing from bumper to bumper co"uld be heard throughout Pressig, remembers Georg Dinke=l, who archives the history of the place an+d the stations.
This did n*ot bother anybody.
The squeaking of br&akes and ratt'li'ng of carriages could also be heard.
This was pu{re railway.
Statements that ar;e symbolic fo$r Dinkel ’ s Pressig homeland.
Nowhere in the Franconian forest has a plac#e been characterized by t=he railway so much.
This was the starting point f=or the steep mountain section to the north, wh^ich peaks in Steinbach am Wald following an ascension of a#bout 220 meters.
Previously trains a)nd locomotives housed in Pres&sig were needed to handle this.
In 1901 th`e Bavarian pa,rl,iament approved the building of a depot with 21 locomotives, apprentice w,orkshops, catenary and railroad maintenance division.
The centerpiece w[as t)he turntable, which a,fter reconstruction in the year 1899 had a diameter of 18 metres, says Norbert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway historian and a professional railroader with 47 ye-ars of experience.
T>h>e Pressig depot, w?hich in the y%ear 1968 was relocated to Bamberg, also operated locomotives for the branch lines Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg and Kronac/h - Nordhalben.
On July 15 1950 th>e "Volksblatt" reported of a staff of 160 men; 13 steam locomotives and eight electric locomotives we>re stationed in Pre}ss}ig at t^hat time.
The electrification of the track in 1939 r(educed the need for pulling trains an|d locomotives.
Fr^om 1977 they were still used with freight trains.
By 19{9{1 at least 10,000 wagons were shunted.
In 1982 the depot was part$ially dismantled and the rema.inder in the year 1991.
Heidrich: ‘ It ’ s a shame that better use o=f the location is not envisag~ed, also with regard to fr}eight traffic ’.
Still in the year 1989 at Pentecost, the Nurember>g Railway Dir)ectorate celebrated "50 years of electrification Nurember>g - Saalfeld" w[ith a pompous station festival for the anniversary in Pressig.
10,000 enthusiastic spectators were here, remembers Georg D_i_nkel.
S"hortly afterwards.
On J>une 1, 1991 the last 3]0 men were withdrawn and the Pressig marshalling yard was history.
The shunters and wheel scotches took c#are of the heaviest rail traffic work, r=emembers Dinkel.
Each mistake c&ould have fatal consequences.
Why the Pressig-Rothenkirchen sta!tion led to a change in t%he hierarchy of both locations and how many more historical and c|urr|ent pictures there are, is included here in th!e infrankenPlus article.
Kerbe`r with initial success at China Open
Beij?in?g (dpa) - Wimbledon winner Angelique Kerber and Laura Siegemund have r}eached the second ro"und in the tennis tournament in Beijing, just as Julia Görges before.
Kerber won 6?:2 at the Chin|a Open against Frenchwoman Kristina Mladenovic.

On the weekend as part of the `~` Art and Enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was opened i*n Mittele~hrenbach.
Organisers and visitors showed great relief that the weather conditions were ideal fo.r the special vernissage of the "Winds>piel->Per>formance" which took place in th!e open air on the Dahlmann-Schmidt p!roperty in Mittelehrenbach.
It takes pl?a?ce und*er the umbrella of the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" (Around Walberla) i=n the fr>amework of the series "Art and Enjoyment".
Th?is opened its doors for the 15th year.
The large number of visitors s}howed the fascina;tion with the exhibits.
21 exhibits from 20 artists c@an now be viewed in Mittelehre)nbac)h.
The host Jü>rgen Dahlmann welcomed the artists at the opening of t=he exhibition.
He h#ad been there from the first hour.
A\s has Volker Hahn, wh(o has made a nam|e for himself as the main organiser as well as an artist.
It w*as a little surprising when Hahn announced his retirement so@me days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kur}t Neubauer he put his task in experienced, young han]d]s with excellent future prospects.
In t!h!e past, both have already been actively involved i<n the selection of artists and have helped in designing flye>rs.
Once again this year there w_i_ll be a 70 cent special stamp designed on th?e occasion of Ku*nst & Genuss (art a{nd enjoyment), available at every art station.
T;h;e poster this year ‘ out{d{an{ce the Betzn ’, designed by Volker Hahn, can be purchased for eight eur[os.
Hahn enjoyed t'he excellent reception of the special exhibit.
It was possible to persuade Ma_x Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg to provide music@al framing.
Th!e visitor quickly understands when walking through the spacious garden that t<he title "Windspiel-Performance" literally challenges the artistic imagination and ultimately expresses it i_n a playful way.
There are metal or ceramic works o;f art, often accented with colo^r.
Already a>t the entrance to the property, on the right side, the visitor is awaited by th$e "Gl=ücksbaum" (luck tree) by the artist Werner Baur, Es,chenau.
It is a tree stump, brightened with color, equipped with 2"0 pin wheels, 24 hor"seshoes and 24 a;lu;min;um tubes for a sound piece.
The sun shining through the bush+e+s in the background adds a magical to{uch to the object, inviting visitors t+o linger.
Barbara Waschneck comes from Eckental and prefers to d-edicate three-dimensional letter`s to the event 15 years K & G.
There are many parts mov+ing in the wind.
Halfway through the path Siegrid Frey from Eckental exhi+bited her wor"k "Der Wind das himmlische Kind" (The Wind the Heaven$l$y Child).
At the e~nd, Volker Hahn de@mons@trates his colorful fantasy created from clay, cement and stainless steel.
The ‘ wind chime performance ’ theme wan?ders through the multi-purpose art exhibiti,on.
The special exhibition can be viewed un:til December 3\1, 2018.
5~0 years of MGV 68 Albachten: S:inger:s celebrate 50th birthday
1968 - That was the time of th/e pr_o_test and the student movement.
A`nd also the people of Albachten demonstrated their anger.
A>t least five of them.
In no cas:e did they want to accept t/h/at after the dissolu&tion of the church choir "Cäcilia" there would be no more singing life in the district.
It h]as become a legend by now: A't a bank in Tinnenbusch, the MGV 68 came t|o existence.
That was 5\0 years ago.
Now there will be a big anniversary celebration in th_e “ House o;f Encounter . ”
It will b;e ful#l today, senses chairman Jürgen Holstiege, and he was right.
There are 150 guests, a rea&l success f+or the Albachten singer.
They had revived the founda*tion festival especially fo+r the anniversary.
It was a tradit?ion for years, an]d then there was a break for the first time.
The traditional festival was bac<k again in time for th`e 50th anniversary.
It became an elegant ball and fo'rmal clothing had be:en requested beforehand.
Guests did not sit in rows as usual in the “ House o`f Encounter, ” b.ut rather sat comfortab[ly around tables.
I*n between, everyone could d!ance . DJ Matthias Drees from Nottuln pu~t on the controls and heated up the dance floor.
Of course, the singers o#f the MGV 68 Albachten would l{et their voices sound.
Matching the occasion, happy songs w]ere quite fitting.
Almost set: "So ein Ta~g, so wund-erschön wie heute."
There w>as also the “ Rüde[sheim wine ” to go with the ex[quisite grape juice, which many guests had in front of them.
“ Humulus lu`pulu`s, ” which is the Latin name for ‘ hop(s, ’ references another cool drink.
The choir direction of Richard Homann, wh{o is one o$f the five who were in Tinnenbusch back then, was onc:e again very confident.
It's just f:un to sing under his direction, said Holstiege . "He has such a`n ea=sy way, h`e accomplishes a masterpiece every time.". By the way, this time not only me:n were presented vocally.
The ladies ’ choir “ High C ” were also guests, whose repertoire above all includes eve'rgreens fr^om the 20s to th~e 60s.
To round it all off there wa.s some poetry.
Singer Theo Weber sat at his desk until three in the morning to create hi`s ow)n rhymes.
And Andreas W(interhof(f also presented melodic poetry.
There was also a big To+mbola game.
The proceeds are t.o go towards financing the children of t{he Albatros Youth Center visiting the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: Women '?s 3rd League: USC I.I wins high-class derby against BW Aasee
The promoted team marches o@n.
Three game;s, thr}ee wins - USC Münster's reserves, under th[e patronage of Axel Büring, gets on really well in league three.
No trace of shyness or getting the heebie-jeebies . The independents are doin)g their thin}g.
And with the 3-,0 (25-15, 25-23, 26-24) against city rivals B-W Aase-e, they did really well.
It w@asn't crystal clear, but we have already left an impression, say\s the reasonably satisfied coach.
BWA coach Ka;i Annacker immediately agreed with hi\m: “ This is a defeat that we can live with.
We a%re not dissatisfied. ” Quite the contrary.
In the eve%ning, at Ronja de Bo(er ’ s belated birthday party, the moo$d was good, the game was done.
Yes, the result is in fact a`n optical ill(usion.
In the third s/et, the guests had a set ba.ll.
If you b}ring it to the finish, such a game can also tip over quite easily, Büring knows fr*om years o"f experience.
Ultimately USC ma\de everything clear with its experienced players and finished it ou!t.
We all k*now who is on the other side in such a der}b}y.
Th*at was not our undoing.
I've seen a gr,ea,t game of volleyball at times, Annacker did not struggl{e with the 0-3 and went straight back to the age,n,da.
After just three matchdays, it d%oes not seem foreseeable where the independents ’ journey go~es.
I]t ’ s si!mply too early for that, says Axel Büring.
He only feels vindicated i.n one thing: “ The 3rd Women's Le~ague has an unbelievabl@y good level of play.
It ’ s not even close wit$h regional league vo:lleyb:all. ” They d>on't even want to look down towards the fourth league.
I[f they don ’ t want to lose hope, they have to lo@ok up.
But a co;nclusi;on c.an't be drawn until after ten or eleven games.
The next game is a]t Emlichheim on Saturday.
Aasee wi{ll compete in Essen on October 14.

The pilot of a g[lide[r tha%t crashed in Essen died.
On Sunday afternoon, the single-seated aircraft crashed during landing in a parkin)g lot near the airport Essen-Mülheim, said a pol|ice spokesman o[n Sunday in Essen.
Th,e parking lot next to the 52 highway that is norm@all@y used for shuttle transport to the conference, was relatively e.mpty, other people were not inju`red in the crash.
Emergency counselors took care of other student pilots and eyewitnesses o=n s%ite.
I^n the immediate vicinity there was the venue of an Oktoberfest, in the eveni~ng many guests were expected t#o be there.
The cause of the crash was not clear - t"he weather was g~ood, ther&e was a slight wind and sunshine.
Essen/Mülheim is a small airport, which is frequently used by pilots with light privat@e plan]e]s.
About her marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide K*eller did not feel she was enou"gh for her husband
Th)e "Dream Ship '"' made Heide Keller a star.
Now she speaks openly that the series co~uld have h=ad some influence on her divorce with Hans von Borsody.
Hei)de Kel@ler (76) became famous in her role a.s chief hostess Beatrice von Ledebur on the ‘ Dream Boat ’, but o\n 01 January 2018 she disembarked forever.
The series that made her a star might be on<e of the reasons of her f.ailed marriage to Hans von Borsody (1929 - 2013), to whom she had be<en married f"or ten years.
This could also have b{een a reason.
Because this work became a part o$f me, I traveled around t>he world wi_th a suitcase a[lone and many of my admired colleagues treated me as equal, explained Keller in the interview to "Bild am Sonntag '{'.
She used to be `)` the wife o)f Hans von Borsody", but that had changed with the `^` Dream Ship".
Because now j<ournalists called her only as Heide Keller.
I don ’ t know if he w%as happy with th#is.
She thinks that it possible that her husb-and might have been je'alous at the time, b+ut "as many men H+ans was afraid of talking about problems and feelings."
Keller always ma-de effort fo:r Hans von Borsody `$` and he did not want to discover my fears and my weaknesses.
In plai!n language it mean(s: I ’ m pretending," as she explains further.
She always had the feeling o.f ‘ no`t being enough for him.
He saw in me an emancipated woman, which actually I never was, even t/ho/ugh I sometimes app`eared cheeky a!nd courageous on stage.
I wanted our love t]o last forever ’.
Afte}r a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härt]ner, Keller sa;id ‘ Yes ’ again, ‘ although I was scared it could go wrong again ’.
The day before the civil marriage, I sat in the changing room crying and wanted t.o c%ancel everything.
The marriage to von Borsody failed as wel}l.
Why d'id it never work out with men?
Because I wanted too m'uch.
Keller w=as in love at that time "a[s in the movie.
Unfortunately, this vision i"s not compatible with daily l$ife.
I am too na~i~ve to approach love."
The moth, who regula<rly explores the city nightlife in the NZZ Zurich area, h~as now attempted this on the ZFF o=pening party.
Not real'ly a moth, just a little shady.
And the shiny glare, in which a green carpet is bathed in, on t*he S+echseläu+tenplatz, blinds him over th/e charge.
It is the film festival though, w"here the more or less famous want t+o bathe in the spotlight.
S|o this late Thur-sday evening he tottered across the square, to briefly relieve hi#m#se#lf in the "Aquaclean toilet oasis".
This is the name of the public toilet complex sponsored by a large sa?nit?ary company, which is being premiered at the festival: Th@e publ/ic convenience on the ground floor of a new pavilion tries hard t\o create a luxuriou]s ambience.
This evening, w#hatev#er the reason, it literally stinks in the gen!ts area.
So out of here, over to th,e other side of the stre=et: Invited guests, who were entertained at the best level at the cinema next door with the opening film `/` G{reen Book", like every year celeb:rate the openi$ng of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its na,me fits perfectly with this film festival: It is we*ll known that the works shown origina`te from the whole globe.
Wha]t do you have to come up with when writing an article about this festival, so as not to fall in\to hidden advertising for its 190 pa_rtner companies.
The moth binds a ribbon around the feelers that a fairy godmother has sent him, and two beefy doormen ge:ner:ously let hi=m p/ass inside.
Inside, the invi*ted are crowded together, they d{ance way past midnight t`o liv>e music or accept rhythms dictated by the DJ, t+o which they shout at each other, and rinse exquisite appetizers down with a glass of champagne.
I]n the delicatessen in the basement oysters await slurping mouths, nearby the unparalleled Culatello di Zibello ra+w ham is fres!hly cut, and a chocolate fountain bubbles.
And the highlight is: that the shop sh+elves have not been cleared of the exclu?sive products for t^he event.
It has been like t:hi:s for years and seems t:o function without any major losses.
You must just love the co;untry for it!
Th@e moth studies the sign by the escalator: "Please be careful on the es"calator if yo:u are wearing a long dress".
Should thi#s be two separate instructions, h]e has ignored the dress code.
However, it is a con?dition?al construction that has undoubtedly saved liv+e+s.
In the household goods department o(n the upper floor, the win-ged man tips dow~n a cocktail made with espresso called "Golden Eye", which is suited to the festival awa?rd.
The mixtu)re getting the prize for the best drink, presented by a capsule m;anufacturer - not compulsory.
And George Clooney, who ha;s been advertising for the bran|d mentioned for ye"ars, is also not there on the evening.
There is one face, h@ow@ever, b?etw?een local notables, cash desk and kitchenware, that i^s familiar to the spectators: Peter Farrelly, Dir,ector of the opening film.
Its main charac'ter will not be far away.
And i$n reality: Immediately, Viggo Mortensen, who is almost sixty walks through the cr=owd appearing al<mo<st like a choir boy.
He is not talked into, n;ot gaped at, at the most he r*eceives stealthy glances.
This restraint, easily mistaken for inhibition, is why th=e international star!s love this film festival.
M+aradona celebrates victory in Mexico with a Cumbia dance
Trainer and ex-footballer, Diego Maradona is del-ighted at his team ’ s victor'y.
Argentina ’ s football legend, Diego Maradona has clearly settled well i+n his n<ew homeland Mexico.
The 57-year-old coach danced with a player in the changing room to Cumbia rhythms after a 2:0 vi|cto|ry for his club Dorados d)e Si(naloa, as sho!wn in a video already released on Saturday.
A team me;mber ’ s 15-second clip s-hows Maradona danci&ng in a yellow strip, cheered on by the players.
The Mexican second league team defeated Leone"s Negros 2:0.

Han<dball: Association League 1: ASV S_ende_n "devastated" after last-minute loss
Swen Bieletzki, coach of t:he handball club ASV Senden, c}ould hardly believe it: "Such a bitter defe@at. ” His protégés were “ devastated ” after the unfortunate 29:30 (12:14) failure - the fourth in four games - Saturday ev]ening a=t LIT Germania 2.
Ove_r lo&ng periods, they had - as in Steinhagen, as against Hüllhorst - not played badly.
We only o%verslept the initial phase, said the A'S'V coach annoyed.
Quick:ly, the home team led with 8-1, also the e'arly b^reak, that Bieletzki had taken, did not pan out.
Bu@t then suddenly a jolt went through the team, summarized Bieletz?ki.
At halftime, they were only t*wo goals behind.
Senden's best p_lay_er, Mar)ius Hintze, kept scoring in phase one.
Af_ter th:e change, things got even better from the visitors ’ point of view.
After 33 minutes, David Ernst equalized fo:r 15-15.
Four minutes before th%e alarm, the lead was still only thre>e goals (29-26).
And th)en?
Th:e impartial got in on the action.
Bieletzki usually does not see\k blame with others.
But: The 120-second time penalty caused b^y Steffen Mühlhoff “ wa?s a joke . ”
LIT had an opportunity an$d scored four more times until the end - whil,e the deci;mated ASV also failed in the last attack.
The bo`ys fought great, defended well an@d repeatedly threw the ball on the empty goal.
But com_plimen_ts don ’ t win games.
Now it must be a dam\ned vict`ory, said Bieletzki.
ASV goals: Hintz&e (9), Erns|t (6), Schlög<l (4), Kr{e{ts{chmer (3), Kümper (2), Mühlhoff (2), van de Pol (2).
Hügi?ng (1).
Bavaria: Woman missing for 30 years - Police di{g for body pa:rts
Mo@re than 30 years af;ter the disapp)earanc)e of a (then) 18 year old Naila (district of Hof), polic*e are searching for the remains of the woman.
Response services du^g up a street o)n Saturday near Marxgrün.
For t.his purpose, the road surface and several layers were removed below, as police a^nd prosecutors announced.
According to new findings, the missing woman may have been b|uried not far fro,m her former home.
The woman dis^appeared on November 4, 1986.
Inve)stigato)rs at the time di`d not rule out foul play.
According to information, since last year the criminal investigatio:n department of Hof has b+een working inte&n&sive&ly on the case together with the public prosecution department.
Together wi;t;h scientists from the Technical University o.f Munich and the Bavarian Monument Protec-tio-n Authority, the investigators discovered a conspicuous feature under the road in Marxgrün by mea#ns of a ground radar.
With the help of a dog trained o,n th~e smell of human bones, the officials were able to limit th=e area to a few yaars.
Th{e res_ults of the excavations are to be announced this afternoon.

Elon Musk, founder of the elec)tric car manufacturer Tesla, has escaped his threatened di;smissal as the chief executive o<f the billion dollar company.
He and the US Securities and Exchange Comm<ission (SEC) settled a lawsuit out of court regarding misleading Tweets i@n which Mu=sk could have lost his ability to manage listed compa\nies.
As part of the settlement, Musk and T]esla are each paying 20 million US dollar$s . In addition, Musk is giving t^he office o-f chairman up for three years.
He may stay CE@O, though.
In the set[tlement, which still has to be confirmed by a court, Musk nor Tesla admitted wrongdoi"ng.
The SEC ha~s s'ued the world-famous manager in the US federal court of Manhattan for fraud.
Musk, who also heads Spa(ceX, is the public face of the el]ectric car pioneer currently posting losses, which is now val\ued at more than $50 billi|on on the stock market.
Musk unaware of an'y wrongdoing
Musk explained that he did not~hi~n~g wrong and is very sad an{d disappointed about the lawsuit.
He has always acted in t.h.e spirit of truth and transparency and with his inve^stors in mind.
On August 7, Musk wrote t<o his m}ore than 22 million Twitter followers that he would maybe remove the company fr"om the stock exchange and pay 420 US dollars per share . The financing wa,s secured.
That would h?ave valued Tesla at 72 billion dollars.
Musk lat<er backpedaled: Tesla remains a listed company.
According to the agreement, Tes$la now has to find external chairman, appoint two independent board me:mbe:rs and also set u+p a committee to monitor Musk's communication.

The te;am of the controversial coach J>osé Mourinho earned a justified lost at West Ham United 1:3 (0:2) and remains with te'n points after seven matchd@ays only in the middle of the table.
T}he pressure on Mourinho will continue t}o grow ahead of the Champions League match against Valencia on Tuesday.
The former Leverkusen goalkeeper Bernd Leno made hi~s first Premier League appearance a>fter Petr Cech was injured.

The bandwidth is also great for th?e other parties: The AfD, in many polls h*olds t*he position of sec"o"nd strongest party, comes to 15 to 18 percent.
The Greens receive v(ote quotas of 12.5 to 1^7 percent.
The Left have an average o.f 10 percent, the F=DP 9 percent.
Such survey@s have an uncertainty of p;lus/min;us 2 to 3 percent, according to s;tat;istical reasons, depending on the share of votes.
Si%nce the 2017 general election however the backing for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CD%U) has also fallen signi/ficantly in the population.
Currently o;nly 48 percent of citizens believe Merkel is the ri`ght person i]n the Chancellery, as is revealed in the Emnid survey commissioned by BamS.
Only one in two (50 percent) in the survey want a grand coalition by the nex.t regular parliamentary e`lect`ion in thr>ee years, 41 percent wan[t a re-election.
Even in another survey published o$n Saturday clear l>osses in approval for Merkel were noted.
Divided was also the assessment of Germans concerning whether in December Merkel should again run fo`r the CDU presi>dency.
According t,o Emnid, 47 percent are in f*a*vor, 44 percent against.
In the case of the unioni@sts, 64 percent want a candidacy, 35 percent do n?ot.
Poster at A`ld`i: Love at a discount
Wi\ll Aldi become Tinder 2.0?
Whoever says th?a?t there are no romant`ic "How we met" -stories anymore in times of Tinder, sh:oul:d head over to Aldi and talk about turkey meat.
Munich - In times o,f digital "fast-food dating" by Tinder and ot|h|er dating apps, the supermarket exudes an almost anachronistic romance a?s a place to me~et ‘ the one ’.
Yeah, right . If in doubt, talking about discoun*ted turkey me]at, boxer shorts at the rummage table, or your favorite pudding is still a better story for y]our future grandchildren than a mere right swi/p/e.
The ap"p Tinder has the reputation o?f b\eing less of a place to meet, but rather more of lewd exchange.
We made the test: How do w?omen react, if you do not beat around the bush in the fi@rst me;s;sage?
Here is the am;azin;g result.
There ’ s true Hollywood Lovestory potential w&ith a lost-and-foun=d plot.
If the guy then messages his inamorata with the e'-mail ad^dress organic-turkeymeat @ gmail.com, then that sounds very mu}c}h like Meg Rya/n, Hugh Grant and the like - Romantic Comedy at its best.
S.o, we wi#sh the creator of t]his ad in a\n unknown Aldi branch that she will also find the man o<f her dreams, with whom she had talked briefly about the "Organic turkey meat, 30 percent off".
We should all believe i+n the magic of analogue acquaintance . T&his woman definitely earned her Hollywood happy ending.
B)il)lerbe)ck: 500 caps for a life without polio
Since the start of t;he new school year the Ludgerischule h}as been involved in the action ‘ Caps against Polio - 500 c`aps for a life without polio ’.
Polio is the abbre~vi~a~tion for poliomyelitis, an infectious disease caused by the pol|iovirus.
The disease referred to in Germa{n as child p@aralysis (Kinderlähmung) causes paralysis and even death.
In Germany, polio is considere>d eradicated, but there are still three countries worldwide where the diseas;e occurs.
A press relea?se stated that to date the cause of po~liomyeliti~s, the poliovirus, can onl(y be contained by vaccination.
Soccer: Reus and Zorc demand rest f,or Götze
Leverkusen (AP) - BVB sporting d,irector Michael Zorc and captain Marco Reus have ca=lled for an en)d to the public debate on Mario Götze ’ s sh$ape and fitness.
We s"hould stop worrying about Mario.
That does n\ot do him any good.
And it also does n.ot do us any good, said Reuss, Götze ’ s friend, after the 4-2 victory i?n Leverkusen in an interview with the T$V channel S/ky.
Zorc h-ad already emphasized this before the game.
This is n|ot an easy situation for him personally.
F.oo.t.ball: Eberl: No rush for contract ta?lks with Hecking
Mönche{n{gladbach (dpa) - Manager Max Eberl from Bundesliga soccer team Borussia Mönchengladbach does not se~e any rush for a possible contract extension with tra|iner Dieter Hecking.
W:e have not even talked about a contract up t)o now.
There is no fixed date when w[e w'ill do so.
There will certainly come a moment, wh$en we sit down and talk, said Ebe$rl o#n Sunday evening on the Sky TV channel.
Football: Distr/i/ct League: Strong appearance of Vf;L Wolbeck against the SC Altenrheine gives hope
There were moments in this young season, when Al>ois Fetsch was really hard on hi/s team.
Silently, the coach of the football district league club Vf|L Wolb`eck first retreated (inwardly) to ponder over the lack of mot]ivat]ion on the playing field.
All i}s history.
Meanwhile, the game is o'n at Brandhoveweg.
The 1:1 on Sunda~y against SC Altenrheine prove'd so, and they almost got promoted past season.
Yes, I a}m very happy with the appearance.
We made tighte*ned spaces and put p`ressure on the ball.
That was something t/o be proud of, praised Fetsch his boys and went to each of his p;la;yers in@dividually after the game to s;imply say "thank you" for the great defense against the ambitious guests.
The coach ha=d to change the sy"stem after 26 minutes.
Following Nico Frerich's injury (muscular prob\lems) - for him came Luca Rehberg - the 4-4-2 al{m{o{s{t seamlessly ch(anged into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was in the front line w%a%iting for passes to him.
Wolbeck had much more t;ime of possession i_n the first half.
And more op.po.rtunitie.s
But Frerichs (17), substit{ute Luca Rehbe\rg (26m) and Jan Schroer (38th) miss#ed the lead.
It almost b:ackfi:red when SCA ’ s very own Kevin Vollrath and Chris Naberbäumer made tw_o dangerous attacks ag|ainst Wolbecker in minute 41, but goalie Damian Hallas pro@v@ed to be a master of his trade.
After halftime, VfL boldly took com`p`lete control.
Thewes just barely faile|d with a shot f>rom 18 meters.
Schroer was too late i/n minut]e 58 when Thewes passed him the ball.
Fetsch decided t~o freshen up the team on the left wing and p\ut in Miles Geske.
As Alten]rh]ei]ne's Chris Naberbäumer cut down Robin Westhues in minute 70, the home team got an indirect free kick 18 me|ters away from the go>al.
Th'e fouled player himself stepped up and demonstrated how dangerous he can be i[n set play situations.
Westhues kicked the bal=l with his strong right and the goalie had t?o face t!h!e fact that he had failed: 1:0 (minute 71).
With 20 minutes l{eft on the clock, the ga.me seemed to last forever.
Because then this happened: In minute 80, VfL captain Flor\ia\n Qua[beck accidentally touched th/e ball in the box.
Referee Hüseyin Sahin (Hamm) immediately pointed t$o the p'oi'nt.
Jannis S~chneider w.as not ready to miss this opportunity (minute 79).
Wolbeck had to endure long m`inu`tes i<n the final stage, when Geske finally managed to finally get that ball into the goal and sec/ure th)e winning goal in minute 87.
That might have been ove[rki[ll.
VfL: Hallas - N. Rehberg, Quabeck, Bo_din, J. Schroer - Klemke (75th m$inute Seid&el), Be]nsmann - Freri|chs (26th minute L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vielmeyer (66th minute Geske) - Thewes

Eintracht Fran,kfurt beats Hannover 96 4:1
Background: Four points af+ter five ma@t@ch days - coach Adi Hütter was not going to b#e happy with that.
Eintracht Frankfurt wanted to ta&ke the first home victor#y at last against Hannover 96.

Helicopter crashed i[n Kottingbrunn
During t)he landing, the a)ccident happened at the airfield.
The f>our pasengers were slightly injured.
Around 14:00 drama occurred at the ai?r?port in Kottingbrunn o?n Sunday.
The landing of a he=licopte=r caused turbulence, the police confirmed to oe:24.

The police, rescue services and fir*e departme}nt were notified immediately.
A large number o^f emergency services arrived at the sit%e of the accident.
The ÖAMTC emergency re+s+cue helicopter was also cal+le+d as a precaution.

AllBright Foundatio`n Report: Women continue to be a rari[t[y on executive boards
Only 8 percent of board members w<ere female as of September 1, according to the report `#` Th+e Power of Monoculture," officially launched this Monday by t?h?e AllBright Foundation, an advance copy o<f which had been made available to the German Press Agency.
The companies will have to mak)e changes, otherwise international competitors will leave them behi-nd, said foundation CEO Wi|ebke Ankersen.
In th:e U-S, UK, or Sweden, male-only management teams have - with a f[ew exceptions - been unthinkable for some time.
The gap makes t~he German competitors less diverse, innovative, and future-oriented b,y comparison.
I$t is a different corporate culture.
The slight increase in the number of women i|n German listed companies can be specifically attributed to the positive boost from companies i@n the mid-cap index (MDa\x).
Ye`t according to Allbright data, only 6.8 percent of boards ar,e female.
In the previous year the value was s!t!ill a<t 3.8 percent.
Among th+e 30 Dax companies - pioneers in recent years - the proportion o-f women stagnated.
Mo.st recently, the<re were 26 women working on the boards.
I am sure that Dax companies will be recruiting women more consistently in the coming year - it is in the_ir ow>n best inter!est, said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement showed no commi{tment to increase the “ zero percent ” t?o date.
The supervisory boards paint a different pic+ture: As of September 1, the proportion of women was 30..5 percent - 45 more women a"nd 68 fewer men than a ye#ar ago.
If multiple women were r`ec`r`uit`ed to the boards every ye^ar, a percentage of 40 percent would be achieved in 2023, it say:s in the report.

Within the fi+rst half of year Ferrari got 69,000 euros of business profit for each sold car, Jaguar Land Rover o\nly comes to a~round 800 euro|s, whereas Tesla and Bentley do no?t put emphasis on their income from each car.

In Bonn: Emergeny ambulance crashes int;o a taxi
An ambulance is heavily damaged nex*t to a road.
A 27-year old passenger was fatally injured w*hen th'e ambulance collided with a taxi.
Wh[en emergency responders are called, they are supposed t~o help - preferably even save lives.
Such a rescue trip in Bonn had a fatal end for a 26 y^ea^r ol/d.

Ma|nchest|er United loses again, Mourinho ’ s situation is bec.oming uncomfortable
After the embar=assi=ng e,x,it from the League Cu_p Manchester United now receives a loss in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Agai@nst West Ham United ManU looses 1:3 . T/he way of defeat certainly will remain a matter of discussion.
The scene in the 74th mi*nute, when recovered Marko Arnautovic scored f-or West Ham 3:1, was symbolic; on}ly three minutes after Marcus Rashford appeared to bring the Red D+evil+s back into the game.
As the team sus.pec.ted an offside in the pass by Mark Nobel, all of Manchester ’ s defensive players froze in posi+tion, giving Arnautovic all t\he time in t|he wo'rld to shoot the ball past the helpless David de Gea.
It was the negative climax of a very inadequate performance o)ver long s%tretches.
The mood o_f United ’ s city rival, Manchester City is quite diff\e\ren\t.
The Citizens coached b<y Mourinho ’ s big rival P(ep Guardiola scored against Brighton & Hove Albion for an unchallenged 2#:0 win.
After h~a~lf an hour Raheem Sterling made the first breakthrough, through the de?fense of the outsiders, for the hom@e team.
After a good ho_ur Sergio Agüer&o secu@re@d the way for the sixth win in seven game, through a double pass of the previous goal scorer, which sprung the team to the top o)f the table.
Liv:erpoo:l is no longer table leader
Three days after losing 1:2 at the League Cup, Xherdan Shaqir~i foug%ht a 1:1 w#ith Liverpool against Chelsea in the Premier League.
A,s a>t the Cup exit the Belgian Eden Hazard was the best man for the London team.
T(he 27-year-old ’ s goal in the 25th minute was the only go"al of match until the final phase.
Shaqiri, who replaced Mohamed Salah in the 66t>h m&inute only closely missed the tie goal after 70 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge made i#t better in the 89t<h minute with his curl.
After the Reds started the we?ek with a flawless rec%or%d, Chelsea were unbeatable for the second time.
First, the London team eliminated the team of Jür}g}en Klopp in the Cu:p, b,y the draw in the League, the Blues removed Liverpool now also fr#om the top of the table.
Like City, the two London clubs ce_le_brated 2:0 wins agai}n}st Tottenham (in Huddersfield) an{d Arsenal (against Watford).
Th+e fans of the Gunners, under whose ey$es Granit Xhaka played, against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire, however, had to wa]it until the 8[1st minute wait for a success message.
Nine minutes before the end of the game the Wat;for;d defende^r Craig Cathcart unle{ashed a cross-field ball past Alex Iwobi into one ’ s own net . O>nly two minutes later Mesut Özil scored h:is third goal of the season which was decisive.
Arsenal p\ass\ed Watford thanks t&o its fifth successive win and are now f|ifth, just behind the great rivals Tottenham . Wolverhampton continues to leav<e a strong impression as a team climbing in positio$n under the Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten f$o$r the fifth time i<n a r%ow in the League with a 2:0 win over Southampton which places them in the eighth place.
VW core bra)nd missing: Paris Motor Show marked by diesel de"bate
The Parisian automob:ile show takes place every two years i+n rotation with the IAA in Frankfurt.
Paris - Officially not an issue and yet immanent The diesel scandal and struggle for bans on driving and upgrading should not let German car companies t;ake part i:n the in&dust&ry m&eeting in Paris.
Next week they wil'l be showing their new products at the 2018 Motor Show in the capital of French together w$ith its competitors fr!om all over the world.
The diesel does not really matter n#ow.
The possible exch`ang`e and modernization offers for diesel engines owners in Germany, which are yet to be negotiated with t+he go$vernme$nt in Berlin, should still b`e an important topic at least behind shiny exhibition stands.
A big name is missing in Paris: The Volkswagen grou[p is there with Audi, Porsche and other subsidiaries, b%ut n=ot with the VW core brand itself.
Here are presented Aud#i and Mercedes-Benz, including their first pure-electric models: The e-tron of th;e Ingolstadt should come on the market at t?he end of th"e year, the EQC from Stuttgart 2019.
Bot.h were officially presented however.
The launch of BMW iNext is scheduled f~or 2021.
I.n the foc\us of attention in Paris is the new 3ER.
This year from October 4 to 14, mor&e th-an 250 exhibitors are being represented.
In additi^o^n to the car companies, motorcycle manufacturers and numero'us mobility service and software providers will be there in their i@n@di@vidual halls.
The trade sh+ow, w;hi;ch is celebrating its 120th birthday this year, takes place every two years in rotation with the IAA in Fr;ankfurt.
In 2016 came over one mi.llio.n visitors.
A?t least 380 people have lost their lives on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi d=u=ring th_e severe earthquakes and subsequent tsunami.

The island was sh@aken on Friday by two earthquakes.
The first quake was o=f magnitude 5.9, the second of m)agni)tude 7.4.
Communications and transpo,rt links have been damaged among the severe property d~a~mage.
After th,e earthquake the tsu-nami erupted over the west coast of Sulawesi.
I|n the coastal town Palu, hundreds ha?d gathered on the beach for a festival.
I?t i[s feared that the number of victims will definitely increase.
Numbers are so far on@ly from Palu.
But numerous other communities along Sulawesi '#s west coa<st are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate a church service in Werdoh[l
On Sunday, Motorcycle pastor Frank Sch#rö#der (right) from Herne, celebrated the concluding service with a team of he,lpe,rs for motorcyclists i:n the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square in front o-f the Friedenskirche in Eveking belonged to the m'otorcyc'lists on Sunday.
After all, the concluding service for the bikers was t/o be held her&e.
Frank Schröder is the motor pastor i;n the Evangelical church of Westphalia and is therefore responsible f`or the pastoral interests of the hig~h-HP cyclists.
Between April an)d September o*n the last Sunday of the month, the traditional motorcycle service (MoGo) takes place a:t Nordhelle house.
The bikers traditionally ce"lebr"ate the en}d of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
There, some 150 bikers gathered on Sunday for a church service th_at was anything but ordina!ry.
St.ar.ting from 10 am, the heavy bikes lined up in front of the entranc$e portal of the church.
The biker br>unch was the first agen"da item a|nd attendees had a chance to tuck into some coffee and cake or even a hearty Currywurst.
In addi[tion to the MoGo team, the Holy Riders, a Christian motorc_ycle group from Gummersbach, were a\l\so in attendance.
Priest Dirk G:rz:egore:k g^ave a sermon during the biker church service.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill accompanied the service with he:r music.
Al^though the bikers prefer the Blues-Rock, Valerie Lill str;uck rather calm and poetic notes, said p(astor Frank Schröder.
Th!i!s was definit[e[ly a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yesterday.
Füchtorf's Ho?me Associatio$n celebrates a major festival: The milk comes after the apple
And Borisch was also active o`n t}he actual day of action.
She provided h\er hungry guests with freshly made apple panca'kes.
Georg Hartmann-Niemerg also aroused a big am!ount of interest.
He had his ap]ple press in his luggage and demonstrated the life of an apple to hi]s astonished spectators step by step from t<he ripe apple to apple juice.
Every now a|nd then, Hartmann-Niemerg had help from the children to f*ill the apples in the big funnel.
With a little musc.l.e power, the apples became a finely chopped m+a+ss.
Not many of the children co(uld imagine h=ow a tasty drink was to be made from it.
But they could ev~en witness this important step on th#e late Friday afternoon.
Packed in molds and wrapped in nets, G&eorg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked the apple pieces layer by la!yer, whic>h looked a bit like chopped shreds.
Thanks t>o certain technical support, the last work step was n&ow no longer so difficult.
The freshly pressed juice gradually ran into a b$ig ves}s}el.
But the Füchtorf fa$rmer also had b-ottl-ed specialties with him.
So he opened his “ treasure chest ” a"n"d presented th}e l>ate>st Federweisser [alcoholic beverage] to the older visitors.
T-here was a lot o_f demand for the good “ Made in Füchtorf ” beverage.
In a comfortable atmosphere, the parents got t/o talking while the children were no"t only able to follo=w the process of p!re!ssing apples, but also discovered the bouncy castle that had been set up.
Active members of the Füchtorf comradeship of f$ormer soldiers were also involved in the festival an>d invit}ed people to join in fun games at several stations.
The Ho(me Association wi=ll also offer an action day next year.
Then, however, emphasized Gregor Krützkamp, the community cente.r in the heart of th/e asparagus village will not be the site of the act=ion.
In.stead, a farmer will be visited.
That is als#o obvious because of the topic: B-e-cause then, it will all be about milk.
1:4 against Frankfurt: Hannover facing fourth washo\ut this sea.s.on: "Shitty situation"
Frankfurt / M&ain Af[ter their f<ourth Bundesliga defeat in a row, coach André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed players from Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
However, there w<ere not many positives to take away from the bottom team ’ s earlier 1:,4 (0:2) re_s_ult at Eintracht Frankfurt.
I%t is a crappy situation, but you have to co<me out on the other side as a team, said 96 p`la`ye`r Pirmin Schwegler, adding: "This i.s of course disappointing, because you always try for the best re#sult possible".
Victory continues to elu*de the players from Lower Saxony, fo=r wh!om only Florent Muslija (86 .) scored to narrow the gap . They remain at the bottom of the table with only two points and mus&t be considered a relegation candidate in their curren&t form.
By contrast, an e#xcellent Ante Rebic led Frankfurt to celebrate their first home win of th;e season.
Evan Obite Ndicka in the 36th minute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonathan de Guzmán (59th) and Luka Jovic (89th) scored for the DFB Cup winners in front of 46,,3,0,0 spe*ctato*rs . Aft.er the successful dress rehearsal fo>r the Europa League match aga}i}nst Lazio, Frankfurt move into the middl~e of the ta^ble on seven points.
Croatia ’ s Vic`e World Champion Rebic was involved in almost every dangero?us offensive move by the Hessians at his starting eleven debut while Hanno(ver ’ s def{ens{e struggled to reign him in.
The striker battered after the World Cup, showed b_y his tempo and assertiveness why he is so valuab;le for E=intr=acht.
Besides Rebi(c, th+e Brazilian Allan, on loan from Liverpool FC, was called u;p to Frankfurt ’ s starting eleven for t%he first time and the team got off to a dynamic start.
The first sign of danger came in the form of L~ucas Torró ’ s header (17th), whi^ch was deflected into t#he netting.
Six minutes la[ter, Sébastien Haller was stopped by 96 ’ s defense i&n a promising position . The defenders w\ere led by the Brazilian Felip:e, in for Kevin Wimmer, who suffered a last-minute back injury.
The home side ’ s lead w@as all but inevitable and completely justi`fied.
After a defended corner kick, Filip Kostic l.ifted the ball into th+e box and Haller headed it in front of the goal, where Ndi{cka only had to tap i`t in.
It was the first Bundesliga goal for the defender from F|rench second division team AJ Auxerre who h*ad joined t^he club during the summer.
And Frankfurt increased t=he tally before the break.
This time, Haller passed to his fell%ow striker Rebic, who skillfully dribbled through t)he lines leaving 96 goalkeeper Michael Esser no cha^nce.
At half-time Hannover Coach Breitenreiter reacted t:o the weak performance of his elev"en and brought in Bobby Wood and Hendrik Weydandt, tw}o new attackers.
The Lower Saxony side showed more courage going forward b]ut could not come up with any dazzling ideas un*til just be`fore the end of the m#atch when they at least managed to score and narrow the gap.
The Hessians wer)e much more efficient.
Afte"r just under an hour Rebic started a solo and then crossed to De Guzmán, who just tapped the ba~ll int;o the empty goal.
Playing against overstretched guests, Frankfurt could take it easy for the rest of the match, which also saw Jovic scoring w_ith o^ne minute t~o go.

The festival service takes place at the town c@hurch, followed by a procession to t_he Church of t$he Holy Cross with the blessing.
At the Church of the Holy Cros^s lies Christus, who witnessed the Thi\rt\y Years' War and i^s said to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Blood flowed from the gunshot woun(d.
This resulted in a great pilgrimage to the Christus' resting place, which then le`d to th\e construction of the Church of the H^oly Cross.
The construction i+s not finished yet, only t?he sanctuary is, t<he missing nave is indicated by the trees.
In his homily, Father Adolf Buhl remin\ds us that the cross is a sign o/f hope, comfort and l@ife.
Inspite of the importance for the G`eising parish, attendance was r>ather poor.
After the service, the procession to the Church of the Holy Cross took place and th@e final blessing concluded the ecclesiastical part o$f the cross f,esti,val.
The Catholic church choir ha!s been inviting people to the secular part of th#e festival in the Catholic parish hom)e for many years.
The choir members provided visitors with hea=rty food and a big selection of cakes and, appropriate for t-he weather, farm-fresh ic@e cream.
In the afternoon, the parish offered guide@d tours around the ci*ty ch:urc:h, Bernd Bendschneider and Pet^ra Schmid-Seger informed the visitors on behalf of the parish about th!e damage to the facade, roof, the sandstone works and windows and the upcoming construction, which wil-l last until next year.
After t?he sc'affo'ld has been standing for some time, the damage could be more accurately determined and the individual calls for bids could be prepare m,ore concretely.
It is certain that the renovation is more expensive than planned, bec{a{use the already ex_istin_g damage hase worsended over the l$ast few years, but also more damaged has been uncovered, which was o`n`ly possible through t.he inspection by means of the scaffold.
The p-li-nth plastering work is com-pleted and before the winter, the natural stone work will begin and t)he involved parties hope to finish about half of this w}ork this year.
Opening ceremony: Ne\w res\idential home in Neu-Ulm ’ s Münsterblickstraße
The Dona+u-Iller life aid is opening a new ho|stel for people with disabilities in Münsterblickstraße.
All those at?tending the ceremony agreed t{hat "a very special house" is no]w opening its doors for its intended purpose.
A{fter all, t@he twelve wheelchair users who have been living in the residential home provided by Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time, depend on its unique archi&tec&ture.
Wider aisles, hallways and doors, la)rger rooms and barrier-free access f#or all a,reas have all been part of architect Rudolf Bader ’ s concept.
Planning first began a_bout eight years ago, when the former US Army officers ’ building was te!sted for its suitability for r!esiden!ts with disabilities: "The house was getting old and no longer up-=to-date in terms o^f features," Bader explained looking back.
In 2016, excavators started rolling t=o demolish the ho<use.
The new building was to b^e desig)ned to be as welcoming and bright as possible, so that the residents could fee!l comfortable in it, says the architect.
Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller opens new reside|ntial home
The life aid invested approximately 4.6 million e.uro in th/e new construction.
The state of Bavaria contributed 2.4 million Euros, the distri#ct o%f Swabia 450,000 Euros.
According to architect Bader, the construction work ha{s remained w'ithin the planned framework - both in terms of time an]d financially.
T@h@e Lebenshilfe ’ s managing director Jürgen Heinz thanked Bader this accom'plish'ment.
The balance between a barrier-free and fireproof desig(n h]as not always been easy.
Nevertheless, the planners and handymen built a ho+me with many specifications, to allow residents the freedom to move eve#n without o*utside help.
The same was expressed by the head of soc<ial services in the Schwaben district, Gertrud Kreutmayer: ‘ The home is g}e}a}red towards the special requirements of its re*s*idents, w/ho need help with mobility ’.
Comfort and functionality have been combined to good effect in th`e process, said K|reu|tmayer.
And also: ‘ The property in this location is a rea(l stroke of luck, because it no longer need+s to be acquired i&n today ’ s sit%uat%ion ’.
All in all, the new residential home on Münsterblickstrasse houses 30 people with disabilities on alm"ost 1,500 square meters, div.ided into three res|idential groups.
Lebenshilfe managing director Heinz is pr=oud of the eleven full-time employees, all of whom are pa/id union wages.
Germany: Schwesig complains about differences between Ea_st and West
Berlin - Prior to the anniversary of German unification, t<h<e v%i%ce-pre%si%dent of the S$PD, Manuela Schwesig, appealed to the nation n~ot to resign themselves to the discrimination of East Germans.
There are differences that hurt afte;r a=lmost 30 years of unity
W!e can no"t permit ourselves to be satisfied with these differences, ” said the minister president of Mecklen:b:urg-Vorpo:m:mern to the “ Tagesspiegel ” on Sunday.
The goals must remain the same: to create equal living cond=i=tions across the cou(ntry.
It is unacceptable that East Germans wo,rk longer on a+ver+age than people in Western Germany, but rec-eive 15 percent less salary.
This i^s inexplicable, nearly 30 yea@rs after the German Unification, said Schwesig.
N[orth Korea: Is this cute dog going to end the Korean c>on>flict?
The one-year-old Pungsan hunting d}og is to pour oi/l on troubled water between the two Koreas.
In an effort to ease ties with Seoul, Pyongyang has given the South Korean President Moon Jae I/n two North Korean Pungsan hounds a(s a gif[t.
O>n Sund_ay, Moon.s office announced that both dogs, about a year old reached the recipient already on Thursday.
They passed through the Pa}nmunjom border with three kilograms o[f dog food, to help the an/imals ‘ to settle in ’.
The dogs with their thick, white fur, pointed ears and brown eye^s are loyal an?d intelligent.
They belong t+o t^he national cultural heritage of the People ’ s Democratic Republic of Korea.
Th?e friendship gift was announ%ced by the North at the third summit meeting this year between Moon and the North Korean ruler Kim Jong Un in mid-September in P<yongyang.
Both countries also agreed to compete together in internation"al sports competitions such as th&e 2020 Olympic Games and to make a joint candidanc_y for the 2032 Olympic Games.
In the process of the mutual rapprochement, Kim agreed to close the Tongchang R#i test system fo/r rocke~t propulsion.
99 documents reflect Austria's eventful his(tory
What is Austri[a?
At the 100-year anniversary of the republic that has been celebrated in this commemorative year for alm{ost ten months, m}any new books appear_e_d that ans/wer this question mainly looking back over the past hundred years.
Wolfgang Maderthaner, histor(ian and director-general of the Austrian State Archives, t=a=kes a very different approach in the magnific\ent "picture book" of Austria, which will be published o,n October 1.
A new week, a new opportunity for the g+overn+ment
Back to regulatory work - this is t!he unoffici>al motto for the working w`eek of the grand coalition starting today.
Hardly an interview, hardly a speech i.n which the Chancellor and her ministers from the CDU, SPD and als<o last*ly fro)m the CSU did not invoke the mantra "return to work".
That may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and other working people in this country to the legitimate question of w~h~at the d#iff#erence r>eally is between work and paperwork, but tha*t's all.
Now the federal government is ready to devote itself aga"in to the ta,sk of gov-erning, they should not be distracted from this now with debates on terminology.
Whether Union an(d SPD can pull off something together after th|e provocations and disgraces o&f recent weeks, will possibly be seen on Monday.
T~he leaders of the g\o\v\erning parties will come together for the coalition committee in the evening.
Chancellor Angel`a Merkel now wants to summon this session regularly, to de[fuse conflicts early on; lessons c{an be learned from all the disputes.
First o?f all, however, conflict-laden topics are on the ag%enda again with the diesel retrof;its and the skilled labor immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer w>ants the car companies to get off lightly wi<th an exchange premium - SPD and CDU consider the manufac?turers to be under obligation to technically retrofit o/lder diesels.
While over the weekend a rapprochement has emerged in the di_esel crisis, the Union an\d SPD are still far apart in the planned skilled labor immigration l|aw.
T.he SP;D promotes a long-term perspective for failed asylum-seekers, who work or who are training.
The Union i)s strictly against the "t(rack change" from the asylum system into the labor market.
There will be disputes amongs[t the coalition partners again - how coul%d this be otherwise?
No%t equal and equal ha\s joined forces to form the grand coalition, but three partners with sometimes very dif{ferent images of society and priorities.
Dispu@te is good.
Without d_ispute, a subscribed society of such diverse, sometimes cont^radictory interests does not progress.
But to be constructive, dispute should not be exaggerated again for party tactical reasons regarding the question of bein+g o&r not-#being.
I}t is about politics, not theater.
Union a!nd SPD are t$o argue - but must alwa(ys have the reality of life of the people in view.
What is possible and i`s of benefit to many?
With this ke+y question, both the diesel and the track change question can be pragmatically clarified - and confi,de,nce ther?e?by regained.
Above all, that is what th~e people's parties must now fight f*or.
Pilz i}s investigating the Hartinger ’ s working hours
Close eyes on Mi>nister
Is the Mi@nistor for Labor in vio\lation of labor law?
Daniela Holzing]er wants to investigate this in more detail.
Serious)l)y, day a;nd night, her legists h\ad worked on the social security reform, reported the so;c;ial minister at the presentation of the reform two weeks ago exuberantly.
Liste Pilz candidate Daniela Holzinger is surprised by Beate Ha[rting[er-Klein ’ s statement (F^PÖ) - she brings this to t@he parliament ’ s attention now.
She assumes that ‘ the minister is o(nly trying t>o express her enthusiasm about the engagement of her team, and did not intend t*o convey any possib@le violations of the labor law with the cameras rolling ’.
Nevertheless, now ther+e are unanswered questions to acquit Ha]rti]nger "of any suspicion."
The poli<ce dig up a road i-n search of a woman ’ s corpse
Marxgrün - Lange did not wan<t to comment o'n the matter to the police.
Now there is confi!rmation.
Since early Saturday morning digging has taken pla"ce on the state road be\tween Naila and Bad Steben.
The track i,n the Marxgrün are;a will be closed until Monday.
Earli_er it had taken place t<hat the investigator had used an archeology dog.
The dog together with his gui[de, trained especially for the smell of old human bones, was finally able to limit t'he relevant area t+o a few metres.
A soil anomaly wa#s also discovered with scientists from Munich ’ s T[echn[ical University and t!he supreme Bavarian monument protection authority in the area of the road section mentioned.
For more than a yea\r already the prosecutor and Criminal Police from Hof had worked on t-he case of t+h+e missing.
A cycle track was closed again a[nd again at Marxgründ and investigated with sonar equipment, because th(e investigators suspected that He(ike ’ s body could have been buried during the new construct&ion of the state ro/a/d 30 years ago.
Colored powder and eggs: Prote;st;s in Barc\elona before the Catalonia ’ s anniversary
The controversial in#d#ependence referendum took place o]n Monday in Catalonia.
B=ut right before it begun the protests.
The aut}umn 2017 police operat(ion was not forgotten by the separatists.
Barcelona - Shortly before the annive(rs(ary of th`e Catalan independence referendum o,n 1 October 2017, in the downtown of Barcelona separatists clashed with police.
Among other things Catalan security forces were attacked by pro-independence activists with colored powder, as t]h]ey wer>e trying t}o prevent them from approaching t.he demonstration of National Police and Civil Guards.
With the demonstration about 3,000 police officers from the Pol"i"cía Nacional and Guardia Civil police units wan^ted to honor their colleagues who performed their duties in the polls last y|ear during th!e illegal referendum.
An attempt to p@revent citizens from voting lead t,o violence.
The Spanish media reported that th.e Catal+an police formed a chain to keep the separ@atists and central security forces apart.
However, some of the about 6000 separatists tried t-o break the po[lice chain b>y force, and were th*rowing at officials, among other things, paint bombs and eggs.
Citing the authorities it was said that six people h;ad been arrested and 24 other were slightly i$nju$red.
The independence referendum took place for th.e first time on Mo/n/d/ay.
Following the vote and subsequent decision to spli|t off the prosperous region from Spain, i\n autumn 2017 the central government in Madrid put Catalonia under con}trol.
The former regional pr=esiden=t Carles Puig'demont has fled to Belgium.
Other politicians also e@scaped abroad.
However, several ministers of then regiona}l government and other activists of the separatist mo@vement remain in custody.
In December in the region w>ere held new elections.
After the new Catalan government's inauguration in May, t=he forced ad;m;inistration was terminated.
Yet t'he new presid/ent insists on the ‘ Right of self-determination ’ of Catalans.
Football: Oberliga Westfalen: Complete helplessness: Goalless matc%h be't'ween FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen
Rot-Weiß A$hlen still going nowhere.
FC Gü_tersloh only di[dn ’ t get further than a 0-0 draw.
Th:e tail light and the third last of the league demonstrated com}p}l}ete helplessness in front o?f 438 spectators at Heidewald stadium.
The first half w?as ra\ther dim in terms of entertainment.
Anyone who wanted to go get a beer or br[at[wurst could do it without worrying they wou{l{d miss anything.
There was no risk of missing a goal opportuni-ty, because there were virtually no%ne.
The fi@rst shot on goal happened afte!r half an hour.
Respon=sible for the first (harmless) shot on goal was Gütersloh ’ s Nick Flock in minu~te 28.
The best - and in principle only real - opportunity h>ad the team from Ahlen, when FCG goalkeeper Fred,e,ric Westergerling save]d Cihan Yilmaz ’ shot on goal from the edge of the penalty area in minute 3]2.
The hosts were even more har<mless.
Their mo:st effective action was an early substitution.
Striker Lars S+chrö+der had t[o be replaced due to injury . Sinan Aygün replaced him.
After the substitution, both te,ams decided to do something against t_he growing boredom.
In minute 48, Sebastian Mützel shot just ov.er the go!al from 18 meters and after on{e hour the Gütersloh player also appeared offensive for the very first time.
After a ball recapture by Matthäus Wi$ec$kowicz, this was quickly dealt w;ith.
Nick Flock (mi;nu;te 62) "crowned" the quick co&un&terattack o|ver Sinan Aygün with a lax shot into the arms of RWA goalkeeper Bernd Schipmann.
In addition, they went o[ne better with a header from Wieckowicz (minute 66) a#f#ter a corner from forme]r Ahlen player Tim Manstein.
R_WA inter*im coach Angelo Daut responded, substituting Mart,in Fuhsy for Marko Onucka (minute 60) and a little later Se!bastian Mützel for Enes Güney (minute 70).
T-hat lead to nothing.
The t`eam from Ahlen di;d not achieve more than optical superiority thanks to their own initiative.
Only in the 91st m.inute did Cihan Yilmaz have the last chance, bu_t that did n&ot get them anywhere.
A$ngelo Daut tried t|o emphasize the positive afterwards: "I like tha:t we kept a clean sheet ." But unfortunately, both sides scored zero.
We were not as dangerous against goal in this match a?s against Holzwickede, e/ven though our opponents d^id not w~ant to play here, states RW Ahlen ’ s interim coach.
Offensively, "everything just happened somehow '<' against a team that "just wanted to de~fen~d.
At any rate, I did not feel that w~e could concede a goal, '%' said Daut.
To h`is chagrin, however, the vie.wer did not feel like his team could scor&e a goal, either.
The performance wa.s too poor for that.
Thanksgiving Market i_n Reckenfeld: Goo+d thing there are enough Kreimers
That is good news for Brigitte Ran+smann, Petra Gronem,an,n, and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld food bank, for whom these dona@tions are intended.
The volunteers clarify: "These d!onations will remai(n in Reckenfeld."
At the opening the s}ky was a brilliant blue, but the square was a little empty, which was to chan.g.e over t}he day.
Be#cause: "It is such a friendly atmosphere, that is why we are here today," sa+id one vi@sitor.
Organizer o|f the festival Franz Josef Holthaus welcomed the gu^ests in a Kiepenkerl outfit as always w:ith a bit of humor.
At sho~rt notice, Ferdi and Marcel Kreimer stood in for the Brockmanns, who were t:o be weighe-d against food.
Ferdi Kreimer ’ s daughter Verena had fallen i\ll.
But there a)re enough Kreimers anyway.
And the "substitute" insisted o+n musically entertaining t+he ever increasing number of visitors.
This w=as so well received that people sang along to some folk songs la(te at night.
Just great, said a de%light%ed Marcel Kreimer.
Thi@s year, mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to accommodate the openin.g date in his schedule.
H$e is happy to see so many engaged people ma/nning their sta{nds, most of them hailing from clubs and associations.
Strictly speaking, there should be n'o need for thing`s like foo*d banks, he said when thanking the men ’ s choir for their efforts.
Andreas Hajek praised everybody ’ s engagement, in th-e stands, and also included the additional festivals that to`ok place in September and the ‘ clean-up ’ ac_ti_on.
Our garden city is ge~tting a colorful coat o~f paint - things are really happening.
Next, th`e wreath wa|s taken down from the maypole by Georg Knorr and Gerd Klück with the help of the fire departmen:t and taken into winter storage.
Many st}ands worked to provide sustenance.
Everything from sweet to savory wa~s available.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has bee<n living in Rec/kenfeld for a year, was creative about his scroll saw.
He offered vene'er de)signs and beer mats with typical Reckenfeld motifs, among other things.
Three Reckenfeld b^eekeepers offered a special treat: "Reckenfeld honey '-', brought by Maria-Theresia Smolka, Christian Wedershov{en and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.
Th:e latter has another specialty on hand.
Gingerbread i[n a glass, with ho@ney from my own production of course.
Little Elsa kept coming ba\ck for seconds, that is how good t,he cake was.
It is t$his friendly atmosph;ere that makes visito.rs stay late into the evening hours even in the absence o<f stage events, which are not part of the fall festival.
Gra)ffiti w#ith a local political message: Unsuccessful advertising for a skate park
In Lengerich, unknown people have ad;voc;ated for the construction of a skate park in a h:ardly beneficial way.
In s=e=v=er=al places, t%here are graffiti, says Jürgen Kohne of the city administration on th|e request of the WN.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint f`or property damage has been filed wit*h the police.
T$he three words "Skatepark for Lengerich!" are displayed in large letters o#n signs, among others at t,he Gempt-Halle and the Old Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, manager of the h_al_l, reports that writing wa*s found on the advertising sign on the sta{ircase to the Gempt Bistro o&n September 19 after the career choice fair.
Since th|e short message was apparently "only" made with a marker, it could easily b(e removed.
A few days later, it was there aga]in, but this time it w`as spra-yed on, says Rottmann.
He assumes that the respective advertising sig%n has to be re:placed.
This case is special by the fa`ct tha;t several large companies from Lengerich are mentioned on the board.
If the skate park is built, it(s realization will also be made possibl)e by sponsors.
The,re are already pledges, expla%ins Jörg Hesselmann from the urban department of schools, sports a!nd culture, without naming names.
It is possible, however, that one or more of the sponsors are iden,tical to t^hose companies that are on the graffitied b+oard.
For years, l=ocal politics an_d administration have been dealing with the topic of a skate park.
After the old had been dismantled at th#e LWL clinic, the search for an alternative location be>gan.
The council finally chose the fi=re department parking lot.
However, this request was not implemented - appa(r(en(tly, t"oo many factors were against a construction at this poi&nt.
At the end of June, it w&as all turned ar;oun;d again.
Members of the main and financial committee now voted unanimously for the area o_f the Gute.nberg school.
Regarding t`he state of affairs, Jürgen Kohne sa%ys that the administration is currently in the mi"ddle of concrete planning.
Th{en, city council has the last word.
H%e assumes a decision will be reached this year, so that park can b~e built in 2019.
Bottlenecks in air traffic contro_l are getting even worse
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the chaos affecting European air traffic in th~e summer, G\er\man air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement i;n the coming year.
This year it was only wind, 2019 we will have strong wind and the storm will hit a`fter that, head of the German air traffic union, Matthias Maas, told t=he German Press A_genc_y ahead of th-e aviation summit on October 5 in Ham\b\urg.
He said that the well known staff shortages plaguing European air traffic controllers are an important rea;son for the numerous delays an-d flight cancellations an_d tha^t there is no quick fix to this problem.
Ai#r#lines and airports can make quick improvements for the coming year, but training new air traffic controllers takes four to fiv=e years, the union^ist said.
He added t$hat there are hardly any fully trained air traffic controllers available on the European ma_rket.
He pointe%d ou?t that the Karlsruhe center monitoring Germany ’ s upp%er air space alone is short of some one hundred staff.
Maas again criticized the fact that d.iffer.ent air transport trade un(ions were not invited to the summit.
Representat$ives from federal and state governments, air traffic controllers, t]he airlines, and the airports gather on Friday to tackle the causes o*f the delays.
If you want to talk about additional w|ork and overtime, that will not work without us, said t@he head o>f the German air traffic union, many members of which work for t`he federally owned German air traffi-c control company DFS.
Maas again held the EU Commission ’ s guidelines responsible for the a:ir traffic control p:redica:me:nt.
He asserted that traffic forecasts for the regulatory period up to 2019 h<ad been far t&oo low.
The resu_lt_ing cost targets and personnel savings a*t the national air traffic control services now have a seve=re impact on daily operations, he stressed.
Ma,as appealed t~o Federal Transport Minister Andreas Scheuer (CSU), to promote regulations in B_russels that would not "keep on depriving air traffic controllers of oxygen '@'.
H_e cautioned that, as things s>tand, the EU targets would b-e coordinated by 2024 and further tightening is to be expected.
According to Maas, the EU is exposed t"o constant lobbying pressure from t"he airlines.
Ryan_air boss, Michael O'Leary and his colleag;ues have now re~ape~d exactly what they have sown in recent years, said Maas.
He hopes t%hat the high costs incurred b-y the air]lines as a result of delays will lead them to think again.
The German ai%r traffic union would work to improve t^he situation only if the DFS were to offer a "coherent agreement f+or future-oriented t"raini"ng and education," said Maas.
He furthe"r noted that the previously announced intake of 120 air traffic control students per year over the next five years is just e~no~ug~h to com|pe|nsate fo|r age-related personnel reductions.
It does not yet address the necessary sta;ff expansion.
Thyssenkrupp supervisory board votes for grou'p restructuring
The members of the Thyss=enkrupp Supervisory Board unanimously voted in favor of the plans f*or t'he reorganization of the Group.
A]ccord]ing to the wishes of Thyssenkrupp interim head, Guido Kerkhoff, who was appointed to t)he meeting on Sunday for th\e management board, the crisis-hit grou=p will be split into two independent companies.
Both companies will have their register{ed office in Essen and will be listed o^n the stock exchange.
There will b<e no further downsizing in addition to the reductions a(lready known about.
After two withdrawals, the supe?rvisory body only has eight heads o/n the capital side.
And there ar.e ten employee representatives.
The final decision will be made in a general meeting plan$ned in 20~20.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is t}o hold a 50-percent share from the merged steel business wi`th Ind"ian partner Tata.
T:he second company, Thyssenkrupp Industrials AG, is to be bundled with the e-levat-or and subcontracting business.
Barcelona: Police brutality a(nd violent Catalan independence a+ct+ivists at demonstrations.
Violent clashes by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence ac/tivist/s in Barcelona wit_h numerous casualties at two concurrent demonstrations.
According to th_e ci~ty administration, about 3000 police officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as about 6000 independence act#ivis#ts demonstrated.
The Catalan police tried to keep the tw}o protesting groups awa$y from each other.
According to deploy-ment forces, advocates f(or independence again tried to break through the security barrier.
They attacked the officers with paint and thrown ob~jects.
Brawls between the participants of the two protesting g&rou&ps were a?lso reported.
24 people w>ere injured according to the rescue forces.
The police stated ther$e have been six arrests.
Better salaries an-d appreciation of colleagues
The police had wanted to pay tribu#te to their colleagues who had opposed the ind|epende|n|ce refe[re[ndum in Catalonia banned almost exactly a year ago by the Spanish central government.
They demanded better salaries at the same tim[e.
Members o}f the Spanish police and the Guardia Ci(vil thought it was unfair tha{t Catalan and Basque police officers were earning much more than they were.
The demonstrators found it provocative that the Spanish police d}emonstrated in Barc^elona of all places.
Why d-id they come here to protest? The 55-year old Catalan demonstrator Manel Pere,z asked the news agency AF^P.
Simply to provoke and t\o celebrate the fact that they worked us over a year a}go.
A 31-year-old policeman from the Balearic Islands, who said his n:ame is Daniel, rejected the ac[cusation.
Of course we wan$t to support ou+r comrades who were only doing their job a year ago: d(efend(ing the law, he said.
But the demonstration is here to en+force o{ur rights a)nd we're doing it in Barcelona, be.cause it is a major European city and there is more echo here.
However, he and his colleagues di*d “ not come here to provoke, ” th]e policeman ensured us.
Crash allowed access t*o personal data of British minister
A security hole i.n a mobile app led to the personal data of ministers and representatives of the C*ons*ervative British Tory pa#rt#y on Saturday being temporarily accessible to anyone.
According t.o Br\itish media reports, many ministers received calls from unknowns after th[e crash, one day before the Tory party conference in Birmingham.
Two people clamped o"n B217
O}n Sunday morning the Hanover police reported a heavy traffic acc\ident on the federal highway 217, Hamelner Chaussee, a+t the outskirts o"f Wettbergen in the direction of Ronnenberg.
Two people died af}ter driving their car into a tr}ee.
Currently, the car is in f@lame@s.
Eme+rgenc+y services are at the scene.
The art%icle will be continually updated.
F~ootball: Juventus trainer applauds the top game: Ro^naldo ’ s best game
The Portuguese star striker ‘ this evening played the be&st game in add]itio]n t:o Valencia ’ s half hour ’, commended Juventus coach Ma:ssimiliano Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) vict'ory of the record champion against SSC Napoli.
For the coach, the expensively purchased sta]r without scoring himself w`as the decisive man of th@e match in the important game against the pursuers.
Ronaldo had a lot o*f fun and did it well, said A$llegri.
Even if we started with tactical er[rors, Ro,naldo w=as very good with our first goal and we just got better from then onwards.
Thanks to Ronaldo ’ s three assists, Ju,v,e struck back in the game aft<er being down early thr'ough the goal by Dries Mert=e=n=s (10th Minute) and in the thick of t'hings the pursuer was put off for the time being.
The goal-getter brought in from Madrid first tackled the former Bundesliga p@r@ofessional Mario M/andz/u/kic, who provided a double score (26./49 .) for th/e lead.
And Ronaldo provided the build-up wit`h a head ball from a corner shot, for the goal by the defence leader Leonardo B@onucc@i (76), who just ha<d to make a short push in, in front of t/h/e goal l@ine.
H>e gives a lot, said the trainer.
But naturally Allegri wi_ll also see goals from the attacker, who is the record goal scorer in b&ot&h the Champions League and in the Portuguese national te/am.
We have to g/et b[etter at serving him, the coach said.
Currently Mandzukic is the best Juve scorer with four go<als - Ronaldo has t"hree.
The superiori*ty of Juventus seems even more overwhelming, with the purchase of Rona=ldo, for mo@re than 100 million Euros.
S"even win(s in seven games is the flawless series in Series A . Wi]th 21 points the masters over the past s\e\ven years already have a six-point lead over Napoli.
The second team i+n the table, coached by t(he former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, wa,s not without chances against Turin.
The top match was however decided at the la'tes't after the dismissal of th$e al{r{eady warned Mario Rui (58 .).
The Portuguese afte}r a too strong pile in agai:n:st Paulo Dybala had to leave the field with a yellow-red.
We p{la{yed well against a g}ood Napoli, the Turin coach commented.
E;mre Can should also feel addressed.
The German national has asserted himself at J*uve.
The professional, who came fr'om Li/verpool, participated in all seven league matches.

K\anye West changes his name
O>n th(e weekend, with a particularly bizarre appearance, rapper Kanye West attracted attention on the US TV show `}` Saturday Night Live".
Among other things, his joint performance with Lil Pump in a mineral water costume caused rai+sed eyebrows a|nd questions among t{he spectators.
On time for t&he release of his new album, the 4/1 year old additionally announced a name change.
From now on, on"e may call him only "Ye ':', so the musician.
The artist, formerly known a)s K/an/y/e West, twittered in the style of the dead sing]er Prince, when he changed his stage name.
However, the pseudonym is n,o,t news.
The tenth album ha>s appeared under this name.
In an interview with radio stati@on KRRL the artist explains that ‘ Ye ’ ha%s a religious signific@ance for him.
I thin{k ‘ Ye ’ is the most frequently used w\ord in the bible and means ‘ you ’, the rapper s&aid.
Foot,ball: District League A1 Münster: Finally!
D#one!
Hoetmar ’ s trainer Averhage made no s`ecret of his disapp;ointme;nt.
That was a weak game by us to+day.
The oppone?nt was just easier t?o grip, we have almost never faced problems ." Accordingly thin reads th~e list of Hoetmarer bullet options.
Just two scori}ng chances in 90 m*inute*s . Not a good chance for a positive outcome.
Football District League A1: SC Hoe^tmar an"d SG Sendenhorst played 0-2 (0-1) Photo: Heinz Schwackenberg
The SG ha!d only two options in the first ro?und, but Maik Kraus*e used the first from an acute angle to secure the early lead (7).
In th@e 43rd minute, Steffen Uphus could have up[p[e[d the score, but after great preparation work by Kraus}e he missed the ball.
The hosts had only a double opportunity as Moritz Höne failed and Jan Blome al?so fou-nd his master in the Sendenhorst kee*per Jos Schuhmacher.
After halftime, the guests were even mor<e dominant and had a number of go;od opportunities.
But Uphus (minute 49), Juli^a^n T{url (minute 6-1) and Heinz Linnemann (minute 69) all failed.
A hand p_e_n_alty - Louis Kortenjann had rescued on the goal l*in*e with the hand an"d got the red card - was also not of us]e for the guests (minute 75).
Only once Ni`ls Berheide pok{ed the ball across the line was the game over (81st minute).
W`e had previously criticized ourselves hard, that was different today than in th(e last fe|w weeks, was Florian Kraus ’ conclusion.
Sendenhorst: J. Schomacher - Linnema|nn, Scholz, Eilmann, Mey, Kraus, Krause (77th minute Berhe$ide), L. Hartleif, Uphus, Abu Dalal (90t>h minute (Leib.i.g), Turl.
Goals: 0}-1 Krause (minute 7), 0-2 Berh|eide (minute 81).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football in Albachten: G\W Albersloh falls against Concord|i|a 3-4
I do not kno-w what to think of that, he struggled fo?r words.
We did n]ot get any access to them . W!i!th ‘ th{em ’, he allegedly meant the wing players Colby McGill an{d Ja\nis Kröger, but probably also all the other green and whites, who made themselves noticeable with their collective offensive urge.
He coul*d sti:ll laugh: "A filthy win, '(' he sa+id, winking cheekily and then went off . His players, on the other hand, were relieved to have gotten away with three points.
Mind you, after a duel between two teams, one of which, Albachte_n, plays for the cham(pionsh(ip and the other, Albersloh, is fighting f_or stay]ing in the league.
With understandably mixed fee(lings, GWA coach Sven Lewandowski looked back at the 9-0 minutes.
That was b{y far o:ur best performance of the season, he says.
It was phenomenal how we come back from th*e 0[-2 draw and held up against one of the league's top teams over the entire m)atch.
Hence, the more bitter it seems, that they h&ad t]o go home empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zymner sho;t his team in the le/ad with his 12th . Goal this seaso^n (minute 24).
He needed exactly two touch=e=s in this game for this goa#l.
The 2-0, he set for Fabian Fröhnin"g (minute 3]9).
We knew it, but you just c+an't completely take out a player like tha&t.
It was amazing wh&at he di~d, Lewandowski ungrudingly recognized the opponent ’ s quality.
Just before switching sides, his own team ma$n$aged to score the equalizer: Mc>Gill ’ s free kick f]ro]m the left side sailed between Hövelmann an(d Concordia goalkeeper Hinkerohe into the long goal corner (45th minute).
After swit=ching sides, it was McGill again who scored the equalizer (59t\h minute).
And then i%t went back and forth.
It was a crisp, action-packed g;ame.
Nü#be#l shocked Albachten (min-ute 64), just five minutes later Patrick Horstmann equalized again (minu-te 69).
Despite their numerical advantage, Albersloh was unable to counter the last Concord!ia goal (minute 8,0).
Now, we must focu:s on Wednesday.
The game against Schapdetten, that ’ s one we have to wi$n n_ow, said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spa.n.ge.nber.g - Hecker, Strohbücker, Adolph, Zur M|ühlen - Kröger (87th minut$e Diallo), P. Horstmann, Thale, McGill - H`övelman`n, Bonse (87th minute Bareksai).
Goals: 1-0 Zymner (minute 24), 2;-0 Fr/öhning (minute 39), 2-1 McG%ill (minu*te 45), 2-2 McGill (minute 59), 3-2 Nübel (minute 6/4), 3-3 P. Horstmann (minute 69), 4-3 Jü!lkenbeck (minute 80).
Indirect Red: Atala#n (minute 74/Albachten).

Evangelical Academy Tutzing: Prominent guests and ne{w offers
Un.til the middle of the following ye-ar the Evangelical Academy Tutzing offers about 80 meetings.
Meanwhile, France's President Emmanuel Macron has sh=own interest to personally claim the tolerance prize i}n Tutzing.
The term of office was too sho?rt for Christian Wulff: A_s Federal President he was not in Tutzing ’ s Evangelical Academ*y.
But before and after Wulff has been a$s a guest th\e\re.
This i$s how Academy Director Udo Hahn counted him i?n when he proudly said: "All Federal Presidents and Federal Chancellors have visited us". That celebrities appear again an*d again at the academy i$n Tutz%ing Castle was also an issue in the presentation of the annu;a;l program.

Satirical revue: Gender communication f$rom the heart - Wolbeck - Westf'äli'sch'e Nachrichten
Ti%na Teubner ’ s satirical revue Friday evening in the hall of the Christuskirche i|n Wolbeck was "suitable fo.r adults as well as men".
Comedian T`eubner honed in on gender communication with humor and empathy for the (stereoty}pica}l) woman and the (stereotypical) man - and anythi.n.g els>e that out there - but also with music.
They play+ed mini guitar and also mastered their violins.
Ben Süverkrüp wa/s manning the piano.
On the one hand, he is the male sparring partner, who sometimes even gets a word i#n before the end of the sentenc>e, and on th\e other, a true pianist: Süverkrüp accom?panied Teubner congenially and i=n harmony, so much so that so/me may have wished a solo.
The/n there was this, with Beethoven and Chopin, but different, so as to f{it t"he theme of the evening.
Teubner had introduced a paradox: She mused that a man is happy wh)en he h*a*s a partner but does not hold the d/oor open for her.
But that a closed door without a partner, on the other hand, offers n'o benef~it.
The piano s;olo demonstrated this very notion: How would Mozart ’ s career as a composer turned o<ut, i]f his older sister "the Nannerl '{' had suddenly opened the door?
Thus Süverkrüp slides into improvisations, from Bach ’ s "O Head full o?f blood and wounds" i<nto the `+` Death Rattle" Western theme, an+d from Mozart ’ s G m$inor Symphony into a playful little dance.
There was great applause and shouts of `%` brav{o" from the packed hall.
The association ’ s treas,urer, Karlh|einz Kleintje, presented flowers to the singer.
Bu't chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck refused to pa'rt without offering additional thanks.
She had the idea t_o treat the duo to a gig in Wolbeck in addition to their appearance*s i.n Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

Handball: Wom!e!n Division: Ahlener SG keeps a clean sheet against TV Wat[tenschei[d
The Ahl\en p[layers especially ha\d trouble with the third league player Carolin Stallmann, who scored ten goals on her own.
I was actually pretty sa*tisfied with the defense . Only one player scored to&o many goals.
We did no=t get that under control, sa!id ASG coach Dogan Aydogdu.
He was more annoyed by the many opportun+iti+es that we>re left on the table.
The focus at the end made his team m\i\s\s the vi%ctory this time.
The ASG lagged behind until the break wi.th 11:12 and lat)er still with 15:18 (minute 45).
T/owards the end, the broader bench of the hosts made a decisive imp;act.
In addition, Aydogdu Rü)ckraum put Merle Klement o+n the left wing, who then made "decisive goals in a/n extremely clever way" (Aydogdu).
ASG: Buschkötter, Bolte - Bruland (2), Pumpe, Exne#r, Klement (5), Colba~tzky (5/3), Drew(es (1), Sc~hlautmann (1), Deventer (6), Baer (1), C. Fitze)k, Ruschhaupt (4), S.. Fitzek.
Volleyball: Wom`en's 3rd League: Top performance by BSV Ostb&eve&rn in the championship game at VC Allbau Essen
Thanks to a top performance in the top game, the volleyball p(l(aye(rs of the BSV Ostbeve/rn have established themselves again in t:he top group o_f the 3 . League West.
On the home f?i?eld of relegated club ’ s VC Allb;au Essen, the blue-and-white won with 3-1.
It was a huge s(t(ep in a cool season.
I:t ’ s so muc.h fun to play in the upper third of the league.
This is what we have been working towards, says tra!iner Dominik Münch excitedly after an almost flawless performance by hi)s team at the now defeated ta#ble leader.
I#n the first part, the gues)ts dominated almost however they wanted.
With 4-1, 16[-10 and 22-12, the runner-up of the previous year won with a 25-1"5.
Essen played wi$t$h two lines, but h?as not come into play.
W_e kept them on their toes.
Our opponent struck with a high ri@sk, but also pro`duced countless penalty cards.
In the second set, the BS:V already led with 1[2-8 . "Essen changed to three lines.
We cou*ld not hold the pressure.
Essen moved in closer, and w/e l_et ourselves be lulled a bit," Münch continued.
A]t 18:17, t{he volleyball players from the Ruhr area were in front.
Alth!ough Ostbevern defended four set balls a*t 19:24, the fifth attempt found its target.
The game was now in a better class, belie"ves t;he trainer about the performance.
Maike Rüdingloh and then Wiebke Silge made huge contributions with their serves that BSV tur_ned the page i;n the third set from 14:16 to 25.:21.
Münch: "We played consistently and cal\mly."
At 7-3 and 15-=1=3, the blue-white added part four with 25:22 t[o their side.
Vera Horstmann wa|s voted as the most valuable player, but Maren Flachmeier also had an outstanding d%ay.
BS*V wom.en: Eggenhaus, Rüdingloh, Lea und Anna Dreckmann, Auen, Flachmeier, Mersch-Schneider, Si,lge, Horstmann, Roer.
International: Turkish com)mu)nit)y: Mosque opening as a missed opp[ortunity
The Turkish Community in Germany (TGD) has criticized the way the great Ditib Mo!sque was opened in C*ologne by the Tu"rkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
The op_ening of the mosque in Cologne has left a pile of shards in the German-Turkish r<ela<t<ionship, which c;an be put together only w{ith difficulty, said the chairman of the T'GD, Gökay Sofuoglu, to the editorial network Germany.
Both t%he Turkish and German side missed the opportunity t?o have a joint reconciliatory appearance.
In:stead of highlighting the Muslims ’ affilia<t<ion with Germany side by side with top German politicians, Erdogan used the ev*ent for his own purposes, complained Sofuoglu.
The w;idespread exclusion of the Germa'n public had encouraged "many reservations."
Nottuln Home Association: The offer has alr,eady been established
It ’ s Folk Festiv?al time again finally a*fter the long summer break
On October 18th (Thursda~y) at 19:30, the Heimatverein Nottuln already hosts h|is fifth Nottulner Folktreff in the fi-replace room of the old Amtmannei.
It ’ s almost exactly a y~ear to the da&y si<nce we met here for a Folk Festival for the first time.
Th.is event has now become a fixture in the musical event calendar in Nottuln, ” s?ays Hanns Moormann, chairman of t]h]e Nottuln Home Association, pleased.
I wou?ld no_t have thought that our Folktreff got established so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether it was the sto'rm Friederike in Ja+nuary or the heat wave in July, t|he fireplace room of the ‘ Amtmannei ’ was always full.
As always, the program for the next Fol%k Festiva!l is a colorful mix of Ge|rman folk, hiking and sailor songs, evergreens an old hits, says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who is always inviting musical frien+ds t{o Nottuln.
Klaus Spellmeyer has prom*ised to play his accordion for th,e first Folk Festival “ birthday . ”
H\e wa`s a member of “ Gaitling ” many years ago, a group from the neighboring district of Steinfurt, which played music wit@h Low German lyrics.
Now h'e '+s a member of an Irish folk band.
The creators of the Folk Festival fondly remember the last event in t%he summer when Christoph Schultz from the Folk Festival Emsdetten excited the audience with his international version of th"e song “ Frogs i|n t%h%e Night ” and sent them home with the song stuck in th_eir heads.
We are expecting many happy guests to spend another sociable a|nd humorous evening together, says the invitation from th~e Home Ass^ociat^ion.
Anyone who plays an instrument an"d wants to actively participate is in$vited to join in.

From clean fruit to ec@ology
The 125th a~nniversary of the District Association fo!r Gardening and Landscape Conservation w<a<s celebrated with a gala at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On September 29 18]93 a fruit s>how in the Kulmbach community hall set the last impulses for the founding of the Kreisverband für Gartenbau und Landespflege Kulmbach (District Association f%o%r Gardening and Landscape Conservation Kulmbach), and exactly 125 years later, on Saturda?y night, the association celeb:r:ated the big anniversary in t<he Kulmbac\h Stadthalle (civic centre).
Frankly the association h(ad a different name at that time: In the year 1893 th\e mayor Wilhelm Flessa ammou'nced the name as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (District Fruit Growing Association Kulmbach Ci|ty and Count,ry).
The purpos]e of the fruit-growing ass#o#ciation differed from that o[f today ’ s work - in fact, it w>as purely about fruit growing and nobody thought about flowers and gardening at that time.
A+t that time, in the era o\f the Enlightenment, t~h~e fruit tree was a favorite child of the elit:e, explained the local history curator Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fruit trees li{ned the highways, so-called industrial gardens were cre%ated at schools.
T|od|ay f*ruit cultivation is still the t?ask of the 55 gardening clubs in the district of Kulmbach, which include almost 7 000 members.
But by far t:hat is not the end of the sco{pe.
Gardening close to nature, bio!l!ogi!cal crop protection, village beautification and nutrition play just as important a r[ole as does communicating knowledge about healthy diets and youth wor_k.
The memb-ers of the Hutschdorf youth group "Maulwürfe" (m[o[les) showed entertainingly on sta*ge how versatile the tasks of a gardening club are.
Youth work is critically important, especially in t.he digital age, said Günter Reif, chairman of th|e district council, and the lord mayor Henr]y Schramm also emphasised ho%w important experiences in nature are for life.
Collecting chestnuts w]as for us as children a huge thing, I doubt tha$t w+ith Smartphone & Co. it is possible to collect a similar quantity of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees fo:r the anniversary with district administra:to:r Klaus Peter Söllner.
Where the trees will b~e planted will be decided by th~e district association, added district administrator Söllner a,nd emphasised the special importance o(f the gardening associations for the villages.
The district association stands for ecology, the beauty of t>he garden and g!r!een spaces in the village.
T{he fact that th#is is a real concern of the many gardening asso{ci{ations in the district, was also stated without doubt by the county m$anager and consultant Friedhelm Haun.
He pr:e:sented the numerous visitors an illustrated lecture abou=t the long history of the district association and reported among other things, how necessary self-sufficiency was after the w)ar.
In the old days everything came from the garden, for the winter c,onserves we&re made.
A-t the end of the 50s, the kitchen garden was transformed into an ornamental and live-in gard"en.
Nature endures, it existe+d before us and we must adapt ourselves to it, pleaded t;he specialist in fruit and n"ut trees.
Ther(e is an incentive therefore f_or the gardening associations not to give up, so that our country remains beautiful and worth livin^g.
Also involv,e,d i>s the welcoming o|f new citizens to our associations, explained the President of the Bavarian Association, Wolfram Vaitl.
We must stop the blatant decline i+n insects, we owe it to our children and grandchildren, Günter Reif concluded th$e successful ceremony, which was festively frame"d by the tower brass musicians of the Thurnau mus%ic association.

Priority on Nafta talks: Canada ’ s foreign minister r}es}chedules U,N speech
Mexico ’ s government want@s clarity in Nafta issues: Both tradin}g partners are set an ultimatu-m for an agreement.
Canada ’ s foreign m-inister is no|w giving t!rading agreements absolute priority - and is delaying her speech for the United Nations.
Due to the time pressure involved in the struggle for a n[ew ed|ition of the North American free trade agreement (Nafta) with the USA and Mexico, the Can;adian foreign mi~nister Chrystia Freeland has postponed her speech at the UN general debate i-n New York.
Instead of today, Saturday, the minister will not speak before t^he United Nations general assembly until Monday, shared he^r spokesperson Adam A.usten.
In the meantime she will concentrate on th!e re`negotiation of Nafta.
On Friday the Mex_ican Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo explained that Canada and the US{A had 48 hours to agree if Canada really wante~d to join t;he trade agreement that had already been made between his country and the USA.
In August the USA and Mexico agr'eed on a new version o<f the regional Nafta free trade agreement.
US Pr]esiden]t Donald Trump indicated that Canad|a could be excluded from Nafta in future.
Th}e talks concerning revision have been ongoing for over a ye!ar.
They will hav^e concluded by Sunday evening (local time) a.nd Trump ’ s government will submit the agreement to t,he US Senate before October 1.
On Friday Mexico ’ s Pres/ident-e/le/ct Andres Manuel López Obrador announced that should the negotiations fail th)en Mexico would at/temp/t achieving a bilateral agreement with Canada.

Protests against presidential candidate Bolsonar{o
Brazilian pre;sident;ial candidate Jair Bolsonaro, who was injure/d in a knife attack, has been released f_rom the hospital.
According to a report i[n the daily newspaper `.` O Globo", the far-right ex-military wanted to fly to hi{s hometown Río de Janeiro.
After his release, it is st>il>l uncle<a<r whether the 63-year-old will attend any events i~n the last week before the presidential elections.
The politician had been attacked o+n the street in early September duri$ng an election campaign in southern Brazil.
Meanwhile, in several B:razilian cities, thousands of people to=ok to the streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under the title "Ele não '-' (English: "Not him"), especi\ally women's associations protested ag\ainst the ex-military.
The associations also took to social media to prote)st against Bolsonaro's racist and misogyni@st statements.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected in th:e ec%onomi%c hub São Paulo.
I[n the capital of Brasilia, protests mixed wi<th a ral{ly of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Workers ’ Party (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the position of fo=rmer president Inácio Lula d.a Silva, who h>ad been sentenced to twelve year_s in prison due to corruption and therefore cannot stand for the presidency.
The presidential election in Brazil wil#l be on Octob_e_r 7.
As the former mayor o>f the megacity of São Pa(ulo, Haddad has so far been behind the extreme right candidate Bolsonaro according to po#lls.
The “ Tr(ump of Brazil ” has been in politics fo%r a long t^im^e, but only recently has presented himself as an anti-system candidate.
If none o!f the candidates reach absolute majority in the first ro-und, there will b_e a runoff election on October 28th.
Experts assume that Bolsonaro wi#ll not be victorious - no matter who h<e is up against.
Bolsonaro is known for being a@gainst gay and black people and for g'lor'ifying the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He shocks t[he people of Brazil with verbal derailments ove+r and over again.

Following a long i%llnes%s: Danish rock legend died
The Danish rock icon Kim Lars_en is dead.
T>he singer died on Sunday at the age of 7/2 following a lo-ng illness, shared his producer Jörn Jeppesen on Larsen ’ s website.
Larsen was surrounded on his dea<thbed by his wife and six child{ren.
Since the beginning of th-e year the musician had been under treatment for pros!tate cancer.
Larsen became famous wit<h the band Gasolin', which in the 1970s was enormously successful in Sca.n.dinavia.
Their songs were influenced by m@usic greats such as J*imi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
In 1978, after the dissolut|ion of the band, Larsen was su#ccessfu#l as a solo artist.
He sold about three milli@on records in Denmark.
His album "Midt o?m natten" from 1983 is still th.e best-selling album in Denmark.
The Danish Prime Min.ister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen on Sunday as a "street bo^y '@' who was "against everything, but in ev+e+ryone ’ s hearts."
The head of gov{ern{ment also recalled that in the year 2010 th,e monarchy opponent Larsen performed on the occasion of t]he 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe II.
A night of r?ock in the shoe f]actory: Loud as a jackhammer
Here we stand, taking the bone saw and igniting a concert even/ing with the strength of a tiger . T&he band names Here We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw and Th_e Ignition alone suggest such a description of the rocki`ng live music event on Saturday e"vening in th,e hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik, t}he community cen)ter housed in an old shoe factory: Pure hard rock brought to you by three bands who are also friends.
Af(ter the soundcheck and sho&rtly before the start of the c]onc]ert, the musicians take time for a group photo.
There is no hint of stage fright in th\e pro_ce_ss.
Afterwards, the lead singers and their bands from Ahlen and t#he surrounding a<rea - all o!f them associated with the Mosquito booking agency from Oelde - visibly enthral;l the approximately 120 visitors of the Min|t Mosquito rock night with their loud performances.
Ki)ck)ing things off, the Tiger Bonesaw quartet around frontman and guitarist Dennis Hadrika manages to win the crowd with their latest, unknown pieces, which the band penn-ed themselves for their soon to b,e relea]sed CD.
In front of the stage, people dance to the power<ful y%et harmonious band performance.
D}espite loud calls for an encore, Tiger Bonesaw then hand over th:e reigns to the three-member Here W_e Stand.
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhorn, Golo Meierhenrich on bass, and drummer Kai Hölscher demons,trate t%he variety within hard rock with their al?ternative sound, which is sometimes reminiscent of 1970s classi)c rock.
Following the high energy ro~ck of the Tigers, He$re We Stand adds a synthesizer on to^p of the guitar sound.
Among other titles, the yearning, almost ballad-like Take Me Home captivates the audience by swi:tching between melodi:c passages and the guitar-heavy rock reefs typical of the mu#lti-laye#red song,s.
Meanw"hi"le, the quartet The Ignition from Tönnishäuschen have earned a special reputation sin&c&e the band formed in 2005.
The band presented their full-energy ha)rd rock on Saturday.
It is obvious and unmistakable that The Ignition have a great deal of stage experience from thei,r p/erformances in front o.f very large audiences - recently documented in a film by Max Meis about the 201%7 China tour.
Playing off his ba\nd, Singer an\d guitarist Tim Jungmann has his very own take on the evening ’ s only cover - Wo_rd U/p by Cameo from the 80s.
Meanwhile, it f-ee-ls like the vol%ume is dialed up even higher than before as guitarist Norbert Brinkmann deliver@s a solo while running through the cheering crowd.
Of course, when it comes to hard ro:ck concerts, a certain decibel level has to be expected: According to the sound crew, tha!t level was around 98 decibels for the th'ree band concert wit:h H|ere We Stand, Tiger Bonesaw, and The Ignition during the Mint Mosquito night o&f rock.
That is approxi!m!ately the same level as a jackhammer, which i&s still sign\ific\antly lower than the peak volumes at W.acke.n Open Air festival referenced on the band website of The Ignition.
However, the Ahlen audience has no need during t-his night of rock f$or 120 decibel sound as loud as a jet engine, as is common at the heavy metal ge+t together in the n%orth of Germany.
After just under four hours, the three hard rock b{ands have long since won the audience over with the#ir confident, expert performance a%nd own songs.
In th>e end, all three bands can ho(nestly, if figuratively, say: "Here we stand, having taken the bone s}aw and ignited a concert evening with the strength o)f a tiger."
Above all, they enjoy]ed the plentiful applause f<rom the audience.

One dead i*n glider accident at Essen / Mülheim Airport
A fatal accident occurred at Mülheim / Es\sen airport.
On Sunday a glider crashed i'nto the p$arkin$g lot at Mülheim/Essen airport.
The pilot died in the acciden.t.
Close to Mülheim/Essen airport a fatal acciden[t occurred on Sund}ay.
As r}epo}rte}d by the ‘ West|de|utsche All&gemein&e Zeitung ’, a glider crashed into the parking lot at the airport.
The pilot was reportedly kill=ed.
The WAZ further reported that t$he student pilot was al}o}ne on board - the aircraft was apparently a one-seater.
According to repo,rts, the aircraft had already been on its landing approach at the time of the acciden!t.
Th%e crash site is not far from a marquee w>ithin airport premises.
However, starting this weeke.nd, an Oktoberf!est is being held.
The Mülheim / Essen airport is located on the city limits of the tw;o R]uhr cities and directly on the ramp to highway 5#2.
During la#rge events at the Essen conference center or the city ’ s Grugahalle venue, a park and ride service i#s offered from the parking l}ot.
Trum.p adores Kim: "And then we fell in love '>'
It is no secret that the U+S President is well d]is]p]osed t'owards North Korea ’ s ruler Kim, despite the nuclear crisis.
N^ow Trump has made a real de<clarat<ion of love to his colleague.
Th@is is also linked to Kim ’ s ‘ wonderful lette<r<s ’.
At the tender age of 72 years, the marri,e,d US president has a n<ew flame.
The tragic thing i#s: It is a long-d=istance relationship.
On Saturday, in total public, D@onald Trump made an unusual declaration of love to the North K"orean leader Kim Jong U`n.
Supporters in the US federal state of We*st Virginia have hear<d tender words from Trump for the descendant from the ruling dynasty of Pyongyang half his age, although the struggle for North Ko?rea ’ s nuclear disarmament is proving to b%e a p`arti`cularly tough job.
I was tough and so was he, i-t went backwards a!n!d forwards between us, reported Trump.
Then we f'el'l in love.
O}K?
No, re'ally.
A}nd not only the conversations with Kim had brought h>i>s heart to melt.
He wrote me beautiful letters, they we~re gr&eat letters.
Their personal connection also bore fruit politically: T~rump p>ointed to K+im ’ s announced to halt all nuclear and missile tests, even though critics say it is me"re cheap talk.
The U;S president seemed to be fully aware, that not everyone was fon:d of the affection f>or the notoriou-s martial threats of the "Rocket Man" - so Trump ’ s nickname for Kim.
He accepted the expected criticism during hi)s a(ppearance at a large sports hall in the ci~t~y of Wheeling: ‘ D.onald Trump says, they have fallen in love ’.
How terrible, ho<w terrible is this?
That is so unp#reside#ntial.
He cared little for t/hat, said Trump, pointing his finge#r at th%e crowd: "I always told you, it is so easy to be pr.esidential."
But 10,$000 people outside would not be surging into this packed arena, we would only have 20-0 people standing out@si@d@e.

Thanks to video fr`om Libyan prison, refugees are rescued
Nigerian refugees have used a m}obile video to point out their catastrophic conditions in Libya which has m:ade it possible for them to b}e rescued.
At the risk of their lives, t`he group had shot the video i+n their cell in the coastal town of Saw)ija in July and spread it online.
They refuse to se[nd us back, said a man in th>e video message.
We are s-uff-erin-g here . We are dying here.
The recording w]as sent to th#e website “ France 24 Observers, ” whose editors alerted the International Organization for Migr.ation (IOM).
Th]e refugees were ultima[te[ly flown out to Nigeria at the end of August.
Withou/t the video, we likely would not have been able to return to Nigeria, said Efe Ony'eka, who made th<e video, according to the news a_ge_ncy AFP.
The 25-year old was arre<sted in Libya wh~en attempting to make her way into Europe via the Mediterranean.
With t?he video, he said h-e risked his own life.
One of his companions w`as almos*t beaten to death by guards, said Onyeka.
In genera$l, the conditions in jail we,re catastrophic; “ They beat all of us with pipe%s and sticks . ”
They didn't giv~e us anything to eat . We had to drink out of the latri#ne.
The IOM organized the voluntary repat@riation of the refugees who we,re stranded in Libya.
About 2,700 migrants f_rom Nigeria have been sent back to their home in t$h$e West Afric'an country this year with the help o~f the program, said the IOM spokesperson Jorge Galindo.
Given the poor conditions i$n Libya, this case of the no-w rescued Nigerians is no exception.
However, a call f`or help via mobile phone v!ide!o was new to them.
International organizations are criticizing the conditions i(n the Libyan refugee camp,s as inhumane.
The North African country, which is la~rge~ly controlled by militias, is the main country of passage for migrants on their w(ay from Africa t)o Europe.

Laschet ur}ges Turkey to act according t\o the rule of law
Cologne - According to the Minister President of NRW Armin Laschet (CDU), d!ur!ing h(is talks with Turkish Presi-dent Recep Tayyip Erdogan, called for t\he rule of law in Turkey.
The relationships of both countries are currently ‘ overshadowed ’, L]aschet said o&n Saturday, fol~lowing a meeting with Erdogan at Cologne airport.
These concerns are r'elated to all t;he arrest waves, freedom of media and religion.
He therefore made it clear to Erdogan that "if in the future relations are going t@o beco?me normal and if economic relations are going t_o deepen, then the rule of law is a very important cond[ition."
According t%o Laschet, he also referred to t;he cases of Germans being imprisoned in Turkey.
He ha:d expressed the h?ope that freedom of expression would be respected.
Thereupon Erdogan on=ce again underlined the independence of Turkish system of jus~tice.
The conversation bet?we?en Laschet and Erdogan h&ad been t/ransferred to the building of the Executive Transport Wing of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Cologne Airport.
Originally it should have ta(ken place at Wahn castle - b"ut the c^astle owners declined due to political views against Erdogan.
After the speech Erdogan went to th&e opening of the Ditib M~osqu~e in Cologne.
Laschet declined a joint appearance in t+h+e building.
He did say though: ‘ The Musli:ms who go to this mosque, a%re also citizens of our co'untry ’.
And we are their contact per?sons - an-d not the Turkish president.
Lack of t'rust in the U~S: North Korea demands disarmament
W|hile US President, T*rump does not tire of highlighting t}he success of negotiations over North Korea ’ s denuclearization, the East Asian regime is describing relations mor/e demurely.
Foreign Minister Ri calls fo.r a concession from Washington.
No|rth Korea ’ s Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho, speaking at th`e UN General Debate, has accused the US government o:f stalling negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula through continued san|ctions.
The recent st\ands\t\ill has seen the US implementing coer(cive measures, whic$h are lethal to trust-building, said Ri in New York.
Disarmament under the]se circumstance would b+e unthinkable for North Korea.
Without any trust in the US, there is no trust in ou(r national security and under such circumstances there is no way that we ca*n disarm ourselves first, the North K_orean head diplomat sai\d.
The idea that North Korea could be ‘ brought to it.s knees ’ due t'o the sanctions, i.s ‘ a pipe dream of people who don ’ t know u_s ’.
To build trust his country has stop^ped its atom and missile tests and has destroyed a nuclear test sys|tem, Ri s>ai>d.
However, the U_SA has shown no "correspon$di$n$g reactions" to that, the minister criticised.
Last year alone, because of North Kor!ea ’ s nuclear an,d missile program, the UN S[ecurity Council passed sanctions on the internationally isolated country three times.
In recent days the US President Donald Trump and his Secretary o"f State Mike Pompeo have been p[ushing for strict adherence to the sanctions at the United Na>tions.
Concurrently, th*e US government i:s working on a rapprochement.
In June, Trump first m?et with North Korea ’ s ruler, Kim Jong U-n.
After the first sum^mit in Singapore the US President is aiming for a second summit me_etin_g with Kim.
In October, Pompeo w)ill be traveling to Pyongyang again for talks about the termination o`f the No#rth Korean nuclear weapons program.
The HoT serv-ed: New kitchen with donations from t!he community
The many visitors of the House of th(e O<pen Door (HoT) didn ’ t realise the fact that they were actually in a youth club: White blankets and f'lora'l decorations on the tables a{n{d a large buffet wer_e waiting for the guests after the Thanksgiving service.
Youth from the HoT had conjured up the buffet with delicacies from different countries i|n the new kit,chen.
The facility was financed by donations from the communi(ty, for which the youth wanted to express their thanks with t|he me#a#l.
The start w?a?s not easy, as Henriett?e Westbuer, head of the HoT, remembers.
We had alrea,dy fi$lled our refrigerators with food and ingredients before the summer break, and we were well prepa;r;ed for the big day.
But then the bad surprise came on the first day after the summer break: A p]ower outage had cut the power to the huge two-part refrigerator, the food w>as s|poiled and had t.o be thrown out.
Now we ha=d to start from the beginning again: We g:ot a lot of support from friends and neighbors, but the children and you*th wa?nted to do it alone, says Westbuer.
And so eve+ryone helped.
The resul(t was impressive and the guests were excited.
Professional chefs could not do any better either, an i:mpresse:d visitor said, while Hokkaido pumpkin soup was served a|nd the guests enjoyed quiche, meatloaf o'r cake.
It is r+ea+lly great what the children and young p(eople have p|u|t together, said pastor Frank Beckmann, while magician Stephan Lammen amazed the guests with card tricks an\d other performances.
Jürgen Sator le+a+ves the NRW executive board of the Tafel
Out of frustration over criticism from their own ranks, t(he head o#f the Essen Tafel, Jör:g Sartor, has given up his position.
Sartor had become known nationwide because t$he Essen Tafe_l had introduced a limit for foreigners.
He had resigned in Jul>y as vice-chairman o)f t{he NRW Tafel, said Sartor to the "Welt am Sonntag".
Too m=any had stabbed me in the back.
The head o$f the NRW association of the Tafel, Wolfgang Weilerswist, expressed understanding for the decision o~f his longtime deputy t_o dpa.
Sartor took t{he sharp criticism to heart.
I c]an understand his step - many people spoke up who did not even know ex%actly why the Essen Tafel d!oes that.
But Sartor i's still working for the Essener Tafel - “ si:x days a we@ek, nothing has changed about it, ” says Weilerswist.
Sartor critici=zed colleagues from other Tafel associations in "Welt am So)nntag . ".
One should not think, "that without us, people in the city w$o$uld be starvi<n<g."
It would be the government ’ s obligation to ensure that people did not star[ve to dea;th.
The man from Essen did not participate at a congr:ess o%f the Tafel in Berlin on Friday.
They ’ re oversimplifying i@t all, he said.
There are all t^hos^e do-gooders who criticized me so much back th-en.

N~ow, the team of Domenico Tedesco again showed the same streng:th, whi!ch allowed it to take the first place behind Bayern last season.
Alessan}dro Schöpf secured the lead of the home te.a.m in the eleventh m/inute after heavy preparatory head work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka, as a result of which the home team preserved the mini buffer with a s+olid defensive performance.
Thanks to an ex#traordinary comeback Borussia Dortmund are moving back up t~he national league again.
The team of Lucien Favre p"laying against Bay<er Leverkusen by half-time had brought itself to a 0:2 los,s, but in the second half came to a 4:2 win.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (6<5 .) a-nd Marco Reus (69 .) with a doublet within four minutes brought the game to a tie . Pa~co Alcacer, who was sent to the field b.y Favre in the 63rd minute a<s a substitute, provided another doublet in t}he closing stages of the ca(me (86./94 .) as the crowning conclusion of the perfor=m=ance increase after the break.
The VfB Stuttgart also received its firs;t victory.
The Stuttgarters had to tak#e fear of the Werder Bremen, which al-ready before the end of the first ha(lf-time had been reduced to a team of ten because of a ye`ll`o`w-re`d card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and the inattentive goalie Ron-Robert Ziel@er fabri:cated a strange throw-in own goal, which helpd the guests tie t`he game in the 68th minute.
Seven minutes la~ter Gonzalo Cas.tro led the VfB to its first win.
Michael Lang playing in Wolfsburg, di.d not experience a completely successful, b*ut neither a failed debut for Borussia Mönchen.gla.db.ach.
The Gladbach`ers, using the Swiss quartett li(ne-up of Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakaria and Lang gave away the lead twice, but ultimately achieved a 2:2 score, which means that since th^e year 2003 they still await an away win in th,e V*W city.
Renato Steffen w?as responsible for the 1:1 t+ie goal for Wolfsburg, which was his second goal i;n the Bundesliga.
T*h*e Aa`rgauer Yann Sommer was powerless against the low shot from 20 metres, as well a[s against the second goal against an hour later.

SPD Politician: Johannes Kahrs mar~ries his boyfriend
Almost a year after marriage came into forc*e for everyone, th:e SPD politicia{n Johannes Kahrs married his long-term boyfriend Christoph Rohde.
The two exchang%ed vows on Saturday in Hamburg.
Kahrs previously told the ‘ Bild ’ newspaper th#at a registered civil partn[ership was not for them.
If we ge't married, we want t}o do it prope\rly . He has been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kahrs speaks o*n budgetary policy for the SPD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag and is one of the Seehe;im region speakers of the conservative SPD w.ing.
Kahrs had caused quite a stir with an angry speech on J?une 30, 2017 during a parliamentary debate o|v|er allowing homosexuals to g"et married.
For exa,mple, h:e accused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having "stumbled" on the subject.
H(e felt this was its Schabowski moment, alluding to the inadvertent announcem;ent of the East German border opening by Günter Sc+habowski.
Since O*ctober 1, 2017 same-sex couples have be|en able to marry just like heterosexuals.
Previously, they had be.en able t&o register their civil partnership since 2001, but there was no equ^ality of status with marriage, for example concerning adoption laws.

A week ago, everyone still thought we we*re unbeata[ble.
Now we ar;e overtaken by reality, said Thomas Müller after the 0-2 defeat of Hert^ha BSC and asks fo-r a return l_eg in the Champions League duel with Ajax Amsterdam.
Anyone who knows us, is aware t,hat we are really angry and t"ha"t is wh@y we will crank up on Tuesday.
For the first time within more than a year of playing away there were scored no goals, as at the same t;ime two mandatory p;reseason game^s in series without a victory, the league lead@ers in the Bun%desliga lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The overall s|itua|tion is not nearly as dramatic as the fin`al phase of the failed Carlo Ancelot'ti a(t the end of September 2017, but the champions shall be aware.
The F)C Augsburg with the 1:1 ra>tio having its long runn,i,ng man-on-man tactics and the Berlin thr:ough its playful pinpricks over the outside have delivered withi$n two days two similar blueprints, as the last overpowering appearing of Bayern failed.
Those who know Bayern are aware that we w|ill not p+ut up with that and that w^e will do everything to become successful again, Kovac said.
Apart from this, he quietly bypassed his native c:ity with hi>s losers a\nd put his first defeat as Munich coach down to the inadequate handling of opportunities.
A win over Amsterd^am and B^orussi^a Monchengladbach on Saturday would make the first preliminary conclusion of his term being positive before th$e international bre?ak - otherwise the tone will probably get worse.
So before the sec{ond pr)emier class appearance in this season after the 2-0 over Benfica Lisbon, Kovac under]took no extraordinary measures.
As it was planned, after th;e day off on S@unday started quick preparation for the second preliminary round match agains%t Aj=ax, who beat AEK Athens confidently 3-0 as well.
Now they ’ v/e scored a victory over us in t^wo games, but we will also reach our goals again, annou%nced captain of the na{tional team Manuel Neuer.
Already a+fter th"e lost cup final against Eintracht Frankfurt, at the s:ame position the most notably in plain text spoke Joshua Kimmich.
T<he right defender take on the role of admonisher.
I do not believe that this is all bad luck, we need t|o work it out again, becaus+e w@e d+o not go for most of the opportunities and make mistakes, said the 23-year-old shor'tly before leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the seventh match day of the p?reviou?s season Bayern was e=ven five points behind Dortmund, which has now taken over with one point ah`ead.
And so Kimmich appreciated only with a shrug o#f it@s shoulders at leas(t positively, that now the public debate about supposedly invincible Bavaria has ended.
Y#es, that ’ s go;o;d, said the national player.
It is a good thing f|or the league.
DFB boss comes under fire: Özil-Causa: Sharp attack of Erdogan o~n Grinde;l
The Turkish president Erdoga^n condemns the exclusion of Mesut Özil and I(lkay Gündogan in Germany amidst serious accusations.
The DFB president Gri\ndel admits mi;stakes but upholds the association ’ s line.
Now will b]e created a new post.
Berlin - Recep Ta<yyip Erdogan and Reinhard Grindel fough't on different stages for interpretation in the lengthy Mesut Özil di)spute.
After the Tu@rk@ish President criticized t,he speech of the former world champion in Germany a`t the opening of large Ditib Mosque in Col_ogne, the head of DFB upheld the association ’ s line.
Early on Sunday morning, Grindl, w\ho had be~en person.ally attacked by Özil, reported on the consequences of the issue on the Ma]inz ZDF “ Sport studio ”.
As we have a l.ot of players with a migration background in the U teams, in future we mu_st draw very specific conclusions, so something like this this does not hap:pen again, said the 57-year-ol<d and plans t'o get a national player without a migration background a{s an additional integration official.
Grindel also explained again that Erdogan does not stand for the values o|f football and the D)FB.
The latter was v}ery critical of the racism against Özil and Ilkay Gündoga~n.
Our Mesut Özil, born a}nd raised in Germany, and ou-r Ilkay.
They exclude+d them from this association because the=y allowed me to be photographed with th{em in England," said Erdogan in Domstadt on Saturday.
Frankly speaking, as their president, I could not acce#pt the fact that our two yo'ung men, who had been risen t$o the Ge"rm"an national team, were excluded.
Grinde<l pointed at Gündogan's statemen{t that in contrast to Özil, af(ter the World Cup af&fair, which had been taken photos of t"he two with Erdogan, he felt that he was "reasonably treated by the DFB".
He also said he wanted to stand up f{or players in fut}ure.
That thing th|ey s;ay: If I win - I ’ m German, if I lose - I ’ m a migrant - that wil"l not work.
I am very sorry th)at he had such a_n impression, said Grindel.
I ’ ve always said that w&e had to defen@d Mesut more.
Yet he does not s}ee grounds for Özi%l to return to the national team.
As a consequence, i{n addition to the native Brazilian Cacau and C&elia Sasic of Cameroon ancestry, now should be appointed an additional integration re;pre;sentativ;e.
If somebody w-ithout a migration back/ground is an obvious influencer in society and fo,ot,ball and say%s: The issue is an important one, we need to do som*ething about it ’, th@is would also be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration needs to work ’, Grindel said.
Despite the criticism of his person after the World Cup a]nd the Özil affair, he wants to run for the post o|f DFB Presid-ent again next year.
I do m{y work and take care I do it as w%ell as possible, Grindel said.

Moorland Fire in Meppen: St>ill nearly 1#000 forces on site.
About four weeks after the outbreak of moorland fires on a Bundeswehr site in Ems.lan.d, 980 emergency forces are still bus!y with firefi}ghting operations.
The federal armed forces announced thi/s on Sunday.
70 volunteers were recently withdrawn since, according to a spokesman, th;e situation c.ontinues to be stable.
Also it was reported, that a further withdrawal of emergency forces i{s plan$ned.
On Sunday night, an above-ground fire h`ad be-en discovered and extinguished.
Last week, the state of emergency was lifted, which had been proclaimed a w,eek earlier on September 21th, because it had been feared th%at the flames would spread by wind and flyi-n-g spar'ks and t]hu]s endanger adjacent forests and settlements.
On thursday, it was reported that there is no longe*r a threat o)f the fire spreading t_o adjacent communities.
At times more than 1,500 d{eplo{ymen{t for"ces on site attempted to get the big fire under control.
The German Air Force used a transport helicopter to support t|he work on the Ge<rman Fe@de@r@al Armed Forces test site near Meppen.
Ther[e are also reconnaissance flights with the Bunde-sw-ehr's drones.
Acc*ord*ing to the German Federal Armed Forces, reconnaissance flights with “ Tornadoes ” are again planned for Octobe<r 2 an#d 5.
T#he fire was caused by test rockets, which the Airbus technicians ha{d fired off.
T*he smoke draught o*f the moorland fires went up to a hundred kilometers far, even farther than the northwest of Germany, up to Bremen a,t times.
On Monday, the German Federal Armed Forces wants t)o set up a contact ce`nter to receive damage reports.
Th,e first damage claims have already been announced by hoteliers and vac]ation home owners.
SPD Politician: Joh)anne)s Kahrs marries his boyfriend
Johannes Kah>rs (SPD, r) an&d his husband Christoph Rohde leave the main church St. Katharinen in Hambu!rg after their wedding.
Almo)s)t exactly a year afte?r marriage became available for everyone, the politician ha(s married his longtime boyfriend in Hamburg.
The two h-a-ve been together for 25 years.
Hamburg - Almost a year af*ter marriage came into force for everyone, the SPD politician Johannes Kahrs mar"ri"ed hi@s long-term boyfriend Christoph Rohde.
The two exchanged vows on Saturday in Hambu,rg.
Kahrs previously told the “ Bild ” newspaper that a registered ci?vil partnership was not f]or them.
If we get m<arried, then right.
He h:as been with his partner for 25 years.
The 55-`year-old Kahrs i`s the fis:cal policy speaker for the SPD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag and is one of the Se_eheim region speakers of the conservative SPD wing.
O{n June 30, 2017 Kahrs c?aus?ed a huge stir about the opening o]f marriage to homosexuals in the Bundestag debate.
He had accused Chancellor Angela Mer]kel (CDU) of "stumbling ';' on the subject.
He felt thi+s was i=ts Schabowski moment, alluding t*o the inadvertent announcement of the East German border opening by Günter Schabowski.
Sinc@e October 1, 2017 same-sex couples have been able to marry just like heterosexu*als.
Before this they were able to re?gister their civil partnership from 2@001, but there was no equality in terms of marriage and the r,ight to adopt.
Referendum o<ver a new state name has begun in Macedonia
I!n Macedonia the eagerly anticipated referendum for a new n?am?e for this small Balkan state, has started.
About 1.8 mill+ion voters are to decide wheth#er their state should be called North Macedonia in future.

If the citizens vote yes, they als)o give the starting s)i)gnal for their c[ountr[y's integration into the West.

Swit*zerl*and is starting an electronic register for organ donors
The re&giste&r should facilitate or<gan donations and relieve relatives in stressful situations.
Swisstransplant emphasizes that the new process will not change the way organs are only extr;acted with express co!nsent.
(dpa) Swit|zerland starts its electronic register for orga-n donation this Monday.
This shou,ld facilitate organ donations and relieve re|latives in stressful situations.
Those who want to do-nate their organs in cases of death, c{an register themselves.
Your wishes will t'hen be available to Swisstransplant, i/f required.
Swisstransplant emphasizes that the ne~w pr@ocess will not change the way organs are only extracted with express consent, as is the case in G~ermany.
It is assumed that 15 percent o?f the Swiss have donor cards, says Franz Immer, Dire[ctor of th@e Swisstransplant foundation.
But only in five percent o!f cases, a card is found at th@e crucial moment w"hen donating is possible.
In over 60 percent of conversation`s, relatives do not know the d&ead person ’ s intentions.
You then have to decide on be"h"alf of the deceased, accord/ing to thei*r wish, which is often very stressful, says Immer.
A similar registration system alread]y exists in Great Britain.
In Germany, the recording of details about possible organ donation on the health card has been considered, as stated by the speaker f.or the Fed~eral Office f~or Hea'lth Education, Marita Völker-Albert.
There is n+o register where people c=an record their wishes, for or against organ donation, she says.
Federal Health Minister has spoken about new guidelines f>or or"g"an donation.
According to hi=s suggestion, everyone will be considered an organ dono{r, unless he/she or relatives contradict this.
Amo]ng others, the Catholic Churc}h objects the proposed regulation.
14-year-old pupil is a world champion i[n mental arithmetic
The 14-year-old pupil Tomohiro Is&eda from Japan is the world champio)n in mental arithmetic.
On the weekend he defeated 39 competitors i'n Wolfsburg.
On Sunday t;he announcement was made by Martina Flamme-Jasper from t_he Sc:ience Museum Phaeno, the venue of the competition.
The 16-year-old Wenzel Grüß from Germany to+ok third place.
The youngest world champion participant was a twelve-year-+old Japanese pupil, the ol~dest a 74-year-old pensioner from France, as reported by head judge Ralf L"a"ue.
Every two years the competition is organised b/y the computer science profes&sor from Zwickau (Saxony).
Examples of previous tasks included ar]e: 14 130 214 x 1#7 981 822 or 5<7 809 355 + 28 x 16 448 333.
On Saturday afternoon there w$as a show where competitors com]peted against gu"ests with calculators among the audience as spectators are not allowed to watch the competition.
Wenzel Grüß from Lastrup demonstrated how he can keep a ball in the air whil!e calcula+ting.
H"e is one of seven Germans in the competition.
I=n total, 82 candidates from more t.h.an 20 countries, tried to qualify for the competition.
Two years a?go Grüß as a 14 year old, at the ti>me, was present in Bielefeld.
Wit<h terms like super brain, genius or prodigy, the organis+er Laue can do little with.
It i)s possible t&o train in mental arithmetic, he said.
Many participants trained several h)ours a day.
In India o;r Singapore, there ar:e even computing competitions set up in stadiums.
Squar?e root extraction from six-digit numbers, for example, is also included in th^e disciplines.
In the various calculations, the candidate<s get surprise tasks, for whic,h they need to fi?nd a solution strategy.
The main judge said the German"s also ha[d a good chance.
Otherwise, Asians a^re often at an advantage as already in early chi<l<dhood mental arithmetic is learned more intensively and with other, ef\fective methods.
Urgent appeal: Video with naked Serena Will!iams: It ’ s all ab(out early detection of breast cancer
Tennis star Serena Willi'ams sho|ws her emotional and sensitive side.
With this video the 37-year-old wants to draw attention to breast cancer and spe-ak up for its early diagn:osing.
I}t is about life and death, but also c]ourage and enlightenment.
Serena Williams sings up the song "I Touch Myself '_' o(f the group "The Divinyls" topless with only hands co=vering her most intimate parts.
The singer, Chrissy Amphlett, died bec-ause of i&t.
The emot`io`nal video is part of the ‘ I Touch Myself ’ project, about ho_w the early recognition o_f breast cancer, can save lives.
Serena Willi)ams herself could have died a year ago.
There were some complicatio-ns when she was giving bi'rth to her daughter Alexis Olympia.
To save t?he ba/by ’ s life an emergency surgery was started.
In a su^bsequent CT in Ser>e>n>a ’ s lung were discovered blood clots.

Cold polar ai+r is bringing fresh snow to the mountains in the w>e>st
Ms. Holle wi<ll b`e shaking out h|er beds for the first time in the west next we{ek: Cold polar air will reach the Vorarlberg, North Tyrol and Salzburg regions on Monday.
According to the meteorologists of t*he Central Institute for Meteorology and Geodynam*ics (ZAMG), the sno@w fall limi~t sinks to 1,500 t=o 1$,200 meters at the beginning of the week - it was reported, that in narrow valleys, there might be intense snowfalls to about 1,000 meters.
20 to 40 c!m o'f fresh snow is to be expected above 2,000 meters from the Bregenz Forest to the High Tauern mo&untain range.
Therefore, road conditions o`n higher mountain p*ass roads (Arlberg Pass, Ti%mmelsjoch, Bieler Höhe, Brenner Pass, Gerlos Pass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner High Alpine Road) ma?y be wintry.
On Monday farmers are a`l`lowed to st=art the annual hedge bank maintainance
On Monday Schleswig-Holstein farmers ca"n start wi%th the annual hedge bank maintainance.
For around 200 years, the `]` green ramparts" which are unique in Germany, ha_ve shaped the landscape of the forest-poor sta]te.
The tree and underg_rowth hedges, up t=o five meters wide, are ‘ forest replacements ’ and for many animals and plants are the last areas of retre%at.
Hedge banks connect a/s corridors scattered habitats, throu<gh w?hich the exchange of organisms can still function, as the executive director of the Nature And Biodiversity Conserv-ation Union (NABU) in Schleswig-Holstein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Hedge banks are living fe\nces
In the year 1766 the hedge ban%ks we=r=e created at the command of the Danish King Chri?stian VI who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The ‘ living fences ’ were not just field boundaries and cattle fen|cing, they also provided farm~ers with fir/ewood and beams for their half-timbered houses.
From that time comes the name "Knick": By `}` bending over" (Umknicken) the branches, the dense, intert{wine{d boundaries could dev=elo=p.
Today, around 45 000 kilomet'ers of h_edgerows stretch between the North Sea and the Bal_tic Sea, giving the image of a wooded, diversely structured landscape.
According to the NABU ’ s details they are used by approximately 7,000 animal species as a=n alte[rnative habitat.
One kilometre of h'edge bank ma-y contain up to 1 800 different species a[nd up to 30 pairs of birds may breed there.
The h{ed{ge banks can only fulfill their ecologically important role if they are maintained accordingl]y in the winter.
Otherwise, it is stunted to a sparse tree line, which cau@se@s not only losses in biodiversity bu.t al-so in the windbreaking effect, said Ludwichowski.
The hedge ban\k maintenance, according t+o the Ministry of Agriculture, can only take plac\e outside the breeding period or from October until March.
After the tsunami on Sulawesi a"n Indonesian talks abou%t local situation
The local Ra;di;ka Pinto describes the local situation on Sulawesi island following the earthquakes and tsunami i~n the interview with RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (R\ND):
Were y>ou on location when the tsunami took place?
No, I w+as i?n Jakarta on Java island at the time.
At the time of the ea$rthquakes, my wife called me, she was i?n Palu.
Wh{en I hear^d about the tsunami, I immediately returned to Sulawesi.
I arrived ther'e o]n Sunday morning, beca#use I still had to drive for more than 20 hour<s by car after the flight as the airport at Palu was closed at the time.
What is the situation on the island no]w?
The national government has opened the airport again, so a/id supply can b!e flown in.
When I arrived, I s}aw the houses on th*e coast, which were completely destroyed.
Ou+r ‘ World Vision ’ office is also destroyed, but we have set something up provisional{ly, where other people have also bee^n accommodated.
Where ar(e the people of Sulawesi living now?
Ma,ny ran to the surrounding hills, where they held out through fear of another tsuna\mi and earthquake, and where there is no access t~o water and food.
Many stopped in front of their houses with aftershocks still bei$ng exper>ienced.
As many food shops and gas stations are completely shut, some peo:ple are stealing provisions and gasoli]ne.
The public services have c*omp*let*ely shut down a,nd the national government is helping.
Even a prison w`a`s destroyed, the prisoners are running around free, and searching for them is di"fficult.
There ar*e still lots of bodies lying around, many people have not been found and a,re missing.
How i;s the communication and information flo~w on the island?
At the moment we h&av&e mobile reception, which did not wor]k previously and we have been receiving information vi^a radio.
Many people are still lo@oking for their children, neighbors and other persons, not knowin-g if they are alive and where they are staying, because people were not at home during the earthquake a`nd were on the way t=o wo-rk, for example.
The tsunami warning system did n"ot work correctly.
Do you have any information about t=his?
We do not know the reasons for this, but when the all-clear w#as gi@ven, many people thought ‘ OK, no tsunami ’, an@d th:en it came.
In other regions not affected b/y the tsunami, there was false inform`ation about a tsunami h>itting the region and they ran to the surrounding hills.
An island like Sulawesi that sits on the Pacific rim of fire, is not prepared fo!r ea$rthqua$kes?
Yet there are earthquakes every da}y, but this o}ne was the worst.
We normally know how to react to an ea-rthquak-e and are tr@ained for evacuations.
B*ut the complete infrastr\ucture has collapsed, the earthquake has affected a lot of people.
Muscle injuries to Werder: V<fB has to do without Aogo and Don]is
Anastasios Donis and Dennis Aogo w.ill be missed for a long time in the VfB Stuttgart's lin(e-up due to se|rious muscle injuries.
Aogo tore a mus|cl|e fiber in his rear left thigh during a 2:1 w,in against Werder Bremen on Saturday, the Bundesliga soccer team announced on Su?n?day.
Donis was diagnosed with a torn muscle bundl*e in the t:high.
Both pla~ye~rs are definitely not an option against Hannover 9(6 on Saturday and will probably also miss matches after the internat;ional cap break.
A downtime forecast was n]ot given by VfB Stuttgart.
A torn muscle bundl\e usually heals within s$ix to eight weeks, a torn muscle fibre usually heals a little faste\r.
Triumph of h}yperrealism at San Sebástian film festival
San Sebastián - Each year, the Film Fest:ival of S*an Seba{stián closes the season of Europe ’ s most prestigious festivals.
Despite all the talk of c,inem,a ’ s demise o-ne can summarize: 2{018 was a remarkable year for the movies.
After an impressive contest i|n Cannes, with particularly strong contributions from Europe and Asia and a festival in Venice, which attracted m:uch at>tention f(or it&s Oscar hopefuls from Hollywood, San Sebastian also delivered one of its best competitions in recent years.
On Sunday morning the Olching fire department tried to captu>re a;n injured duck.
H;owever, the operation took some time.
Even a boat was use(d.
O\lc\hing - On Sunday morning walkers along the Olchinger Se.e noticed a white, injured duck.
I%t stopped in the area of the water sa@fety station.
Passers-by called the police a{nd fire department to help the a;nimal.
Th[e first attem[pts to catch the duck went wrong however.
Despite i.ts injury, it continued to dodge t]he emergency services.
In t}he end the duck fled to the lake.
With a lifeboat, t-he fire brigade could circle t@he animal and push it back ashore, where after almost an hour it was then put in a transport box with a courageous grip b\y a fi[refighter.
The duck, with an injured breast, was then taken t!o the LMU ’ s an%im%al hospital in Oberschleißhe'i'm.
However, initial assessme\nts revealed that its cha<nces of surviving were fairly low.
Biathlete Julian Ebe>rhard aims for the World Championship medal
Biathlete Julian Eberhard was sad for a long time about fourt-h pl'ace at the Olympics.
In the comin|g winter, the Saalfelden na<tive wants to catch up on the missed medal at the world championship in Öst_ersund.
The 31 year old ’ s last shot cost him th'e medal that was within his grasp in the Olympic sp@rint a]t Pyeonchang.
Se,ven tenths of a second cost him the bron!ze in the end.
I deliberately gave myself t*ime to process this, says Eberhard a;t the opening of th~e MyGym fitness studio in his home town of Saalfelden.
My goal was t/o win a meda?l . I was in peak form, but it just wa"sn ’ t to be.
The Pinzgau region native is all the more motivated to catch up on the misse!d medal in t^he new season: "The go`al can only b+e to go to a major event to win something.
At some point you have to wi@n.
The world championship cross-country s|ki run i\n Östersund, Swe}den is Eberhard's: “ I have already taken t,he track to heart, ” he say-s as he happily remembers his fourth place world cup finish in the individual race last year.
Ri%ght after the Olympics, he celebrated Austria ’ s only individual victory in t@he last world cup winter in th@e mass start competition in Kontiolahti, Finland.
I+n Oslo (NOR), he managed secon/d place.
Brett Kavanaugh: High-spee&d FBI investigation
Time is extremely tight and the number of planned interrog@ation@s is very res%tricte%d.
Republicans in the U/S S/ena/te want the break-neck s@peed FBI investigation t?o help secure a majority for Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, which has become paper thin amid allegations of sexual misconduct.
President Donald Trump has s*et a deadline of Friday f%or investigators to clarify more than 30 years of suspected incidents from year\s back.
The recent turnaround i{n the drama surrounding Kavanaugh's nomination, which ha}s i\nvol\v\ed a culture war, had been triggered on Friday.
After an 8=-=hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first accu%ser Christine Blasey Ford, in which the lawyer dire-c-ted angry tirades at the opposition democrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee wanted to pave the way for final confirmation o;f the ultra-sensitive j\udg\e at the US Supreme Court.
The majority of Republicans seemed assured when Senator Jef_f Flake, against hi"s original announcement, suddenly declared he would agree, b(ut demanded an FBI investigation.
Following tumultuous scenes his party friends ag"reed.
President Trump, wh,o described the bitter arguments on Thursday as a ‘ scam ’, then included further attacks against the women and s&poke i[n contrast a&b&out a ‘ blessing in disguise ’.
He said that this way any lingering doubts c!ould b"e eliminated.
Later, Trump atta#ck#ed Democrats sharply a~t a rally because they oppo)sed Kavanaugh: "They try to block and destroy."
Trump is ordering an FBI investigation into the Kavana-u-gh case
The White House h{as als$o severely narrowed the powers of the investigators.
They will focus on investigating the known allegations by tw{o women, nothing more, a g?ov?ernment official t_o_ld the Wall Street Journal: "They will not be going on a fishing t%rip."
According t&o the ‘ New York Times ’ o.nly four witnesses will be heard.
As of Mon=day October 1`st the mobile radar unit installed in a "civil vehicle", that keeps watch ov;er speed limits in the borough of Ried was located to the Gart/enstraße, according to the municipality.
The Federal School Centre i^s also located there.
Th`e municipality has been operating multiple permanently ins_t_a_lle_d radar boxes.
FC Schalke 04 after defeatin~g Mainz: You co-uld feel the fear
Trainer Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first win of th=e season against M<ainz.
There is a great sense of relie(f at Sc>halke after the first win of the season.
Nevertheless, t+ime was also a factor against Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - By now, Christian Heidel is well-`known for being a huge pessimi|st at football matches.
The home game against Mainz 0.5 was no different.
I saw ever~y ball going in.
And there were m|any corners and many balls in our pen-alt-y area, said the sports director of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sigh of relie&f.
After all, the "royal blues '/' had managed to seal the narrow 1:0 win against Mainz over the course of th>e match and thus c@elebrated th+e first victory of the season.
In fact, things could hav:e been very different.
After Alessan(d(ro Schöpf (11th) ha$d given the team of head coach Domenico Tedesco the lead and therefore security, Tedesco said: "In sum, the first half was good, both in terms o;f how we played a\nd in terms of pressing". As the match continued, mental strength became increasi+ngly impo[rtant.
Schöpf is usually not an aerial thr=ea=t
The last ten minutes felt li-ke two hours to me, said Heidel: ‘ I can understand if the team wa\s only half as nervous a_s I was on t/he bench ’.
The boys w}ere afraid to sq<uander the lead and therefore kept retreating.
And threw everything th"ey had into our defense.
To ho'ld on to the first three points of t'he season.
We all felt a huge w'eigh't lifted off our shoulders, said Schöpf, whose scoring header played no insignificant part: "And I am a;ctually t>he worst header on th&e team."
But i&n the end, v;ictory is all that counts.
The relief was felt th>roughout the entire are$na, not least by Tedesco.
W`e wanted t;o start strong in the early stages and make a firewo/rk of it, said Schalke ’ s head coach.
The win was a?n important one.
Finally we can enj/oy ourselves for a few hours.
I a~m very, very hap>py for the team and the fans.
W,e played smart, calmly and with courage, that is ho%w we must approach matches over 90 minutes
T)h)e biggest shortcoming o%f the afterno\on: The "Royal Blues" missed their chance to establish control over the match early.
After all, they did get their chances, for example via th!e strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, w'ho hit the crossbar twice (59th/72nd) or Amine H!arit (62n*d).
That w<ay it would not have been such a nerve wrecking victory, said Ted@esco: `;` You really could feel the fear a little bit."
So I am gla!d that we won.
He w!as not the only one at Schalke.
Fischbachau: Smok`e column in the Leitzachtal vis}ible from 2 km

Prof. Dr>. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses integration: A discussion at ey|e level
Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafaalani i|s standing before them.
He has once aga'in accepted t:he invitation from Ernst Reiling and Lore Hauschild.
For many year, I ha]v]e made it my mission to bring interesting people t[o Greven, explains the founder and chairman of the "Rec$kenfel$der Treff" - the association that c^ooperates in orga<nizing the evening with the "Kulturpolitik" alliance.
El-Mafaalani casually starts the reading, describing the writing process of the bo(ok, talking about how difficult it was to explain t_h_e topic com.pr.ehen.sibly.
With a l!ot of gestures, tangible numbers and a joke or two, he introduces th(e audience to one o@f the most contentious topics: Migration and integration.
Why are there increasingly conflicts, despite su{ccessful integration?
The Syrian-born author uses a m<etaphor t^o answer the question.
Th"e German society si|ts at the big ta[ble, the migrants of the first generation at the kid ’ s table.
Their children grow up i&n Germany an!d want to sit at the table.
The third generation of migrants i<s born in Germany . They always sat at the big t`able and now want to hav}e a say too.
This leads t#o conflicts.
Therefore, it is not of import.ance whether one is politically rig/ht or left, but: "Am I for or against a'n op;en society?" he emphasizes.
At first rather restrained, th^en the discussion round gets mo:re and more lively.
An|d there is a need for discussion.
An Afghan refugee reports from his perspectiv,e, and two teachers explain ho_w they see successful or unsuccessful integr#ati#on among students.
El-Mafa(alani stands in front of t`he stage, not o:n it, symbolizing the discussion: It is a discussion at eye level.
The sociology professor does not force his opinion onto the aud<ience, emphasizing that he speaks of the averag$e, not of indiv$idua$l destinies.
H|e is happy that people are interested in the topic, because “ w%e can only find a solution on\c\e we understand what the prob@lem is, ” says El-Mafaalani.
Even durin$g the subsequent signing session, he still has an open ear for the guests ’ questions a{nd the discussion continued in the foyer over Kurdish spec`ialties.

Building in Landsham: 100 applicat}io}ns for 20 properties
The demand is obviously huge: Over 100 interested parti.es ha&ve applied to buy one of the properties in South Lands*ha*m.
The Pliening community sold the first properties in the South Landsham development area on th,e open mark]et.
This was re-ported by the mayor Roland Frick.
An;yway the application phase for each of the 20 properties, which th,e municipality is offering at better conditions and prices - similar to the earlier loca*l model, has no;w ended.
At least 100 ap[p[lications have been received, says Fri[c[k.
At present, the documents are being reviewed with regard t*o the application criteria, c\ompleteness and correctness.
According to the Mayor of Pliening, the goal by the end of the year is to have t<he candidat"e ranking l#ist for the 20 plots of land ready for subm/ission to the local council.
After that the awarding o#f the plots can follow.
In th[e area to th%e south of Landsham a tot'a'l of 50 single-family and semi-detached properties will be created, including four areas for apartment b{locks earmarked for eight residential units.
The development is practically completed, only the streets and pathways n&ow need t)o be asphalted.
A single plot and two for apartment buildings belong to a pri|vate individual, the rest to the municipal@ity of Plie^ning.
The municip_ality sells the bulk of the plot;s on the open market, 20 plots according to the s,ociall,y responsible model.
T_he two multi-family houses of the borough a>re to be built according to Frick as affordable housing.
With a total o:f 1]6 income-oriented flats subsidised by the Free State.
R!oom for 200 people
Roughly estimated, there will b{e space fo?r about 200 people w"ithin the properties of the developing area of Landsham-Süd.
Not only th#is: At the start of October, Frick says the new construction of a daycare center wi[ll b\egin.
This w(i(l(l accommodate three kindergarten and three toddler groups, inclu\di\ng a multipurpose room.
The opening is planne=d fo(r September 2019, the start of the next kindergarten year.
This way, Schalke player N=aldo is al,so a great athlete on the bench
Not in the s%tart%in%g lineup for the third time i&n a row: Nevertheless, Naldo thanks Schalke co:ach Domenico Tedesco.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ronaldo Apar=ecido Rodrigues has not been in the Schalke starting line-;up fo?r the third time in a row, many people would ha*ve understood it if the almost two-meters-tall Brazilian p]la]yer had got his frustration off his chest.
But when the Schalke players gathered after t?he 1-(0 win over FSV Mainz 05 in the center circle a?s usual and head coach Domenico Tedesco thanked all his players, t)he 36-year-old nicknamed Nal(do stepped in and said; "We have to thank, coach!"
That was very emotional, he is such a g$r$eat sport, Tedesco said lat^e^r about the reaction of hi#s vice-captain, who holds no grudge desp&ite his seat on the bench.
N%aldo, who was awarded be}st Sch-alke player last season, probably knows that he is actually not going to be stuck on t;he bench - he does have a good reason for this break.
A reason called “ l{oad control . ”
It was not easy to t%ell him
It was not easy to tell him that, I tell you, Tedesco said when h}e told Naldo that he was not i/n t@h@e starting lineup.
He i(s a-n important player . He is an important person.
But it ’ s always abou)t the thing, i=t ’ s about the clu.b, ” said Tedesco as he justifies the step.
Naldo play&ed 90 minutes against Bayern and Porto.
He i|s 36 years old.
It is important that everyone can catch their breath a%t t>he moment.
And that we keep every/one together, said Tedesco explaining th[e rotation, which has recently hit Naldo.
And to whi`ch the Brazilian reacted wisely: by proving himself as a mod~el team player on the bench.
Compared to th%e rest o=f the euro zone, the descending mood in Austria '+s industry continued to accelerate further in August.
Th-e purchasing managers index (PMI) was a.t a 37-month low at 46.7 points.
Across Europe, however, Austr+ia still has the third-best mood in E`urope after Ireland and the Netherlands, stated the Markit Institut,e on Monday about its survey of 3,,000 companies.
In contrast to Austria, the euro zone P,MI ros}e by 1.1 points to 45.1 points, putting t+he index below t_he growth indicating 50-counter mark for the 13th month in a row.
Only Ir"eland's industry cracked this threshold in August w-ith 50.9 points.
Bottom were the Greeks (42.1 poin>ts).
In Germany, Franc:e and Spain, the mood barometer did fall, but it fel!l more slowly than in th!e previous months.
In Spain, the index reached 44.0 points, its highest leve*l since M(arch.
However, the slightly eas:e:d downswing could mean that the wo|rst is over, said Markit economist Rob Dobson.
However, the in[dustry - at least in the thir:d quarter - remains the number one growth brake.
A quick return to t(he gr|owth zone is not in sight: Export orders to the eurozone have not fallen this much since No~vemb~e~r 2011.
That is why companies h$ave cut back jobs for t$he seventh month in a row.
Industrial production in China i~n August f~ell more strongly than initially assumed.
The mood barometer fell from 49.3 points i&n the prev&i&ous month to 47.6 points.
Experts h>ad initially expected 47.8 points.
T+he PMI figures are based on representative surveys of 3,000 European industri'al companies.
Among other things, the developments in terms of turnover, employment, warehousing a/nd pr"ices are recorded.
