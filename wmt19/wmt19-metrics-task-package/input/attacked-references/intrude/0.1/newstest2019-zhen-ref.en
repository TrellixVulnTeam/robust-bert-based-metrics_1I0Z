Accor#ding to the UK med@ia, Admiral William Moran, the depu!ty director of Naval Operations, said that even tho_ugh the US Navy was reinvigorating to cop%e with the increasingly worrying Russia on bo+th sides of t(he Atlantic, the United States would continue to take the Asia-Pacific region as the focus of its na_vy--the Pentagon had expanded the scope of Asia-Pacific region to include the Indian Ocean - Asia - the Pacific.
According to the reports from the site of "Jane's Defen`ce Weekly" on S,ep,tember 24, China and Russia were classified as the strategic c@o@mpetitors in the new national defense strategy, which was announced by th}e United Stat/e/s at the beginning of the year.
Then, the US Na"vy recommissioned t%he Second Fleet to stand up against the Russian activities more directly.
It was rep*orted t/hat these actions raised so~me doubts and concerns among its allies and analysts . They were afraid that the US Navy might go far away from the strategy of "Rebalan.cing toward Asia-Pacific '"', which marked the Obama administration.
However, A%d%miral William Moran sai;d that the focus of the U+S Navy would still focus on the West Pacific.
At the r`ound-table discussion, which was h|osted by National Bureau of Asian Research in Wash$ingt$on on January 2_4, 2018, he said: "For us, there are any significant changes. "
Moran said: "The focus remains o^n rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you want t(o describe it. "
But he admitted that the United States kept c_lose r{elations with Europe.
He s$a$id: `+` We would continue to focus on the growth of the West Coast. "
Although he pointed out that th]e overall policy about R`ussia fell within the terms of reference of the United States Secretary of Defense, he warned: "The Russians mi!gh!t face the demographi$c and e&con&omic challenges, b>ut the history demonstrates that they will become very tough if we have a conflict with them. "
Admiral Moran said that as a part o_f the comeback action to fight against Russia, China and other competitors, the US Navy was dynamically deploying the troops into a "new campaign m:ode". This would help to make the opponents unaware unprepared for the deployments of the Am(erican aircraft carrier battle group o|r other asse_ts at a/ny specified time a?nd place.
He said: "Our Navy a`nd Marine Corps support it--the concept of unpredictable battle . We should not show u$p a`t the same place again and again like clockwork .--Th,is is our approach. "
It was r^e^por^ted that the first to try this new appr&oa&ch was the "Harry Truman" aircraft carrier battle group, and its early deployment included the working visits to ports and the patrols i\n areas, whe!re it usua?lly only passed.
Moran said that the US Navy was currently trying to ensure it$s allies to know that these warships would still patrol i]n the traditional areas, and solving th'e logistical problems and family liaison problems f#or new deployment process.
Vice Admiral Michael Noonan, t{he Commander of Royal Australian Navy, also delivered a spe)ech in th+i+s event to indicate that the Australian army could seamlessly cooperate wi~th the American aircraft carrier battle group.
He said that this situation wou*ld continue as t\he Royal Australian Navy had planned to purchase another 9 frigates with the "Aegis" combat sys]te]m.

Report o*n No(v(emb(e(r 5 of China News A round-up report: the U.S. midterm election starts counting down.
On November 4, President Trump and his demo"crat"i"c opponents actively "drum up vote:s '%' on their core voters.
Both Parti,es indicated that vot{er turnout will be a key factor to influence the situation of election.
According to the report, in 48 hou|rs before the Am$eri$cans went to vote, Trump was bu;sy attending the rally for the Republican candidate, while the former President Obama just arrived in Indiana to rally for Joe Donnelly, the Democratic candidate of the Fe*der*al Sena%te, who asked for emergency help for the situation of election, and t(o shout out h"is final pre-election appeal.
On November 4, Trump went to May=comb, Georgia to rally for Brian Kemp, the state gov(ernor o/f Republicans . He sai&d, "you must go to the polls and cast a vote. "
"The con]tr]ast in this election cannot be cl>earer. "
Voters ’ political enthusiasm ha~s boosted to a rare peak and early voting of some states has been far mor?e than u_sual.
When successive American presidents fa;ce the~ir first midterm elections, their parties tend to have fewer members of congress.
Accor?ding to the new poll released by the "Washington Post" a"nd the ABC News o+n Day 4, although the Democratic situation o_f election for the House of Representatives maintains an advantage, the Republicans could benefit from an economic assessment a>nd Trump's stric:t focus on border security.

According to the oth,er p,oll made by NBC and the Wall Street Journal, the Democrats still take 7 percentage points ahead of the Rep:u:blicans.
It is reported that Obama told t{he crowds at a rally for S"enator Donnelly, `*` When people don't te|ll the truth, and words don't mean anything anymore, that's going to have evil consequences.
Democracy does not work w'hen people can only d-e-speratel-y tell lies. "
"Now, the only way to st_op the behaviors o`f these Republicans is you and your vote. "
Th*e Democrats face the toughest situation of election in the Senate f-or decades, and now t'he Republicans hold more than half (51) of seats.
However, the situation of election in the House of Representatives is relative^ly advantageous, and the Democrats need t<o win 23 seats to take control o~f 435 seats of the House of Rep/resentatives.
According to the assessment of analysts fr.om FiveThirtyEight.com, a website for predicting the situation o'f electi%on, the possibility that the Democrats win t'he House of Representatives can reach up to 85%.

People ’ s Daily Online, Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) - In the current ti>d>e of "mass en;trepreneurs;hip and innovation", more a-nd more technology companies have begun to pay attention to patent R & D and re,lated protection wor"k, an(d deeply explore the potential value of patents to occupy th}e market domination.
Similarly, man$y technology companies have encountered numerous in@fr@ingements crisis in patent technology licensing and patent technology use.
At the end of 2017, Tan Wei, He Zh%anghong an$d Lai Bin from Guangdong Province, on the grounds of patent infringement, appealed the developer of "Didi Chuxing" APP, Beijing X-iaoju Technology C-o., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Xiao%ju Technology), the operator, Didi Chuxing Technology Co(., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as Didi Chuxing), the seller, Gua#ngdon#g Pacific Internet Information Ser$v$ices Limi[te[d (hereinafter referred to as Guan>gdon>g Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the court to order that the three defendants immediately s!topped the actions of manufacturing, selling, off}er}ing for sale, an[d using the plaintiff ’ s pa=tent.
On October 3^0, 2018, China Judgment Online published th~e "First-instance Civil Ruling Pape`r of Infringement o;f Invention Patent Righ\ts between Tan Wei, He Zhanghong and Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.", which disclosed some details of case in which the Didi Chuxing APP was sued f;or patent infringement.
Th%e th,r,ee plaintiffs believe that they ar^e the patentees and inventors of the "carpooling service system and method based on mobile terminals", and the whole op#era#tion process of the "ride-sharing" application in the "Didi Chuxing" APP corresponds to the technical so[lution of the patent protection i;nvol;ved i#n the case, which formed a patent infringement.
However, during the court ’ s ruling, Xiaoju Technology believed that Guangdong Pacific was not an eligible defendant . It only pr=ovid=ed free downloads of the invo.l.ve.d APP "Didi Chuxing" on the Internet, an.d d*id not implement the patent method in.volved . There was no direct or indirect infringement behavior, and it should not b\e included as a defendant in thi/s case.
Secondly, the infringeme%nt of this case was not i"n Guangdong.
According to the law, the infringement of the patent involved should be the place whe`re t_he patent metho/d involved in the case was completely implemented . There$fore, the jurisdiction of the court was challenged and the case was requested to b;e transferred to the court of the defendant '>s domicile, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guangzhou Intellectual Property C>ourt held that the defendant Guangdo@ng Pacific provided th(e alle#ged infringement Didi Chuxing APP product on its online platform . It is not inappropriate for the plaintiff to list Guangdong Pacific as a defendant.
A%nd the defendant Guangdong P*acific ’ s domicile is located in Guangzhou, under the jurisdiction of the Gu[angzhou Intellectual Property Court.
Th]e de^fendant Xiaoju Technology advocated t_hat the case b!e transferred to the Beijing Intellectual Property Court for trial with inad)equate evidence . The Cou:rt dismissed the defendant Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. ’ s objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and ordered it assume the acceptance fee for the case.
At present, the other tria'ls of the case have not been announced, and the reporter will pa&y cl$ose attention to the follow-up details of the patent infr`ingement case of Didi Chuxing.
Exclusive Interview with C\EO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization: Au*str*alia-China Science and Technology Coop%eration Achieved Remarkable Results
"China ’ s science and technology have de:veloped rapidly in the past few decades, and Australia and China can achieve fr^uit^ful results by going forward h~and in hand in the scientific field. `&`
Larry Marshall, CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization said in an exclusive interview with a reporter from the C$hin$a News Service in Beij'ing, the cooperation between Australia and China in the field of science and technology has shown gre{at vitality from the cooperati*on in dealing with climate change to t)he `}` Eye of Heaven '#' project.
As the largest nat]ion]al research institution in the Comm(o(nwealth of Australia, CSIRO ha>s achieved many world famous innovative research res.ults in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials and astronomy.
CSIRO has maintained close cooperation wi[th scientific research institutions such as the Chinese Academy of Sc>ie>nces.
"This i's a lasting friendship that involves the trust of partners and the tradition o]f long&-term cooperation . ", Marshall said.
In May o%f this year, China ’ s Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical radio Telescope ― China ’ s E+ye of Heaven, i.nstalle.d the world ’ s first 19-beam L-b[and receiver.
This interna:tionally most advan;ced 19-beam feed source receiver is jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that the successful dev"elopment of the receiver is ba[sed on CSIRO ’ s man-y years of technical accumulation . When enabled, the FAST survey speed will increase by 5 to 6 times, me,anwh,ile more scientifi?c observation targets will be expanded.
"This is t=he contribution of CSIRO to FAST. "
In addition t~o the above cooperations, CSIRO is also working closely with Ch!i!nese scientific research institutions in the construction of Square Kilometer Arr_ay radio telescope, research and de-velopmen-t of new fuel technologies, energy conservation a%nd emission reduction.
"In the p(ast, scientific researches often focused on problems after hundreds of years, an{d now more scientific research power is needed to s>olve the problems in front o%f them. "
Marshall believed that Australia and China are complementary i_n the field of scientific development, and bo+th countries face a series of challenges in thei.r development progress.
For example, extreme we;a;ther occurs frequently in the world . Drought and floods have led to a reduction in food production and food shortages have seri,ously affect,ed hum$an development.
At the same tim:e, population explosion, aging, chronic di=sea=se and other problems are also t[he serious challenges we faced.
"The cooperation between Australia and China in re+cent years ha\s focused on solving these current problems. "
Mar>shall said that the key j`ob of Center f"or Southern Hemisphere Oceans Research, jointly established by CSIRO and National Laborator=y for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), are observing El Nino phenomenon and L<a Ni+na phenomenon, studying the relationships between th}ese two phenomenons and extreme weather, and establishing early warning facili$ties for extre+me weather . The new species of cereals developed by CSIRO and the Chinese Academy of Sciences can overcome extreme weather and can also alleviate food shortages caused by extreme weather.
"In the current environment, technologi)cal innovation is difficult to accomplish by on(esel(f, it requires extremely high costs, and there are m:any problems to be solved, so cooperation is p<articu<larly important today. "
Marshall expressed that the closer the cooperation is, the mor`e likely it is to make breakthrou]ghs . This is also the significance of Australia and China in str/engtheni/ng cooperation under the framework of the "O/ne B"elt One Road".
"Strengthening bilateral cooperation i|s main/ly for cooperation in science and technology for us. "
Marshall took the exa^mp^le that CSIRO has recently developed a gold purification method without using cyanide . B+ecause the traditional cyanide gold purification method is v*ery harmful t]o the environment, many countries hope to find a way to purify gold with l{ittl{e environmental pollution.
"We are v!ery willing to introduce this technology to China . This is one of t#he achievements of our participation i[n the "One Belt One Road" cooperation. `<`
On t"he 29th, 2018 Baoji·Silk Ro~ad Tourism Promotion and Talkfest on Projects Cooperation was held in Urumqi, Xinjiang . The guests enjoyed the development of Baoji while enjoying local cui)si)ne and feeling the local rich history an*d cu<l<t<ure.

Hui Jincai, Mayor of Baoji City, Shaanxi Province, introduced that Baoji has a long history and strong industrial base . Baoji is the second largest city in Shaanxi Pr#ovince, the sub-central city of the central Shaanx"i plain - Tia#nshui Economic Zone and the ce(ntr(al Shaanxi plain urban agglomeration, a!nd the key node ci/ty along th:e "One Belt One Road".

Ri Yong Ho, th<e foreign minister North Korea, told the United Nat`ions on Saturday that continued s>anctions were deepening the distrust of the United States on North Korea and it was impossible for North Korea to unilaterally ab[a[ndon its nuclear weapons u\nder such circumstances.
Ri Yong Ho said on the United Nations General Assembly that Nor=th Korea had taken "`ve]ry kind actions" during the last yea+r, including cessation of missile and nuclear tests, dismantling of nuclear test sites and commitment to non-proliferation of nucle<a<r weapons and technologies
`^` However, we haven ’ t seen any corresponding response from the U,nite,d States," he said.
"If the United States doesn ’ t trust on us, w=e have no confidence in our national security . It is impossib>le for us to unilaterally aband!on the nuclear w@eapons under such circumstances. "
Although Ri Yong Ho repeated the complaint_s of North Korea about the opposition of United States to "ph@ased '+' denuclearization, his speech was of great significance because it did not completely refu?se the unilateral denuclearization a=s North Korea had before.
Ri Yong H.o mentioned the joint statement between Jeong*-eun Kim an\d Trump on June 12, and at that time Jeong-eun Ki<m agreed to work towards the "denu,clearization of the Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to protect the security of North Korea.
North Korea has always been seeking to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, but the United St=a=tes said that N@ort@h Korea must firstly aband|on nuclear weapons.
The United States al\so refused to loose the requirements for the international sanc"tio"ns on North Korea.
"The Un:ited States insists on ‘ denuclearization first ’ and increases the pressure of sanctions to achieve its goals i;n a high-pressure mann\er, and even refuses to i.ssue the ‘ declaration of the en*d of the war ’," Ri Yong Ho said.
"T[he thought that sanctions c(an make us kneel and beg forgiveness is the daydream of the people who do n)'t know us.
However, the pr^oblem is that such continued sanctions are deepening ou>r distrust. "
Ri Yong Ho did no%t mention the second Trump-Kim summit plan menti/on/e/d by the US Presid|ent earlier this week at the United Nations.
On the contra+ry, h(e emphasized the three meetings between Jeong-eun Kim and M*o*on Jae-in, th"e South Korean President over the past five months and said, "If the other side of denuclearization i/s South Korea, but not North Korea, then the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula wi^ll not become so deadlocked. "
China announced that it will reduce import t`ariffs on 1,585 tax items from November 1, 20/18.
Since this yea:r, Ch=ina has taken the initiative to reduce import tariffs.
On Ma)y 1 this year, the drug wa%s ful#ly tax-deducted, and all import tariffs for all 2\8 tax ite~ms of general taxable drugs, including anticancer drugs, and alkaloid drugs with anticancer effects, and Chinese patent medicines with actual imports, were adjusted to zero.
At the same tim_e, it has also greatly reduced the production and imp}ort links value-added tax burden of anti-#cance#r drugs.
O+n July 1, tax reductions were imposed on 21]8 tax items of cars and parts.
After the tax reduction, the fin(is(hed automobile tax rate of Chin[a ’ s automobile has been lower than the average le{ve{l of developing countries, which is i*n line with t,he actual situation of China ’ s automobile industry.
This tax reduction will drive the restructuring of the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, accelerate the survival of the fittest t[o help imp?rove the quality of p]rodu]cts a?nd services . It is expected to promote t>he adjustment of automobile prices to a certain extent, so t\h\at consumers can get more benefits.
On July 1, tax reductions were imposed on 1449 ta#x items of daily c{onsu{mer goods.
T#h#e tax reduction on daily co:n:sumer goods is closely bound up with people ’ s need of better lives.
This ti}me ’ s tax r%eduction not only involves lots of items but also has strong dy_n_amics, with an average tax reduction of 56%.
The reduction of taxes on daily consumer goods dir;ectly benefits the consumers a<nd promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
November 1, tax reductions will be imposed on 158]5 industr#ial product tax items of electromechanical devices, parts and ra:w materials.
Appro|p|riately reducing the import tariffs of some d`omestic`ally industrial products with urgent needs can attract more f&ore&ign capi>ta>l, help increase domestic effective supply, assist indu\s\tria\l upgrading, and contribute to enterprises allocate resources on a global scale, redu|ce production costs, and also benefit for reducing the pressure on the domestic environment.
Relevant person in charge of Cus'toms Tariff Commissions Office of the State Council introduced that the above four ti}m}es initiative t,ax reduction and the third step tax reduction implemented o@n this year ’ s J[uly 1 in accordance with the results of th~e expansion of the info~rmat~ion technology agreement negotiation will result in the overall tariff level fell from last year ’ s 9.8% to 7.5%.
The adjusted overall tariff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower than most developing countries, a^t a moderately low level, and basi?cally matches China ’ s developing count|ry s'tatus and development stage.
According to the person in charge, as on<e of the important indicators of the d?egre?e of openness in China ’ s trade in good/s sector, the ove,r,all level of tariffs should be compatible wi\th the stage o'f China ’ s economic development and reflect the characteristics of the times.
China ’ s trade in go<od<s scale ranks first in t!h!e world, and it has already had the economic foundation to further expand its op*enness . However, there is stil'l a gap between th+e quality and efficiency of trad@e development compared with developed economies . Therefore, the overall level of tariffs should be appropriately lowered.
Tariff is a kind of protect means f|or compliance . The lev!e!l o'f tariff should be compat(ib(le with industrial competitiveness to encourage healthy competition . While overprotection goes against the industry development and quality improvement.
Tariff rate adjust?me?nt must balance production needs w~ith consumer demands.
Focus o;n reducing the commodity tax rate that ha~s a large domestic demand an{d contributes to the transformation a=nd upgrading of the industry, and striving to increase t~he import of characteristic advantage produ'cts with relatively concentrated needs of the people, continuously improving the sense of gain of enterprises a-nd the public, and meeting the upgrading needs of the industrial structure and consumption structure.
The tax reduction should ba=lance the financial revenue and the affordability of i"nd"ustr"ial development.
In the choice of specific tax-reduction commodities and range of t,ax reducti?ons, we must plan and coordinate th*e do'm'e'stic and international markets, the upstream and downstream aspects, produc(tion and consumption relationship, and maintain the steady development of China ’ s economy.
T?he principal stressed that this year is the 40_th anniversary of reform and opening up . China ’ s initiative to reduce the overall level of impo|rt tariffs is a m:a:jor measure based on China ’ s o$wn ne\eds t/o achieve high-quality de<velopment . It is conducive to the overall planning and utilization of international and foreign resources to promote the quality of domestic supply systems and meet the upgrading consumption needs of people.
This action and measure shows tfhat China will const[antl[y p|u|rs|ue an opening up strategy of mutual benefit and win-win resul~t, firmly suppo-rt economic globalization, steadfastly uphold the principle of f$ree trade rule and the multilateral trading system centered on the WTO, and continue to draw development momentum from op/ening up to the world to also allow China ’ s development to better benefi_t the world.
Serbia announced to enter the top defense readiness condition . Serbian Preside;nt and Rus~sian President will meet to dis;cuss the situation in Kosovo tomorrow.
Yugoslav news agency reported by quoting sources from the Office of Serbian President that Vucic, the Serbian President, gav_e orders th/at the Serbian armed forces entered the top defense readiness condition in consideration of the fact that Ko%sovo special troops h>ad occupi/ed the ro^adway to the accumulation lake of Gazivo\da hydropower station under the control of Belgrade in northern Kosovo.
On September 2#9, Vulin, the Defense Minister of Serbia, announced that the Serbian ar<my entered the overall def_ense readiness condition.
Vulin emphasized that Serbia would continue t`o monitor the current sit}uatio}n i"n Kosovo as long as Vucic '>s orders were still effective . Regardless of the direction in which the situation develops, the Serbian army will respond accordingly.
It was reported by the Tass news agency of Russia that Vucic said in an interview on September 29 that he had noti{fied the United S)tates, Russ"ia, Europe and other sides about the curr$ent situation, and would visit Mosc.ow o)n October 2 to meet with Putin, the President of Ru/ssia, to seek Putin's support on the Kosovo issue.
Wh&en h/e was asked whether Serbia needed to get the military support from Russia like Syria, Vucic gav/e a negative answer: "I don't wan~t a significant military conflict in our territory. "
Vucic al~so said that the Serbian army entered the overall defense readiness condition j]ust f:or the sak_e of deterrence to p+revent the conflict . However, it was a clear warning: Serbia would never tolerate any violent action in Kosovo.
The Serbian army upgraded the defense readi,ness condition in co|nnection with the two actions in Kosovo.
According to the statement of Serbia, the Albanian people wer/e carrying out the mass arrests of Serbian peo/ple, who had been living the,re for ge?nerations, in recent days, b[ut these arrested Serbian people didn't break any laws.
Vucic said that since Marko Jur_ic, the he}ad of the Ser[bian government's Office fo@r Kosovo and Metohija, was beaten and detained b+y the Albanian army in Kosovo, the Albanian people constantly escalated the issues in the region and carried out the inhuman'e arrests and deportations of the Serbian people.
Furthermore, over 100 people, includin,g the members o@f ROSU special army of the Department o;f t$he Interior of the self-declared Republic o|f Kosovo, armed police, and snipers, occupied the battle field near the accumulation l,ake of Gazivoda hydropower station, entered the ecological sport cen)ter near the dam in northern Kosovo, and blocked all roads ne"arby . These areas were originally under the control of Serbia.
Vucic indicated that Kosovo was encouraged by the western countries to make th?is military adventure . Since the Kosovo army had taken actio,ns witho{ut notifying Serbia in advance, it violat*ed the rules in Paragraph 1 in Chapter 9 of "Brussels Agree;ment", and it also breached the UN Security C>o>uncil Resolution 1244 and the military technology agreement between Serbia a_n_d Kosovo.
Vucic had spoken to S%toltenberg, the NATO Secretary-General, to criticize the western cou!ntries f.or their false words on the Kosovo issue.
The source of current conflict was still the historical gri:evances lasting for hundreds of years between Serbian people and Alban[ian people i&n Kosovo.
F\or the ownership o=f Kosovo, Serbian people and Albanian people had different opinions.
Serbia considered Kosovo as the birthplace of it[s nation and the cradle o*f culture, because Serbia had built it.s most powerful country here i-n the 12th century . However, the Albanian people settled here in large numbers only af#t#er the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbia]n army retreated to the north.
The Albanian people insisted that t"h"e Illyrian people of the primitive tribe located at Kosovo i<n t/he 4th-5th century were their ancestors . Therefore, Kosovo h<ad been the Albanian people's territory since ancient times.
The subjective political divisions contributed t.o the sharp c@onflicts between different nations, religions a|nd cultures, resulting in the fierce confrontation between Serbian peop%le and Albanian people in Kosovo.
The Albanian peo%p%le in Kosovo first declared the independence o|f Albania in 1912.
After t;he First World War, a large number o#f Albanian people, who were living in the Balkan P~enins~ula, move>d to Turkey . The proportion o)f Serbian people was relatively rising . T>he ac^ti^ons of "taking back their own l\ands" in the sight of the Serbian people were considered as the predations of the "Greater Serbian Nationalism" by Albanian people . The contradiction between the two nations intensified.
Kosovo became the "powder keg" of Balk`an.
The Albanian separatists in K:osovo libe/rat/io/n army and the Serbian army and police engaged in armed conflicts in 1999, which led to the NA-TO troops bomb-ed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia consisting of Serbia and Montenegro . Th_e Kosovo War broke out.
Kosovo unilaterally declared i!ts independence from Serbia on February 1;7, 2008.
Thereafter, t#he news came out that Serbia and Kosovo would normalize relations, and sign a global and legally binding agreement . However, due to the historical grievances between t)he two n'ations and the geopolitical constraints, the>y f)ai)led to sign t@h@e agreement, which was in the control of diff>erent forces, including the United States, Europe and Russia.
Just a month ag*o, Vucic made it clear for th'e first time t^hat he ins[isted to separate Serbian people from Albanian people in Kosovo . It exposed the conflict between the two nations again.
Power Communication Still i?n interruption . Difficulties in Rescue du_e to Strong Earthquakes with Tsunami in Indonesia.
According to figures re(lease(d by the National Disaster Mitigation Agency on the morning of the 30th, a devastating earthquake and the ca/used tsunami i_n the Donggala Regency in Central Sulawesi caused 420 peopl$e on 28th.
W-ilem Rampangilei, he>ad of the National D!isaster Mitigation Agency, s~aid that the figure is only preliminary statistics from th]e Palu in Central Sulawesi, about 80 kilometers from the epicenter . Because of the lack of large-scale search and rescue machinery, many damaged and collapsed hotels, sh+oppi+ng malls, warehouses and other densely populated buildings due to the earthquak+e have not been searched and rescued.
On September 29, 2018, in Palu, Indonesi{a, a bridge damaged by the earthquake and tsunami collapsed i*nt*o s'everal sections.
Due to the severe damage to power an>d communication facilities, the epicenter of Donggala Regency an?d the neighboring Sigi area are still “ lonely islands" th(at cannot be rea#c#hed, and the number of victims cannot be co]unted.
According to media reports he@re, Indonesia;n Vice President Kalla said the death toll may reach thousands.
Power interruption, communication interrupt!ion, road bl&oc&kage, airport damage...The re/scu/e work after strong earthquakes and tsunami is very difficult.
Due to power interruption, some hospitals an_d rescue settlements in Palu rely on fuel for po@wer generation.
The roads entering and leaving the c?ity are blocked due to landslid_es, and l~a~rge transport vehicles, including tank trucks, are unable to enter, which makes the fuel sup=ply very tight.
Indones#ian Minister of Social Affairs, Agus said tha,t due to road damage, the Ministry di>spatched emergency relief materials such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food and household goods packages from Ce@n@tral Su@lawesi and Gorontalo adjacent to the earthquake region have not arrived i?n the disaster area.
T`he disaster relief materials tr^ansport^e^d fro$m the capital Jakarta are being transported to the disaster area through the air transport aircraft.
In view of the damag,e to thecontrol tower and runways of the Palu Airport du#ring the earthquake, all commercial flights have been grounded to ensure the safety and security of the rescue . The air_port is o;nly used for the take-off and landing of mili$tary aircraft carrying relief su>ppli>es and personnel.
Wiranto, the Indon#e#sian Coordinating Ministry for Political, Legal and Security Affairs, who directed the res%cue in the earthquake z>one, demanded that th%e power supply and airport commercial flights be restored as soon as possible to ensure the op~eratin~g o\f hospitals and other relief agencies, so that more rescuers, volunteers and aids ca?n be transported to disaster areas.
On the 28t`h, several strong earthquakes occurred in Donggala R,egency in Central Sulawes}i, Indo&nesi&a continuously . The 7.7-magnitude earthquake that occurred at 17:02 local time ca`used a tsunami, which caused Palu City, Donggala Regency and Sigi area occurred major disasters.
China News Service, Beiji"ng, October 1 (reported by Yin Li)--A clou?dles?s blue sky in the day an-d th/e red clouds at evening ...... Recently, Beijing kep}t in the mode of the most beautiful blue sky . Thousands of Beijing residents couldn't help t|o change tactics to show their pictures on soci/al platforms and constantly make status updates to show the)ir happinesses . They said that "the most beautiful skyline with a blue sky and white cl_ou_ds was the best business card o:f Beijing".
Beijing had m>e>t the "bluest sky '{' since August.
It could be found anywhere in Beijing at any tim_e that ma`ny residents were holding their smart phones or DSLR cameras t)o take pictures.
O_n social platforms, such as the microblog and WeChat Moments, people could see the different beauty of the Imperial Palace, Tian An Men, the Bird's N}est, Hutong, and various buildings against th.e blu-e sky in the n(et friends' cameras.
Some n[et friends said that su?ch "landscape pictures" were the best city images of Beijing; and some n"et friends joked that if the blue sky rema=in the sa<me for a long time, the patients with cervical spondylosis would surely be cured; some n-et friends even ho)pe)d that "the blue sky would last through the winter, spring and summer, providi^ng Beijing with a blue sky across four seasons".
Why did the residents in Beijing particularly l"ike t.o show the blue sky?
That's becaus&e they had been suffering from the fog and haze in this city in the past . They looked forward to the b}lue sky eagerly . After starting the "Blue Sky Protection Campaign" i%n Beijing to continuously improve the air quality, there were less f@og and haze, but more blue skies . T=he residents were joyful t*o se`e this . And they fe{lt so happy with it.
The weather was fine in Beijing o|n National Day.
M;ost of 35 air quality monitoring stations in Beijing showed in gre:en a[t 8:00 am, indicating the "Superior First Grade".
T_h_e photography competition with th.e theme of the "bluest sky" voluntarily organized by the residents on soc_ial platforms was still under way.
Why was the sky so bl%ue in Beijing recently?
As the relevant responsible person of Beijing Environmental Protection Agency expl)aine)d, the mean concentration of fine particulate m>atter (PM2.5) w_a_s 3.5 micrograms per cubic meter in Beijin+g in August of this year, which created the best record for the same period i:n history of the recent five years.
T(he re\al-time concentration of PM2.5 was even less than 10 in September.
The major factor contributing to t"he "bluest sky" was the overall favo`rable meteorological conditions in recent days . And more importantly, Beijing had persistently carried out the air pollution control . It had vigorously promoted the Clean Air Action Plan in the past five y^ears, a:nd the environmental b}enefits were released continuously resulting in the reduction o-f total pollutant emission in the region . The<s<e laid the foundation for continuous improvement of air qualit>y.
Beijing released officially and implemented th^e "2013-2017 C>lean Air Action Plan in Beijing" in 2013.
According to this plan, th`e authority would continue to guide the alleviation of functions unrelated to i{ts status as national capital, and promoted th{e works of clean energy substitutions and pollutants discharge reductions . 4923 coal fire\d boilers were elimina[ted in total.
Thus, Beijing became t%he first big c-i-ty of achieving th:e full network of natural gasification in the Chinese mainland.
According to the data, the annual concentration of PM2.,5 in Beijing from 201=3 to 2017 cumulatively dropped by 35.6%; the number of days that the air quality reached the standards increased by 5[0; th;e number of days that achieved the S&uperior First Grade increased by 25; th,e number of days with heavy pollution reduced by 35 in total, and the occurrence r(ate of heavy pollution significantly d)ropped.
With the continuous improvement of air quality, Beijing authority issued the "Three-year Action Pl+an of Beijing to Wi,n the B\lue S.ky Protection Campaign '#' in September on the basis of the analysis o>f a new round of PM2.5 source . According to t%he current gover+nance phas:e and pollution characteristics, it focused on the important prevention and control areas including the treatment of diesel trucks, flying dusts, and volatile organic compo+unds, optimized and adjusted the transportation st<ruc<t<ure, industrial structure, energy structure and land-use structure, strengthened the inter-regional prev:ention and control, enhanced the delicacy mana/gement of city, promoted the green development in an all-round way, and strived to keep the "bluest sky" p\erma\nentl\y in Beijing . The sky wou<ld not "be precious", since it was rare . Let it return to be the background of people '@s photo album, but no"t the leading role.
During this year ’ s National Day Golden Week, t#he Municipal Touri=sm Commission, Industry and Commerce Bureau, City Urban Administrative a"nd Law Enforcement Bureau, Public Security Bureau a<nd other relevant departments will strengthen the law enforcement inspection o]f the "one-day to!u!r" market, focusing on the "six unlicensed '+' chaos in tourism, and once verified, the violations will be imposed on strict and serious punishment according to the l{aw.
Yesterday morning, the municipal government held a thematic me=et=ing on illegal `}` one-day tour" t"o deploy a special action to further crack down on illegal "on=e-=d=ay tour".
At the meeting, the focus was on the "six unlicensed" chaos that was intertwined wi+th the unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed travel agency, u_nlicensed car, tourist trap and unlice`nsed website profit chain . T"he city launched a special action for "one-day tour '`' o\n July 28th.
Since the launch of the special action, t`he city has accepted 3~9 "one-day to$ur" c~omplaints with a year on year decrease of 63% . Since the beginning of this year, the city has accepted 270 "one-day to,ur" complaints with a y/ear on year decrease of 62%.
In th@e past two months, the city has checked and det.ained 248 "unlicensed cars", investigated and handled 158 viola\tio\ns of the tourist transportatio-n bu=sines=s, shut down 29 shopping "tourist traps" and perf#orming arts venues, investigated and handled 13 "unlicensed travel agencies" and 27 "unlicensed tour guides", confiscated 26,000 pieces of illegal advertisements, torn down 31 p$iec$es of illegal "one-day tour" billboards and 3 pieces of fake bus sto>p signs, investigated an\d handled 1789 various types of travel-related violations, and 181 cases were filed b-y various functional dep$artments with a heavier fine of 4.48 million yuan and 111 travel-related illegal criminals wer"e detaine,d.
After rectification, the illegal "one-day tour" chaos has been bas`ically contained, an.d the `<` one-day tour" market order has shown a steady a+n+d good trend.
According to the information, t!he city h'as continuously strengthen the force of illegal "one-day tour rectification i'n recent years.
In 2=0=16 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism Commission accepted 1,612 complaints a<nd 897 complaints of "one-day tour", a year-on-year decrease of 7[9% and 44% respectiv.el.y . Though the crack dow.n actions are contentiously implemented, t\he illegal "one-day tours" are still recurrent, forming the intertwined profit chains among the "six unlicensed" chaos of unlicensed ticket p/rovider, unlicensed tour guide, unlicensed trave>l agency, unlicensed car, tourist trap and unlicensed web$s$ite.
Specifically, `=` unlicensed t~ic~k~et provider" is the person who attract customers on the street illegally, "unlicensed w:ebsite" is the illegal website providin[g f"ake tourism information, "unlicensed travel agency" engaged in illegal "one-day tour" o(r an institu'tio'n without business qualification of travel agencies, "unlicensed tour guide" is th|e tour guide without tourist certificate or practice illegally and employed by the "unlicensed travel agency", "unlicensed c@ar '@' is the vehicle without tourist transportation qualification used by "unlicensed t*our gui!de" or the vehicle with tourist transportation qualification used for providing passenger ser&vice t{o illegal "one-day tour", and last, the "unlicensed tour guide" will bring the tourists to the specified travel shopping store, that is `&` tourist trap".
In this special actio/n, th?e city continued t]o increase the fixed inspection and flexible inspection of illegal "one-day tour". Focus on the illegal "one-day tour" with high frequency and influential tourist route points, the relevant departments assigned daily secret investigation te#am#s to make investigations with the to*ur group's secretly, and strict investigation and treatment will be imposed accord'ing to the law, if violations a}re found.
Among them, "unlicensed car" and `.` tourist trap" hav'e beco&me the two focuses of the serious crack downs in the special action.
According to reports, without "unlicensed cars", the illegal "one-day tour '`' ca.n not b:e completed, "unlicensed ca-rs" are easy to be found, remembered and investigated, they are also fixed value with a hinger single valu&e.
Relevant departments used road traffic surveillance cameras to increase the supervision of the tourist buses along the key `(` one-day tour" rou"t"es, and u<se intelligence measures such as techno%logy prevention and physic_al prevention to find and investigate "unlicensed cars" in time.
"Touri_st trap" during traveling has b*ecome a key focus due to its small number and operation i,n locality.
In order to strengthen the shock and att'ack on ille_gal "one-day tour", all the functional departments will impose heavy and strict punishments according to law, once they h.ave verified the violation of law}s and regulations.
In August of this year, th@e ci|ty also held a seminar on legal issues rel=ated to illegal "one-day tour", and discussed means and meth^ods combining administrative punishment with conviction of imprisonment.
The Municipal Tourism Commission said that in the future, more forma=l travel agencies will be encouraged to carry out Beijing "o=n=e-day tour '&' and increase the supply of formal "one-day tour" to further occupy th;e living space of illegal "o$n$e-day tour". The specif%ic plan is still under study.
In addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission has continuously improved the electronic travel itinerary information system of the tour group to ensure tha{t each group i*s incl?uded in t<he electronic itinerary platform supervision.
From a t#ou#rist symbol to a symbol of digital e=c=on=omy, what has Wuzhen experienced in these years

After aggressive trea#tment, the survival rate of premature infants of 29 weeks and more ge"station is 98% i~n China, which has reached the level of develope~d countries.
ECNS, Shanghai, September 30 (r$eported by Chen Jing and L$uo Yanqian)--Children ']s National Medical Center and Children '%s Hospital of Fudan University disclosed on Sep;temb;er 3;0 that it had introduced the Canadian advanced method in the leading "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China".
The project result showed that afte`r aggress-i-ve treatment, the survival rate o/f premature infants of 29 weeks and m>ore gestation was 98% in China, which had reached the level of developed countries . However, the survival rate of premature infants of minimum gestation a(nd the survival ra~te of premature infants without complications st^ill needed to be improved greatly.
During the past 2{0 years, the Chinese government has been p[aying attention to the treatment of newborns.
Cu|rrently, the infant mortality rate in Shanghai ha:s dropped to 3.71‰, which is significantly l%ower than the n\at\iona\l average level and has reached the advanced level of developed countries.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China"' has significantly improved the survival quality of premature infan=ts th!rough four years of unremitting efforts.
Professor Cao Yu\n, the director of NICU of Children's Hospital of Fudan Universit#y told t*he reporter that it was of great significance for the improvement of premature in?f?ants' overa-l-l survival quality and populatio@n quality to pay attention t(o the reduction of premature infants' survival qu,ality, reduce the complic'ation rates, impr.ove the neurodevelopmental prognosis, and improve the overall outcome of baby patients while improving the survival rate o[f premature infants . It was an important problem of concern to the pediatric and neonatal departments at home and abroad, and it was also a critical issue in this project.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China" has included tens of thousands of cases of premature infants of 33 we]eks and l*ess gestation in China and has contributed t]o 1//3 reduction of th)e mortality rate of premature infants of minimum gesta?t?io?n and small birth weight through fou~r years of unremitting efforts . At th<e same time, the severe complication rate of premature infants has been significantly reduced and the survival quality of premature infants has been gr.eatly improved.
This pr/oject has established a set of complete, systematic and effective collab'orat'ive quality improvement m(eth(ods, which are suitable for our domestic conditions and will collaboratively improve the prognosis of premature infants an*d improve the level of neonatal ca_re by setting up the national collaboration network of national quality improvement, introducing the concepts o*f collaborative quality improvement, and combing 25 cooperative hospitals in Chi{na.
Childre?n's Hospital of Fudan University is con,ne,cting the forces of neonata`l departments across the country, and developing the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in the project in order to provide reference and guidance for th^e sta:ndard d?ia?gnosis and treatment of neonatal infections.
It i\s reporte}d that in t_he "Prognosis Quality Improvement Proje:c:t of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants in China", the pediatric hospitals has introduced the EPIQ methods into 25 large NICU in 19 provinces in order t~o solve the disturbing problem of neonatal infections in China NICU.
After more than 10 years of constant improvement, the survival rate of premature infants without complications i$n Ca'nada has increased by about 1/3 . Canad|a is now one o?f the countries with the best prognosis in premature infants in the worl+d.
The EPI_Q methods have been widely applied to all NICUs i&n Ca$nada, and have been adopted by 6 other countries.
According to the pediatric hospital, the research results show that after implementing the EPIQ intervent#i#on for two years, t~he infection ra(te of premature infa)nt)s will drop by 35%, and the usage rate of a?ntib?iotics will drop by 20%.
In the future, Children's Hospital of Fudan University will continue to promote an)d implement these methods in t*he whole country, aiming at comprehensively reducing the occurre&nce rates of all complications in premature infants and impr$oving the quality o!f treatment for newborns in China.
At present, it is an indisputable fact that there are differenc:es a&nd inequalities i<n the level of treatment in various regions in China.
According to Professor Cao Y`un's introduction, the pediatric hospital will play a le$ading role as a@n important construction unit of Children's National Medical Center . This project covers Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Sh{aanxi and many oth=er western provinces, with the goal of gradually pro~moting the homogenization a^nd standardization of neonatal treatment throughout the country.
It is reported that Children's Hospital of Fudan University is connecting t&he f'o'r'ces of neonatal departments across the countr[y, and developing the guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the experience accumulated in t<he project i}n order to provide reference and guidance for the s]tanda]rd diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections.
It h$as been revealed that the coordination center '}s Chinese Neonatal Network located at Children's Hospital of Fudan University will un/ite 63 hospitals across China to carry out the next stage of national qua*lity im-provem-ent i=n 2019, with the goal of promoting the homogenization of neonatal treatment in China.
Wu Jinglei, the director of Sh]a]nghai He.alth and Family Planni_n_g Commission, says that Shanghai can become a central city in Asia center . Its research, construction of the entire service system, service quality and service outcomes should have a pl)ace in Asia, in o/rd/er to truly reflect China's medical leve&l.
Xin Shiping: Build the "monument of heroes" in t}he heart - writ|ten on the fifth Memorial D"ay.
On Se@ptember 30, on the ev|e of the 69th birthday o|f the People's Republic of China, we ushered in the fifth Memo$rial Day . Xi Jinping and other Party and state leaders came to the Tian'anmen Square to attend the cer+emon+y for presenting flower baskets to the p*eople's heroes.
A>t this moment, please pay tribute to the heroes wherever y!ou are.
The Memorial Day is not on>l>y for reviving, bu)t also for awakening.
Look back the rich history, every ma#rtyr ’ s nam{e represents a fresh life.
The\y also have fiery youth, sin!cere love and caring families.
Ho^wever, for t;h;e belief that "the doctrine we believe in is the truth of the universe '#', and for the purpose to "spare the suffering of the next generation", t,hey are willing to s<acrifice everything.
`<` I would cr:y for China in each day of my life".
Through time and space, the heroes set up spiritual signposts to gui]d]e the way fo=rw=ard.
"Where do you come from and where do y+o+u go? "; "What kind of m}an you want t_o be? "; It's no*t hard to have the answers if you understand the heroes.
I~n memory of heroes, the most important th+ing is to build a "monumen.t of heroes" in the heart.
Accor'ding to the incomplete statistics, since the revolutionary wartime, arou{nd 20 mi`ll`i`on martyrs have died heroically for national independence, liberation of the people and pr#osperit#y of the country.
Due t@o various reasons, many martyrs don ’ t even leave their name`s.
Countless heroes and martyrs enri<ch ideals with blood, practice fa.ith with life . T!o remember their names and inherit their spirit, is to prot}ect the nation's root and soul.
Th+is "monument of h[eroes" cannot be stained or damaged.
For some time, the historical ni&hi&lism, abused entertainment and other un*de*rc*urrents emerge.
All sorts of actions that distort and disparage heroes and martyrs, challenge j/us/t conscience, derange v<al<ue judgments, and cause th"e public indignation and vigilance of the who_le society.
Heroes an:d martyrs cannot be desecrated, and heroes c|an not be forgotten.
We cannot let actions that touch the bottom line drift . We must dare to show our sword and uphold t_he dignity of heroes w&ith ru$le of law and jus"t"ice.
On M%ay 1, t*he law for the protection of heroes and martyrs came into force.
From the perspective of judicial practice, the v#erd#ict of some cases is to the satisfaction of the masses, which not only effectively maintains th+e glorious image of heroes in accordance with the la'w, but als+o releases the positive ener:g:y for respecting heroes and martyrs.
A nation with pursuits cannot live without he,roes, and a country wit-h ideals ca^n not live without pioneers.
It has become a com\m\on social consensus to recall the martyrs a,nd call for heroes.
Currently, t:here are millions of memorial facilities of various kinds i|n China, and more than 100 million people visit the martyrs' ceme|tery every year.
The hearts of th;e people are the strongest footstones.
Let advocating heroes, defending heroes, learning from heroes and caring heroes prevail, and l^et the spirit of he.roes merge i+n+to the nat.ional blood . The "monument o/f heroes" will stand firmly between sky and earth and deep in the hearts of the people.
Report o(f Reuters on September 28 in Brussels: The European Union took a non-confrontational sta(nce against Italy on Frida*y after Italy looked down upon EU demands and su$r$prised the market with a massive budge~t deficit plan . But if Italy stuck to a to|o bold goal, the EU might take a more radical stance.
Th'e aim of Ital)ian Eurosceptic government was tha$t the budget deficit was equivalent to 2.4% of gr*oss domestic product (GDP) in the next three years, suggesting that ther@e was no debt reduction despite deficit reduction requirements.
Moscovi]ci, the executive committee m>ember of economic affairs of t$he European Commission, said on Friday, "We are not interested in the crisis between th?e European Commission and It$aly," he responded cautiously since the proposals and san*ctions of the European Commission might have little impact on Italy.
Th<e off)i)ci)als and diplomats of the European Commission st&ill hoped that market forces would persuade Italy to adjust its bud)get plan before Italy officially submitted it to the European Commission in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, the euro fell to its lowest level in nearly two wee%ks o.n Friday, whil<e the Italian bond yields hit their highest level in three w@eek@s.
If the deficit goal remained unchanged befor=e the deadline in October, the European Commission might v_e_to the Italian draft budget, which h:as never been done t,o any country by the European Commission.
Do:mbrow:ski, the Vice-President of the Eu=ropean Commission said at a meeting in Riga, the capital of Latvia later on Friday that current Italian fiscal plan "seems to be inconsistent with the Stability and Growth Convention", which wa$s referred to t^he EU fiscal pr|o|visions.
However, he di.d not mention how this would trigger a response o~f the EU.
Bidders may submit the:ir applications for participatio,n in this open tender before October 26 this year.

Nearly 1,000 national scenic spots h\ave cut ticket prices and the decreasing amplitude o`f more than ha}lf of them is over 20%
[Abstract] A^s of September 2^8, various regions have introduced and impleme$n$ted, or issued a document t)o publish to the p/u/blic for measures of free or reduced-price opening for 981 scenic spots (74 spots for free and 907 spots for p~ric~e redu+ction). T)he prices have been reduced in the scenic spots in Yunnan Stone Forest, the Dali Three Pagodas, the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, the Lijiang R!i!ver in Guilin, Guangxi, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, Terracotta Army i&n Shaanxi, M~ou~n~t Sanqingshan in Jiangxi and Kanas in Xinjiang.
I)n order to implement the deployment o[f the decision of the Central Economic Working Conference and the Government Work Report, the National Development and Reform Commission issued the Guiding Opinions on Improving the Formation Mechanism of Ticket Price$s in State-owned Sce"nic Spots an%d Reducing Ticket Prices in Key State-owned Scenic Spots (hereinafter refe/rred to as the Guiding Opinions) on June 28, requiring to improve the formation mechanism of ticket prices in state-owned s'cen'ic spots i[n terms of reasonable definition of the composition of ticket pricin(g costs, innovative pri~ce management methods a&nd strict implementation pricing procedures, to ensure t^o achieve remarkable results for reducing the relatively high ticket prices in k,ey state-owned scenic spots by the end of September.
Various regions have actively carried out wor@k according to the deployment requirements and reduced a batch of k!ey state-owned scenic spot tic?ke?t prices.
As of September 2;8, various regions have intr=odu=ced and imple=mente=d, or issued a d(o(cum(e(nt to publish to the public for measures of free or reduced-price opening for 981 sc[enic spots (74 spots for free and 907 spots for price reduction). Among them, there are 159 5A scenic s.pots and 534 4A scenic spo!ts, with a total of 693 and accounting for 7$0$.6%.
Among 907 scenic spots which have reduced prices, the number of the attractions with t:he decreasing amplitude of more than 20% i+s 491, accounting for 54^.3% an|d the number of the attractions with the decreasing ampl>itude of mo$re than 30% is 214, accounting for 23.6%.
Yunnan, Shandong, Gua-ngxi, Shaanxi and other provinces have a relatively large number of price reduction scenic spots, of which the number of price reduction scenic spots in Yunnan is more than 100, with an overall dec}reasing amplitud^e o$f mo_re than 30%.
T+he governments of Anhui, Chongqing and other six provinces (districts o_r cities) have all reduced prices for 5}A scenic spots.
The prices have been reduced in the sce%ni%c spots with high social attention in Yunnan Stone Forest, t&he Dali Three Pagodas, the Jade Dragon Snow Mountain, the Lijiang River i"n Guilin, Guangx)i, Fujian Wuyi Mountain, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, Terracotta Army in Shaanxi, Mount Sanqingshan in Ji]angxi a/nd Kanas in Xinjiang.
The ticket price`s o\f key state-owned scenic spots a<re gradual returning to the reasonable ran.ge, which is conducive t`o promoting th~e tourism industry to accelerate the transformation and upgrading from ticket economy to industrial economy, from minority tourism to mass tourism and from scen=ic spot touris{m to all-for-one tourism, as well as conducive to forming a virtuous circle of optimization of the supply structure of tourism industry and steady e,xpansion of the demand for tourism consumption, and promoting the sustainable and healthy development of scenic spots and tour$ism industry.
The National Development and Reform Co^mmission also emphasizes th>at various regions should strengthen the regulation of price order in scenic spots, guide scenic spots to improve their services, a$nd ensure to re[duce prices without reducing quality.
Moreover, for the problems that the decreasing amplitude of ticket prices in some scenic spots is to\o sma|ll and so-called reduction but no practical reduction recently reported by t~he media, t#he National Devel-opment and Reform Commission has made a special inspection to require v=arious regions to seriously solve the problems, time-ly respond to the social concerns, and effectively implement price reductions.

National wide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange ac;t;iviti;es experts walk int`o test fields, listen to the si&tuation presentation from CAE Yu Shuxun academician team representative.
Chi{na News Service, Xinjiang, Xayar, September 30 (Geng Dandan, Wang Xiaojun) - Located in the Xayar Cou_nty o-f Xinjiang, the cotton planted in film-free cot_t_on planting t|est base has a breathtaking growth . Compared with the film cotton next to it, i+t is not infe+rior in a^ny respect . A cluster of snow-white cotton competes "blooming" and is full of branches.
From September 27 to 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities were h!eld in Xayar Co_un_ty, Xinjia[ng.
The repo/rter learned at the observation me/eting that the film.-free cotton technology system with "Chinese Cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body has initially achieved the goal of fil^m-fr^ee planting in cotton fields, reducing th=e pollution o)f the Xinjiang cotton field film residue t$o the ecological environment and raw cotton . And film-free cotton integrated technology ’ s research and demonstrati`on have achieved significant progresses.
Academician Yu Shu+xun, academician of the Chinese Academy o$f Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder and chief scientist of the national modern agricul;tural industrial technology s+yste+m ’ s cotto#n syste+m, introduced the growth of film-free cotton for Zhou Guomo, secretary of the Party Committee of Zhejiang A & F University.
"The comprehensive t[echnol[ogy of the film-free cotton developed b%y u%s can completely realize the cotton planting without the film, and can completely solve th*e problem of residual film pollution and realize green cotton planting. "
Yu Shux?un described, an a`cademician of the Chinese Academy of Engineering.
Xinjiang i:s China ’ s most important cotton-producing region . According t-o the National Bureau of Statistics, the cotto/n planting area in Xin[jiang in 2017 w`as 35 million mu, accounting for 61% of the national cotton area.
Since th@e introduction of mulching film in China in 1982, the filmed area of various types of crops in Xinjiang has re,ache,d mor,e than 50 million mu, and the annual us[e of mulching fi$lm is about 30 million tons.
Among them, cotton mulching film covera]ge rate re*ached 100%, and cotton fiel|d mulching film accounted for about 60% of Xinjiang film use.
Use film-free cotton for production measur-eme-nt, and the cotton output ca@n be fully realized from 320 kg to 350 kg pe^r mu.
With the increasing am;ount of mulching film input in Xinjiang, the residual film recovery rate i\s low, the residual film volume in the soil is gradually increased, a|nd the soil structure damages and other problem(s caused by resi&dual film seriously affects the sustainable development of agriculture.
The residual film not only causes serious pollution t&o the soil, but also has a great i.nfluence o"n the quality of cotton fiber.
Currently, more than one-third o[f the cotton fields in Xi!nj!iang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang mecha_nized harvesting area is about 14 milli;on mu.
In the process of cotton mechanized harvesting, a large amount o]f broken film on earth s.urface and the cotton p=lant are picked up . The broken film doped in the raw cot\ton is difficult to remove during the processing of raw cotton, and cannot be completely removed i\n the subsequent textile processing process, seriously affecting the quality o\f textile pro}duc}ts.
On Septem#ber 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation and dis|cus|s|ion exchange activities were h\eld in Xayar County, Xinjiang.
In order to solve the cotton mulching film pollution, simplify the cotton planting technology and improve t@he cotton field efficiency, Yu Shuxun l*ed his team to u(s(e 8 years to i/mplement the `=` Chinese Cotton 619" film-free cotton technology planting, addi.ng "advantages" to Xinjiang ’ s agricultural green development.
Yu Shuxun introduced, wi*th the new idea of innovative breeding, the^y cultivate a new line of extra early ripening, saline-alkaline tolerance, low temperature resistant, and high yield upl-and cott{on "Chinese Cotton 619".
"‘ Chinese Co}t}ton 619 ’ has a*c*hieved a series of supporting measures such as film-free seeding machinery, improved seeding d}e}pth, shallow buried in drip irrigation zone, suitable se!ed!ing densi+ty screening, and reasonable chemical regulation under the condition of film-free cultivation in southern Xinjiang. "
At p*res*ent, Aksu, Ko{rla, Al!ear and other places have established a demonstration base for film-free cotton, with a yield of 4,800 kg per hectare.
F;ilm-free cotton planting has achieved high yield, cost savings, environmental p-rot-ection and improved overall benefits.
Z^hang Donghai, an agr{onomist at the Third Division of the Agricultural Science Research Institute of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, said that through nearl?y six years of research and demonstration of film-free cotton cultivation techniques, the production o)f film-free cottonseed cotton can full\y achieve 32\0 k:g to 350 kg per mu, and may even be higher.
`{` The promotion of film-fr_e_e cotton cultivation technology has great prospects. "
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, the film.-free cotton cultivation tec<hnolo<gy c&an completely solve the problem of soil residual film p$o$llution, but there is still a certain ga"p between the current economic benefits and the cultivation of mulching film.
"The support o?f cot+ton purchasing price will be conducive to future promotion. "
Yu Shuxun said that i!n the next step, he an-d his team will continue to condu|ct in-depth research and large-scale promotion an-d application of the film-free cot:ton, making the industry of film-free cotton larger and stronger, and comple[tely solving the problem of soil pollution caused by the film.

He sai#d that it was expected that people of insight from all s_ect_ors of both countries took practical act`ions to maintain the healthy and stable development of the China-U.S. relation an"d jointly drove the China-U.S. relation to move forward in th'e right direction.
Wang Yi also emphasized again that China was certain t?o take a development road different from that of t'he tradit;i;ona;l great powers.
This road with Chinese characteristics determined that Chi!na would not or cannot repeat the mis_t_ake of a strong country becoming a hegemon, and determined that China would not become another United Sta@tes, or ch,allenge the United States, or even replace the United State>s.
Wang Yi made a speech with the topi/c of "Opportunity or challenge, partner o.r o!ppo!nent" and said that currently, the profound crux o}f the problem is that some American friends believed that China would also make a mistake of a strong country beco>mi>ng a hegemon, a(nd even challenge an*d replace the leadership of the United States in the world.
`:` This is obviously a major strategic misjudgment. "
H{e said that this self-imagined suspicion was spreading, and had amplified the existing contradictions, giving ris*e to new doubts, and making it more difficult for China and the United States to s%olve specifi"c problems and encounter m]ore resistance.
Wang Yi pointed out that the road China was walking on was a road for p>eaceful develop\ment.
Chinese people have never had a g"ene for expansion.
It was believed that a=ll countries can live in harmo'n'y, and make exchanges and mutual learning.
Regardless of past, present or future, China would never copy foreign models, or require other countries t=o co'p'y China's prac[t[ice[s.
Earlier, when Wang Yi met with Kis]singer, the former U.S=. Secretary of State, in New York, he said that China-U.S. cooperat}ion would be win<-win and the confrontation would be necessarily lose-lose.
The Chinese side was always committed to de#velop#ing the lo}n}g-term, healthy and stable China-U.S. r\elation and achieving no conflict, no confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation.
The State Council Information Office o?f the People ’ s Republic of China held a press conference on Tuesday to introduce and interpret the white p[aper o-f `\` The Facts and China ’ s Positi%on on China-US Trade Friction".
Fu Ziying, the Vice Minister o_f China's Ministry o}f Commerce, said at the conference that China was willing to strive to promote the bilateral trade to develop in a more balanced direction and hoped that the United St*ates would als#o show a positive atti?tude.
ECNS, October 1--A_ccording to foreign med/ia reports, Sulawesi, an Indonesian island, was hit by stron$g earthquake and ts%unami on September 28, and many coastal cities were heavily damaged . The latest information showed th^at the death toll had rose to 1200.
According to the reports, the tsunam,i stroke Dong,g,ala in Palu twice since it was near the epicenter of the quake . After t=he "golden 72 hours ':' for rescue, the authority thought that the d/e/ath toll would continue to rise.
On September 30, 2018 local time, the rescuers were carrying an eart?hquake survivo#r saved under the ruin]s of a restaurant in Palu, Central Sulawesi, Indonesia.
An offici]al from the disaster relief department said that the huge waves brought by tsunami were up to 6 meters high . The impacts of ea`rthquake and tsunami had exceeded p\eo\ple '#s original estimation.
It was learned that hundreds of people w=ere celebrating a fest!ival on the beach when the earthquake and tsunami struck . Many people were swept away by huge w!a!ves and die~d.
A;n official said that the tsunami was moving towards the shore at 800 miles an hour, and a lot of bui^ldings and infrastructures were de^stroyed.
He said that thousands of houses, ho=spitals, shopping malls an>d hotels collapsed, and t!he debris flow caused by t)he tsunami cut off a major highway in Palu.
In Sulawesi, a bridge across a coastal river f/ell do<wn.
On September 30, 2018 local t@i@me, Joko, th]e President o>f Indonesia, visited Palu in Central Sulawesi after the earthquake.
The Indonesian President Joko visit+ed the disaster areas on September 30, and said that the troops had been sent o$ut to assist the rescue . He also c~al~led for the victims to be patie&nt.
Joko pointed o}ut that it was very hard to carry out the re+scue activities because of insufficient heavy-duty m*achin*es and people.
He heard that many disaster areas were short of drinking w,ater, food, fuel and other materials, and many stores were closed after the earth=quake . Therefore, pla?nes were sent o[ut to airlift supplies.
He called for t^he victims to be patient, an~d asked th~em to stay in the original location to wait for rescue.
The rescuers in Palu said th$ey heard cries f-or help from a inside buried hotel, but they co#uld do nothing because they di\dn't have heavy-d@uty machines to remove the rubbles . Some rescuers had to save people with their bare hands.
Kalla, the Vice President of Indonesia, said that the electricity and communication in som\e places were c?ut off, so the information was blocked . The nu!mber of deaths in this earthquake an;d tsunami might finally rise u@p to several thousands.

"Where c<an we take a taxi?
We '`d like to go to the Golden Bauhinia Squ(are to watch the National Day flag-raising ceremony! "
I=n the morning of October 1, M[r and Mrs Song, who specially flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen a-nd transferred to the first t@rain of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Ra`il Link fo;r National Day, accepted an interview of a reporter from China News at the West Kowloon station in Hong Kong and inquired such information.
In the morn]ing of October 1, in order to celebrate t-he 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of Ch#ina, t=he Hong Kong S+A+R Government held a grand flag-raising ceremony at the Golden Bauhinia Square.
According to the statistics of the Immigration Control Point, as of September 30, the number of passengers entering Hong Kong via t.h.e West Ko'wlo'on station of the high-speed railway ha@ve exceeded 300,00+0.
At t'he very time of the 69th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic o-f China, the West Kowloon boundary checkpoint predicts a peak o!f visitors to Hong Kong o(n October 1 and 2.
T`he reporter saw at the arrival lobby around 7:00 a.m. on October 1 that man'y mainland tourists took advantage of the National Day Golden Week, to take the high-~speed r@ai@l and visit Hong Kong.
Mrs Song with light-footedness told the reporter that t:he National Day holiday was a rare l|ong holiday i%n a year . It has always been her wish to come to the Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong to watch the flag-raising ceremony . She felt very happy a+n+d excited to be able to accomplish this wi`ll on National D@ay.
But curren$tly, the flights between Ningxia and Hong Kong are inconvenient . Thanks to the opening of the high^-speed railway for the Hong Kong segme[nt . Mr Song checked the train schedule a~nd found that the first train could arri`ve at 7:03 a.m., and it was perfect timing for taking urban transportation means to the Gold`en Bauhinia Sq)uare.
H}e told the reporters, "the high-speed ra>ilw>ay is very convenient, fast and on time! "
The 7(0 dail}y one-hour short-haul trains running between Guangzhou South, Shenzhen North, Futian and West Kowloon greatl(y facilitated the residents in Guan-gdon-g-Hon-g Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area to visit Hong Kong.
After a,r,riving in Hon(g K=ong, Mr L"iu, who lived in Shenzhen, was preparing to join his Hong Kong friends at the top of a hill in Central.
Mr Liu said, "both t!he mainland and Hong Kong have holidays on Nat,ional Day . We intend to challenge ourselves and see if we can complete walking t$he 50-kil]om]eter Hong Kong Trail! "
He explained that they would not dare to make such a long t#r#ek without the convenience and sufficient time brought about b.y th%e high-speed railway.
Mrs Yang, who came from Dongguan, t>ook her 10-year-old son to come to Hong Kong to participate in the piano competition by taking the high-speed railway . She proudly told the reporter that her son had been studying pian"o for three years, an'd it w~as very mean#ingful to spend th@e National Day in this way.
She h"ad previously come to Hong Kong by bus, but it was time-consuming and laborious . Sh>e was worried a+bout affecting her son '@s condition . This time she came from Shenzhe]n by high-speed railway . The customs clearance was convenient and the time was reduced by half . She was more impressed by the trip i)n Hong Kong segment . She told the repor!ter, "it seems li[ke tak)ing the subway, which is ver'y fast . I am not able to do take photos before arriving! "
At 6:44 a.{m. on September 23, the G5711 `<` Harmony" high-speed train departed from Shenzhen North Railway Station and sped all the way . A few minutes later, the trai$n entered the Hong Kong segment of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link . This was th"e first formally operated high-^s^peed train i&n the Hong Kong segment.
The Hong Kong segment of the high-speed railway, which integrates the national 25,000-kilometer high-speed rail network and reaches 3.8 long-distance stations thr~oughou~t the country, also welcomes mainland tourist?s from different provinces f(ar apart from each other.
Mr Gao, w}ho took advantage of minor vacation to visit relative.s in Hong Kong from Changsha, told the reporter that previously, the high-speed railway could only travel t}o Shenzhen North, and he needed to take the subw)ay to pass through Hong Kong, and then take urban transportation means . It was troublesome and time-/consuming to make t{ransfers . Now, h_e c{an travel directly to the center of Kowloon a!nd have lunch which was made by his children when getting home . He fel`t very happy.
He said that the `}` on{e port and two immigration inspection" customs clearance procedure were very convenient beyond imagination, and "passing both cus[toms within 10 minutes. "
Th)e West Kowloon Station, which is close t$o the Airport Express and connects l!a!nd and air traffic, has also become the preferred destination for many transit passengers.
Mi*ss Wu, from Fujian Province, prepared to spend the Golden Week with her frien/ds traveling from Hong Kong to Philippines . Pushing her luggage out of the ga:te on time in West Kowloon, she told the reporter without hesitation, "I w*as afraid of not catching up w*ith the plane, but I did n]'t thi~nk it would be so fast and t@h@at was more than enough! "
According t+o the subsidiary arrangement of th`e trade agreement published on Monday, the new U.S. -Mexico-Canada trade agreement wil,l retain the President Trump's ability to implement the threat to impose a 25% tariff on imported cars, while essentially exempting passenger cars, pickup tru?cks and auto parts imported from Canada and Mex:ico from paying t\ariffs.
If Trump imposes a so-called "Cha;pt;er 232 '(' tariff on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Canada will have a tax-exempt quota of 2.6 million pa!sseng!er cars exported to the United States e+ach year.
Acc`ording to the subsidiary arrangement, the pickup trucks manufactured i.n both countries will be fully exempted from tariffs.
If Trump imposes auto tari_ff_s, Mexi{co wi/ll receive a tax exemption quota of $108 billion each year for auto parts, and Canada wi?ll receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
The$s$e two quotas are far higher than the current production l/evels of t"he two countries, and provide their exports with growth space.
Report of Reuters on September 28 in Washington/Mexico: Mexico said on Friday th+at after days of debat`es, the U.S. President Trump '{s government and Canada were making real efforts to resolve trade policy differences, raising hopes that the North American Free Trad_e Agreement (NAFTA) would maintain the form o"f a tripartite a;g;reement.
Despite lack of details, the obvious progress mentioned above is en.ough to prompt the Mexican and American governments t=o abruptly sto{p publishing the text of the two-party trade agree%m%ent and give Canada more time to join the agreement.
A:n:dres Manuel Lopez Obrador, the Mexican president-elect, t}old the reporters in Mexico that the U.S. government h?ad made new counter-proposals t<o the Canadian government and said h-e would continue to urge these three countries to participate in NAFTA.
Ildefonso Guajardo, the Mexican Minister of Economic Affairs, said the time for submitting the tex\t of the US-Mexico trade agreement to the legi?slation departments of M*exico an(d the United States had be"en delayed because the Canadian and American governments tried to reach an agreement "very seri(ously".
Guajardo said, "In the n=ext 4,8 hours, we will know whether we will get a t?ext of a tripar,tit,e agreement or have to publish the text of the two-party agreement. "
Guajardo said th}at the officials at t|he same level in the U.S. and Canada had "spec}ial requests" to postpone to publish the text.
The spokesman of the Office of the United States Trade Representative (UST@R) did not comment o\n the text of the bilateral trade agreement bet`ween the United States and Mexico a\nd the negotiations betw}een the United States and Canada.
Officials of the Prime Minister's Office an[d the Office of Minister f<o<r Foreign Affairs of Canada did not respond to reques~t~s for comment on the counter-proposal.
According to foreign m{ed{i{a reports, it was hard for people to find anything unusual in two little lions p:laying in a conservation c:en:ter located in the suburb in Pretoria, the capital of South Afr?ica, but they w>ere absolutely unique.
University of Pretoria announced: "They are th;e firs*t lions in the hi.s.tory, which are born by artificial insemination--the first pair of lions in th#e world. "
The scientists of the university were committing themselves to studying th$e reproductive system of female African l/ions.
Ganswindt, the director of Mammal Institute of U^niversit^y of Pretoria, said that t^hese two little lions born on August 25 were a female lion and a male lion . They wer(e pretty healthy and q*uite normal.
After the intensive tests in 1.8 months, his team finally mad)e this breakthrough.
Ganswi?n?dt said in a media interview: "We collected the sperms from a healt=hy male lion. "
Nex>t, the researchers waited f^or the hormones in the female lion t)o reach a proper level so as to conduct the artificial insemination in it.
Ganswindt said: "Fortunately, the result turn/ed o)u)t to be successful. "
He said tha't the re;searchers "tried many times, bu<t to their surprise, it didn't take much effort".
He said that the above-mentioned research breakthrough could b"e v~erified repeatedly, and the scientists hoped to use this technology to save the enda`ngered big cats.
The International Union f:or Conservation of Nature indicated tha/t t<he lion ha;d already become extinct in 26 African countries, and the total number of survival wild lions had declined sharply by 43% in the past 2;0 years with only about 20,000 wild lions left.
Th?e African lion was lis#ted as vulnerable by this organization.
Ganswindt said: "This animal will be in danger of extinction i(f we d'o nothing for them. "
He said th]at with this kind of new technology, it's no!t necessary for the lions to be fed . The sperms cou}ld be injected into the bodies of female lions, just like the approach adopting on the elephants in captivity i^n North America and Eu&rop&e.
The exports of South Korea fell the most in more than two years in September, but analysts put the blame of the decline on fewer working d$ays and s)aid that although the trade tension between China and th_e United States ros?e, the global deman>d for South Korean goods r{em{ained strong.
Ind'eed, the average daily exports of South K.orea increased last month.
Moreove?r, the initial value d=ata released earlier showed that the exports in first weeks of September during t^he long vacation had a double-digit increase.
The year-o>n>-year drop of South Korean exports in September was the largest since July 2016, wh;ich w<as more tha-n the decrease of 5.7% estimated by 11 analysts of Reuters surveys.
The ini[tial value released on Monday showed that the amount of exports in Septe/mber was $50.6 bill+ion, lower than $51.2 billion in August.
Altho~ug~h the China-US trade disputes wi$th intensifying concerns might cause other neighboring countries of China which depended on exports to suffer, Korean exports to China in Se#pt#ember increased by 7.8%, expanding for the 23rd consecutive mo:nth.
Since the sales of oil products declined, Korea{n exports to Americ_a decreased by 11.8%.
Alth)o)ugh the market worried that th&e so-called "supercycle" of chips might reach the peak, the overseas sales of Korean mem^ory chips and oil produc`ts increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively.
"However, t?he influence of trade conflicts c-an not be avoided, because Korean exports con}siderably depend on American and Chinese markets. "
The imports decreased by 2.1% t&o $40.8 billion, inferior to th'e increase of 3.1% estimated by th\e Reuters survey.
The init{ial value o#f trade surplu^s in September was $9.7 billion, higher than $6.9 billion in August.
The Department o)f Industry said that thanks to America and the EU countries, the g!lobal manufacturing wo{u{ld maintain buoyant, which was a favorable factor for Korean exports.
The statement pointed out, `+` the increasing export price caused by the rise of t/he o=il price will be beneficial to the exports in t?he second half of this year. "
"However, the trade conflict between the United States and China continues and the market fluctuation after rising U.S. interest rates intensifi'es, which are both negativ+e pre_ssure on exports. `.`
The a-verage exports o|f each working day in Septembe}r increased to $2.6 billion, while the amount in August was $2.1 billion.
The Mid-Autum%n Festival in South Korea this year was from September 24-26 so t^ha^t there were onl-y 19.5 working days i}n September, four days less than the same period last year.
The Korean exp_orts from January to September increased by 4".7% compared with that of the same per#iod last year.
Accor!d!in!g to the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers Index, activities of Korean manufacturing rose again i{n September which was supported by domestic orders, since Chinese and Japanese orders declined, which would probabl_y cast a shadow over export pros;pe;cts.
North Korean me}dia criticized the United States for not easing t]he sanctions on North Korea.
North Korea's "Rod*on*g Shinmun" published a signatured rev_iew article on September 30 to criticize t(h(e United States for not easing the sanctions o?n North Korea while seeking to have a dialogue with North Korea . The article said that it was a `@` self-contradictory" action.
The article said that Pompeo, t*he United States Secretary of State, indicated on September 14 that "the key to achieve the denuclearization o?f the Korean Peninsula was t@o impose the sanctions on North Korea" to emphasize that the United St:ates would keep its position on implementing the U`N resolution to i)mpose sanctions.
I[n the North Korea-US Joint Statement of Singapore, t[he two s]ides promised to build a new North Korea-US relation, which complied wi;t;h the two peoples' wishes of looking forward to peace and prosperity.
On one side, the United States increased th?e intensity of sanctions, b+ut on th~e other side, it asked for the dialogue . Undoubt"edly, its actions were self-contradictory.
According to t!h!e article, if i^t wanted to bui:ld a n!ew North Korea-US relation, establish a permanently consolidated system of peace in the Ko+rean Peninsula, and achieve the denuclearizat:ion of the Korean Peninsula, it would put building trust in the fi_rst place, start from what can be done, and solve the problems by stages.
Th_e article also said th<at the United States s,hould understand that it wouldn't work to impose sanctions on North Korea.
The article said that even the "Severodvinsk" pr/eceded the "Kazan '/' was admired b\y the U.S. military.
The National Interest quotes the view of US Navy a:s saying, "we wi&ll encounter a strong p`otential opponent . It is enough to see t|he "Severodvinsk" submarine only. "
Foggo, the current commander in chi{ef of t"he U.S. navy in Europe, also high)ly praised the "Severodvinsk" submarine.
He said, "this submarine is impressive . Look at the development of Russian navy and how they utilize resour]ces and i\t will be known that their main efforts on th\e fields of research and devel!o!pment are firstly to strenghten the s^ubmarine fleet. "
However, the National Interest still considers the United States maintains th'e advantage against Russia in th(is field.
Foggo said, "I believ'e that western c!ountries still have asymmetrical advantages. "
Previously, it was informed that the Russian navy woul"d equip the "Kazan" subm|a|rine in 2019.
The multipurpose submarines of `~` Kazan", "Novosibirsk", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arkhangelsk" are all of "Fraxinus-M '_' improved type, with disp?lace?ment of 13,8@0@0 tons, depth of 52/0 m, staffing of 64, submerged speed of 31 knots . All the submarines wil:l carry mines, torpedoes and "Kalibr '<' and "Onyx" cruise missiles.

Ignore the Threat o'f America!
EU may Reach Crude Oil Purchase Agr#eement with Iran
The US government announced that it will rest^art a new roun}d of sanctions against Iran in November and even urge other countries to red_uce imports of Iran oil.
However, the American allies d-id not s&eem to take the advice.
According to the US "New York Times", o]n 29t+h, during the interview, Zarif, Foreign Minister of Iran, revealed that although the United States threatened to sancti$o$n any country tha?t does business with Iran, Tehran is approaching to reach an agreement on the s+ale of crude oil w(ith EU.
The core purpose of t+his agreement is to tr>y to establish a new paym=ent mechanism, which is to replace the dollar transaction in the form o]f barter or domestic currency.
Th,e purpose of this approach is to bypass the United States a?nd pr[event the United States from impeding financial transfers.
Meanwhile, altho)ugh the EU i_s working on facilitating the agreement, s/ome French a,nd British officials are also worried that if the agreement i\s concluded, it will be the most overt confrontation between the EU and the United States again}st the US withdrawal from the Iran nuclear deal.
The US media said that in the o?ne hour interview, Zarif ’ s w(ords sounded more opti(mistic than in recent months.
B.ecause the agreement can "strip" the traditional American allies and effectively br'eak the US ’ s attempts to cut I<r<a<n ’ s income.
"This can guarantee that w#e can sell oil and obtain benefits", Zarif be.lieved . According to the agreement reached in 2015, each country has the legal rights t|o make trade contact@s with Iran.
The head of Union for Foreign Affairs Policy, Federica Mogherini, also sai)d recently that `|` no sovereign state or or;ganization can accept other people t|o decide who they can trade with. "
However, she also predicted that before the US government carri_ed out the next step of sanctions in November, US le|aders could adopt a series of financial instruments aimed at ba`n`ks, businessmen an!d countries th/at have commercial intercourses with Tehran.
In May of thi"s year, the U+S government unilaterally announced its withdrawal from the Iran nucle@ar deal on the grounds th^at the agreement had deficiencies, saying th\at the agreement could not permanently prohibit Iran from producing nuclear fuel.
The US then threatened to ban companies that buy Iran o$il a>nd o!the!r commodities from doing business in the United States.
This threat forced some companies to lea[ve Tehran and made the Iran/ian currency dropped sharply.
Compani\es such as Airbus S.A.S . and French oil giant Total have can,celled billions o?f dollars in investment in Iran.
British an"d French officials sa<id, the US government may "take the lead".
Unsurprisingly, according to a recen~t report by the Turkish media, the US san)ctions did not seem to have a maj-or impact on Iran ’ s oil exports.
Recently, Iran Oil Minister Zanganeh disclo>sed that no country other than South Korea has stopped b[uy[ing Iran oil.
Both Zarif and Iran Presiden\t Rouhani believed that the purpose of a series of US a'ctions is to "seduce" Iran ’ s bre)ach of the agreement.
Zarif also regarded the US serial bl-ast a%s not worthy of consideration . When asked if the US would overthrow the curr>ent Iranian gove{rn{m{ent with inc=reasing financial pressure, Zar*if even laughed . "It is a regime change strategy, and this is the true purpose of the US. "

In order to further encourage foreign investors to inve=st i_n China, the China's Ministry of Finance and other three ministries and commissions jointly notify that from January 1, 2018, for the profits allocated for foreign investors from the enterprises h`el`d by Chinese residents, if such pro/fits are within t=he scope o,f application for the policy of usage of domes|tic direct i<nvestments without withholding income tax, the foreign investment incentive projects wi:ll be expanded to all non-prohibited foreign investment projects and fields.
Relevant notices published on the website of the M)i)nistry of Finance said that the temporary no@n-imposition of withholding income tax from foreign investors should meet several conditions at the same time, including direct investment of for@eign investors with profit-sharing, and equity investments o-f forei*gn investors, such as capita]l increase, greenfield investment a!nd equity acquisition with profit-sharing, but excluding new, turning point increase and acquisition o\f shares of listed companies (except for eligib"le strategic investments).
It al!so included the part that t}he profits allocated to the overseas investors belonged to the ear>ning>s from equity investments of d|ividen|ds and bonus generated by the retained earnings which had been achieved for what wa?s actually allocated to the investors by the enterprises held by Chinese residents.
For the profits used by the overseas investors for direct investment and paid in ca^sh, the relevant payment would be di%rect%ly transfer+red from the account of the profit allocation enterprise to the account of the invested enterprise o=r equity transferor . A turnover i^n otfher domestic and foreign accounts should not be made before direct investment; fo]r the profits used by the overseas investors for direct investment and paid in non-cash f}or}m of physical objects and negot^iable securities, the owner:ship o^f rele*vant assets would be directly transferred from t)he profit distribution enterprise to t.h.e invested enterprise or equity transferor . It should not be held on behalf or temporarily by other enterprises or individuals before direct investment.
The notification also said that the overseas investors actu%al%ly recovered the direct investment which enjoyed the policy treatment of t)emporary exemption from withholding income tax via equ\ity transfer, repurchase and liquidation . The deferred t{ax should be reported and paid to the ta]x department according to stipulated procedures within 7 days after actually collecting releva%n%t payments.
To encourage oversea=s investors to continue to invest and operate businesses in China, Ch}ina's Mini.stry of Finance, Mini\stry of Commerce and other two ministries and commissions jointly released notices at the end of 2017 . Since January 1, 2017, for the profits allocated to overseas investors from the enterp}ris}es held by Chinese residents and directly invested to the encouraged invest"m"ent projects, which met stipulated conditions, a deferred taxat`ion policy was implemented and the withholding income t)a)x wou{ld temporarily be exempted.

The reporter learned from the National Healt`h Commission that the prevalence of malnutrition in our childre>n and adolescents had reduced but the prevalence of overweight-obesity had significantly increa:sed comparing to decades ag>o.
The expert po[inted out that th:e most important concept to maint#ain a healthy weight was the "preventive treatment of disease". The scientific fitness and rational diet s.hould be vigorously promoted.
According to the "Core Information on Health Education o^f Chi+nese Ad;olesc;ents and Interpretation (2018 version)" released b'y the National Health Commission recently, the key to maintain a healthy weight was the rational d[iet and scientific movement.
The overweight, obesity and blind weight reduction w:er:e harmful to h@ealth.
The health hazard behind the `?` c)hubby children" couldn't be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, the head of National Institute for Nutritio+n and Health of Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said that overweight-obesity could harm the adolescents' normal growth and deve@lo@pmen@t, have a n&egativ&e impact on their ment;ality, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even cause hypertension, hyperglycemia and h~yperl~ipidem~i~a in chi+ldre+n.
And the adolescent/s' overweight-obesity mi@gh@t continue into adulthood, which would increase the adolesce-nts' risk of having ch@ronic diseases, such as hypertension and diabetes in their adulthood.
Ding Gangqiang said that the overweight rate was 9.6% and the obesity rate was 6.4% among Chinese children and adolescents of 6-17 years ol=d according to the Nutrition and Healt.h Status Inspection of C"hinese Residents in 2010-2012 . The sum o)f these two rates wa,s 16%.
Meanwhile, the characteristics of overwe:igh:t-obesity among children and adolescents were th_at the overweight-obesity rate was higher in boys th~an in girls, and it was high_er in cities than in vil?l?ages . The overweight-obesity rate had significantly increased in recent decades.
How would the adolescents d@ea@l with the overweight-obesity?
Zhang Li, t&he deputy director of Science Fitness and Health Promot(ion Research Center of General Administration of Sport of C%hina, indicated that the primary cause`s of adolescent obesit!y at present were excessive caloric intake and inadequate physical activity.
For this kind o]f simple obesity, w%e should lay emphasis on scientific movement and reasonable diet control.
Zhang Li pointed out that the mo`st important con+cep+t to maintain a healthy weight was the "preventive treatment of disease", a?n?d an integral part of it was t<o conduct the all-round science popularization education of schools, parents and students, popular{ize the dangers of overweight and obesity, and increase the adole,scents' self-protection awareness.
The adolescents should take the periodic physical examination t-o monitor the grow,th and development index, such as height and weight, so that t-he problems of overweight and obesity could be discovered early and determined scien.tifical.ly t^o take intervention measures in time.
For those adolescents who are already overweight a"nd obese, Ding Gangqiang advised that starvation th/erapy or semi-starvation therapy should be avoided to control and l(ose weight in additio{n to the active an\d scientific arrangement of di@et and movement since the adolescents are in a special physiological stage . They should not take drugs blindly to lose weight.

China News Service, Yichang, October 1 (reported b|y Guo Xiaoying and Liu Min)--The newly revised "Thr]ee Gorges-Gezhouba Hydro Project Navigation Scheduling Regulation '+' (hereinafter referred t_o as "Schedu]ling Regulation") was officially enforced starting from October 1 . After two years of navigation test, t/he Three G.orges ship lift was officially scheduled together with t(he navigation lock in a unified way.
On th,e first day of enforcing the new regulations, t|he navigation in Thr&e&e Gorges-Gezhouba waters was in good order.
Three Gorges Navigation Authority released the first plan o"f security check at 21:00 on September 30, an/d carried out t(he security check on 160 ships, with 124 ships passing the sec>u>rity check.
The navigation authority arranged the first loc*king pla`n after the enfor.cement of new regulations at 14:00 on October, 1.
After the enforcement of new regul!at!ions, the plan of security ch`eck wou>ld be released once every day at 9:00 an%d 21:00, and the plan of passing dam would be released once every day a^t 14:00 and 20:00, so that the s!hi!ps could flexibly arrange the plan of passing dam.
The "Classification Control" sche@duling principle of ship passing dam was added in the "Scheduling Regulation". The priority of ship passing dam would be determined according t/o the functional localization of navigation lock and shi:p l=ift respectively . The short-term passenger ship p{assing dam would be adjusted to b`e in the same priority as the demonstration s^hi^p and integrity ship.
T?his is also the official scheduling of ship lift and navigation lock af~t~er the two-year navigation test of sh}ip lift.
It was also the f;ir;st time for big length-width demonstration ship and new energy driven ship of Chuanjiang R(ive(r an]d Three Gorges Reservoir Region t{o be ranked in the priority.
At th#e same time, the "navigation scheduling management waters" were adjusted from the 180-kilometer waters close to dam to the 541.8-kilometer waters from Yunyang Yangtze River Bridg$e t?o Shish,ou Yangtze River Bridge in the "Scheduling Regul!atio!n". And the "core waters", "water c{lose to dam", "control waters '-' and "scheduling waters" were divided.
This acti^on would help the ship choose th)e proper waters to wait for crossing the lock, avoidi)ng excessive ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region.
The "Scheduling Regulation" also put forward th]e measures of integrity constraint for the rule-breaking ships according to the current characteristics of ship passing d|a|m and waiting for crossing lock, su"ch a~s canceling th#e declaration and delaying the time of passing dam for 24 hours.
After water storing of the Three Gorges, the navigation condition o@f the reservoir area was improved, acc$elerating th,e rapid development of shipping in Yangtze River.
According to data, the annual cargo throughput of Three Gorges ship lock and Gezhouba ship lock was increased fro[m 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 0.138 billion t|ons and 0.14 bi/lli/o/n tons i'n 2017 respectively.
During the two-year navigation test of ship lift, 5767 ships and 0.1622 mi+llio+n people have passed, and the volume of go/ods tr&ansp&orted was 1.7128 million tons.
Chen Dongyuan, the deputy director of Three Gorges Navigation Authority, said that the "Scheduling Regulation" played an active role in promotin"g th)e management of crossing lock in an honest way, relieving th<e pressure of ships w:aiting for crossing t)h)e lock in the dam region, a'nd improving the navigation capacity.

Signed and approved by Premier Li Keq>iang, the State Council printed and distributed the "Decision of the State Council on Further Reducing the Categories in the Catalogue o[f Industrial Products Subject to Production License Adm-in-istr-ation and Simplifying t=he Approval Proc@e@dures".
The "Decision" proposed to further reduce the categories in the catalogue of industrial pro"ducts subject to pr%odu%ction license administration, cancel the production license administration for 14 industrial products, and delegate the admini<stratio<n authority for production li)cens)es of 4 type+s of industrial products to t!he quality and technical supervision departments of provincial people ’ s governments.
After this reform, the products that implement the industrial p\roduct production lice`nses administration will be reduced from las}t year ’ s 38 categories to the current 24 categories.
The "Decisi.on" clea+rly simplifies the approval process for products in the catalogue.
First, the pre-certification product inspection organized by the issuing authority is changed t|o the product inspection c"onformity report issued b>y the qualified i|nspect|ion and testing institution when the enterprise applies.
Second, in addition to dangerous chemicals, the products that have been licensed by the qua\lity and technical supervision department (market supervision and management department) of the provincial people ’ s government s,hall be subject to post-site inspe-ction . After the enterprise submits t,he application and produc?t inspection conformity report and makes a commitment to ens'ure product quality and safety, t-he production license can be obtained after passi+ng th\e formal examination, and then the on-site examination is accepted within the specified time.
Third, for enterprises produce different types of products in the production and operation catalogue, i"n accordance with the principle of `'` o"n"e enterprise, o>ne license '\', when apply for a new license or appl!y for a license renewal, a license should be issued and examined.
The "Decision" requires tha\t all regi(ons and relevant departments should solidly promote the reduction of catalogue and simplify the examination and approval procedur&e&s.
Increase t+he commitment publicity of enterprises and post-s>ite inspection work, strengthen credit supervision and restraint me\ans, implement the responsibility of the main body of the enterprise, and revoke the production li.cens.e for false promises and non-compliance.
For the products that cancel the production licenses administration for industrial products, it is nece|s|sary to strengthen the post supervision, and the products related to public health and safet:y, environmental protection, etc . can be converted into compulsory certific~ation, list positive lists and publicize to th&e public, unify th<e certification standards and reaso%na%bl%y reduce and merge the certification and testing items, and the compulsory certification fees in p}r}inciple shou)ld be borne by the financial institutions a~t all levels.
Take support m?easures to encourage enterprises to carry out voluntary certification and promote brand buildin=g and market expansion.
It i<s necessary to benchmark the international advanced standards and promote the q`uality of industrial products.
Give full play to the role o<f third-party social organizations to ensure th<e quality and safety of industrial products.

First, the fundamentals of th<e manufacturing industry a&re generally stable.
Among the 2@1 surveyed industries, the PMIs of 14 industries are in the exp]ansion range . The manufacturing PMI of pharmaceuticals, special equipment a&nd e[le[ctrical machinery equipment are all at a higher operating level of 53.5%, and the growth rate i#s faster.

The PMI of large enterprises was 52.1%, w;hich was the same as that of the previous month . Since this year, the index h$as b)een in the expansion rang#e of 52.0% and above, and th>e production in"d"ex and the new order index have b(oth increased this month, which is the main driving f:orc:e for the expansion o)f the manufacturing industry .

Report of Reuters o[n November 5 in Nagoya: Haruhiko Kuroda, the president of t|he Bank o<f Japan said on Monday that t<h<e bank realized that the long-term implementation of ultra-easing mone.tary policy could squeeze the profit margins of financial institutions and destabilize the banking system of Japan.
However, he said t:hat due to the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank of Japan needed to maintain it's large-scale incentive plans and pay clos(e attention t/o the pros and cons of its policies.
"The Bank of Japa>n fully acknowledges t@hat un:de:r the sustained monetary easing policy, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Haruhiko Kuroda said in a speech to the b.usiness leaders in Nagoya.
He said that if financial institutions were more active in taking risks to compensate f&or the effect of lo+w interest rates on shrinking profit marg&in&s over the ye*ars, the banking s+ystem could be unstable in the event of serious negative impacts.
"Although these risks are not to(o big at present, the Bank of Japan will closely monitor the developmen{t of the situation and encourage financial institutions to take nece@ssary measures," h-e said.
The minutes re}leased by the Bank of Japan earlier on Monday showed that the policy committee o\f the Ba%nk of Japan discussed the problem of ri#sin#g costs of the long-term easing policy at the interest rate meeting in September.
The minutes showed tha?t a member o,f t&h&e board said that if the economy continued to expand, `-` the Bank of Japan will have more flexibility in the aspect of policy in the future. "
The minutes showed that another member of the board sa*id that due to the limits o<f policy duration, the committee should discuss how lon_g the Bank of Japan can maintain t\he incentive policy.
Haruhiko Kuroda said that the Ba{nk of Japan woul%d assess the f;inancial risks brought by the easing policy, and take into account the uncer/tainti/es c#entered on Japan's economic prospects, as China-U.S. trade frictions and rising protectionism might affect the global demand.
`@` T.he impact of such problems on Japan's economy is temporarily limited," Haruhiko Kuroda said.
"B!ut if t'he problem persists, the impact on Japan's economy may increase," he added.
`~` It is necessary to sustain t*he strong monetary easing policy and consider both positive and negative impacts in a balanced manner," Haruhiko Kuroda s;aid.
Although the disadvantages of radical incentive plans we!re increasing, such as lon\g\-term low interest rates eroding the profits of financi?al institutions, th?e low inflation forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
The Bank of Japan maintained the monetary policy la:st month; Haruhiko Kuroda ruled out the pos~sibility of recent interest rate increase about the risks bro~ught by the c=onf=li=ct of the global trade war.
O~n June 1, 2)01)8, in Cardiff, the United States, the corporate identi~ty on Tesla electric cars.
According to a settlement agreement, Tesla Motors a,nd its CEO, Mus`k, had agreed to separately pay $20 million fines to the financial regul'ato'rs, and Musk wou]l]d resign as President of the company, but still held the post o;f CEO.
This settlement agreement would end two months of unrest i"n T]esla.
This settlement agr\eement on securities fraud charge released b;y the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) on Sa{tu{rday would make investors relieved.
Investors were originally worri{ed th%at the protracted legal battle would only further hit t&he electric car company, which was still losing money.
SEC prosecuted Musk for frauds o\n Thursday, saying that his tweet on August 7 misled the i"nvestors.
The tweet said that he was considering to privatiz}e Tesl^a with $420 per share and had obtained financing.
SEC said that these tweets actually had no evidences and t+he volatility i}n marke\t triggered by them had hurt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts said that t@his agreement coul)d strengthen Tesla, which had been hit hard by M'u'sk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, the leader of assets management company of Boston Common, sai-d that t}his settlement agreement should let Musk receive more moni|toring, but had not taken any "destructive" measures t[o throw h*im out of Tesla.
This assets management company held shares of Panasonic, t(he battery manufacturer o,f Tesla.
According to this proposed agreement, Tesla mus|t appoint a independent president, tw+o independent directors an[d a board committee to set out cont[ro[l[s aiming at Musk ’ s external communications.
"This matter was resolved promptly according to the agreed conditions, which met th_e be-st interests of our market and our investors, including Tesla shareh(olders," SEC Chairman Clayton said i.n a statement.
The charge on Thursday caused the market value of Tesla evaporate abou:t $7 billion . The market value of this company w)as $45.2 billion, lo%w%er th|an $47.5 billion of General Motors.
S~E~C withdrew the requirement for throwing Musk out of the head position of t_he company.
Many i.nvestors said that this punishment would be catastrophic.
"I think it i^s t!he best possi!ble result for all relevant staff," Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners said . Feinseth gave a "neutral" evaluation t[o Tesla an/d said that the punishment of SEC was a "lighter punishment" to Musk.
"The fact that he still holds the position of CEO i{s ve!ry important to Tesla. "
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitte~d or denied the charge of SEC in the settlement agreement, or immediately replied to the r&equest for com>menting.
The settlement agreement still needed to get approval o{f t$he court.

For example, the changes in the international economic environment have h]ad an impact o\n some export enterprises; the rapid a-dj-ustment of the d!emand structure has brought about the pressure of transformatio~n and upgrading; some policies are not coordinated with each other, the policy effec)ts are superimposed in the same direction, or the working methods are simple, r;e;sulting in some policies wi>t>h good original intentions have the opposite effect, etc.
All k=inds of factors are intertwined, the p~rivate economy is facing difficulties, some private enterpr$i$ses are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lot of anxiety.
Under this context, it is particularly profound a(nd practical to co`r`rect the cognition error[s, let the entr#epreneurs ’ unload the mental load, let them develop wholehea'rtedly, make the government promote development devotedly and concern market confidence and development expectations.
This symposium o+nce again emphasized t\he important assertion of the "Three no-changes '^': "There is no change in the role and function of non-public sector i:n our economic and social development"!
In recent years, f.rom deepening the promotion of streamline administration an;d delegate more po/we/r to lower-level governments, establishing a power list system, and creating a legal environment that protec%ts the legitimate rights and interests o~f entrepreneurs, creating a market environment of fair competition an&d shaping the atmosphere o@f respecting entrepreneurs in the whole society, the Party Central Committee has attached unprecedented emphasis on entrepreneurs and institutional gua`r`antees.
The sy;mposium clearly st)ate)d the six aspects ’ pol,ic,y measures to vigorously support the development and expansion of private enterprises, and launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated to th"e "march with light packs" of private enter&prises.
These actions have greatly encouraged the entrepreneurial community a`nd have given more expectations t&o the community.
The fog has been set aside, an"d the policy has been set . And the key asp$ect lies i`n implementation.
We must continue t"o create a b.e.tte.r development environment for the private economy, help priv@ate ente\rpr\is\es solve the difficulties in development, and h[elp achieve China ’ s economic transformation and upgrading; let entrepreneurs feel fair in market competition, feel safe in legal operations, and f}eel respected in social life, stimulate innovation a"nd create potential.
The Chinese economy has stepped into a pro\cess of moving towards high-quality development, requiring more entreprene"urs to display their ambitions and providi(ng more spaces and st*ages for entrepreneurs to exert their creativity.
We have reason to believe that with furthe`r deepening reforms and removing obstacles, t$he private economy will greet better development prospects and opportunities and move toward a b,ro,ade,r s`tage.
46 types of import and expo!rt supervision lice#nses in Inner Mongolia have all been verified online - China News
Repo@rt on November 5 i.n Inner Mongolia of China News (reported by Li Aiping): the Hohhot Customs said on Nove!m!ber 5 that 46 types of local import and export supervision licenses were verified onlin(e from that day, except for confidentialit.y requirements and other special circumstances.
The enterprises i#n Inner Mongolia can declare relevant documents t@o the Customs in paperless way, so as t<o avoid the problems of rushing around on site, paper application, repe#ate#d submission, etc.
I.t was known that the preparation time of documents referred to the preparation time of various types of documents requir+ed for import and export before declaration, which was a major factor that affected the overall clearance time . In ord%er to compress the clearance time and re>duc>e the clearance costs, the document^s mu%st be reduced.
Previously, there we-re 86 types of supervision documents in the im'port and export process which required cust}oms examination, involving 19 departments.
It was reported that according to the principle of "t[o cancel what can be canceled, to merge wh:at can be merged and to withdraw what can be wi"thdra"wn from port inspection" this time an-d relying o-n the international trade "single window" platform, the Customs and o~ther 16 license-issu\ing authority systems made docking and data interconnection, to achieve more d(ata flows and less enterprise errands.
The customs said that in the past, enterprises had to g.o back and fo;rth to t_he onsite office hall of the relevant authorities to submit paper applications . The process was long and it was impossible t|o track the verification status in real t@im@e.
Now the enterprise users c)an directly log into the "single window" portal to appl"y online.
Upon approval of the license-issuing authority, the e[lec[tronic data of the certificate would be transmitted to the Customs, and automatic comparison and intell!ig!ent examination of the Customs declaration data would be done in the Customs clearance process . All the examination r'esults would be sent back to th*e enterprise through the "single window ')', which ca?n make the whole pr\o\ce\ss of declaration, examination, customs clearance and fe:edba:ck of supervision documents complete online.
Exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China surged 20 times in four years, whic~h may b$e related to the in;crease of empty-nest youth - China News
Exports of Korean ginseng chicken soup t&o China surged 20 ti'mes in four years; analysis: it is related to the increase o$f empty-nest youth
According t%o the re%port on Day 5 of Yonhap, las;t year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chic%ken soup t^o China exceeded 100,000 US dollars, which surged 20 times compared with that of four years ago, in 2013.
The analysis sug.gests that this growth i?s related to the hot sales of convenience food dri)ven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, a[s well as the increasing attention of young people on nutritious meals.
This data is published by th+e Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Co$rp (aT) on Day 5.
L|ast year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chicken soup to China was 100,339 U$S dollars and the weight was 21,859 kg, which surged b+y 2094% and 3668.8% respec{t{ively compared with that in 2013.
The ana?lysis suggests that the increasing sa;l;es of Korean ginseng chicken soup in China are related to the ho[t sales of convenience food driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the i)ncreasing attention of young people on nutritious mea`ls.
By the end of th}is y~ea~r, the number of one-person households in China have exceeded 200 million, a~nd it i;s expected to increase to 30% of the total population by 2020 . Local food ent^erprise^s ar\e also aiming at the “ eating-alone people" and launching various convenience food.
Moreover, the analysis also indi-cates that bird flu is the biggest factor w,hich prevents ginseng chicken soup from ta{king root in the Chinese mainland market.
aT says that bird flu outbroke i)n Sout~h Korea from November 20-1-6 to April of last year . Relevant departments comprehensively ban the export of ginseng c&hicken soup to China which leads to sharp reduction of export sales.
In 2016, the export sales of ginseng chicken soup in China was 840,000 US dollars . Due to bird f"l"u, the export sales o]f l=ast year plummeted to 100,000 US doll$ars.

"I didn't expec)t to see such a spectacular flag-raising ceremony on the frontier . It is more amazing t~o watch the flag-raising h?ere than in the mainland. "

Hekou port i]s the bigges[t port on China-Vietnam boarder in Yunnan . It is located in Hekou county in Honghe Prefecture i{n Yunnan Province with just a river away from Lao Cai City in Vietn>am . It is a first-class national po^rt.
With the continuous enhancement of `*` One Belt an~d One Road" construction in China, as one of t#he most convenient passage connecting China and Southeast Asia, Hekou port has a steady growth of departure a=nd en#try flow.

The ne!wly revised Ind.ividual Income Tax Law will adjust the criterion for resident taxpayers of China ’ s Individual Inco>me Tax Law from one year to 183 days.
On 30th, the relevant principals from the Ministry of Finance of the People ’ s Republic of China and State Administration of Taxation said that in order t+o main~tain the stability of the policy, t>he next step in implementing the new Individual Income Tax Law wil>l consider continuing to make preferential arrangements f:or fo/r/eigners, including Hong Kong, Ma'ca'o and Taiwan.
The principals expres~sed that the current effective Individual Income Tax Law ’ s enforcement regulations have special preferential provisions for taxation issues for foreigners . F;or individuals who do not have a residence in China but have lived for more than o|n|e year and less than fiv]e years and earn incom}e}s from outside China, th(eir p{art of the payment by domestic units or individuals is subje!ct to individual income tax.

For t}he profit distributed by overseas investors f#rom domestic enterprises in China used for the sco%pe of application of no withholding income tax policy for domestic direct investment, the f\oreig\n investment encouraged projects should be extended to all non-prohibited foreign in~ve~stment projects and fields.
During t"he 73rd United Nations General As!sembly, the parties released some positive information for the Korean Peninsula issue.
South Korean President Moon Jae-in related the "i]rr]eversi]ble" de'nuc'lea'risati'on determination as told by the DPRK and said th~at US President Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un may meet before the end o'f this year.
The U|S State Department subsequently stated that Secretary of Stat>e Pompeo will visit the DPRK i!n October to promote the implementation of the US-DPRK leadership meeting in Singapore.
From the beginning of this year to the prese*n*t, th|e DPRK a_nd the ROK broke the ice and opened t(he dialogue, and the DPRK - ROK and the DPRK-US leaders held meetings . The general trend of the easing of the peninsula h/as been continued, and the d:ialogue ’ s principle of solving the p;enins;ula issue has also been adhered to.
First of all, the fact that "the essence of the peninsula is/sue is a security issue" has not changed . The key to realizing peace o!n the peninsula is to resolve the reasonable security concerns of all p>a>r>t>ies i"n a prop/er and balance manner, instead of putting pressure o+n the other side a~nd stressing own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue to re^aliz^e the denuclearization o-f the peninsula, the parties concerned are still divided on the steps and ways to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula . Due to the long{-t{erm lack of political trust betw'een the DPRK a;n;d the United Sta?tes, the game thinking of "who is first and who is second" i_s still strong.
At the public meeting of the UN Security Council Kor*ean Peninsula issue held at the United Nations Headquarters in New York, the different voices of the parties around the issue o_f sanctions against the DPRK once again highlighted the two p$oint$s on th^e peni^nsula that have not changed.
Pompeo, US Secretary of State, insisted t.hat sanctions against North Korea will not be lifted until the Korea)n Peninsula is fully denucl,earized.
Lavrov, Russ,ian Foreign Minister, stressed the principle o"f "responding to action by action". He pointed o?ut: "The weakening trend of sanctions should be in synchronization with the pace taken by North Korea on the ro=ad of gradual denuclearization . '('
U#ndoub#tedly, all parties concerned should continue to implement the North Korea related resolutions of the UN Security Council in a comprehensive, complete and accurate manner . However, pressuring is not a=n end . The implementation of sanctions and t(he promotion of a political settlement are all requirements of the UN Security Council resolutions . The tw_o cannot be neglec\ted, and ca:n not only c]hoose one
A!s Chine>se State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi said, i"n view of the current positive developments in the DPRK-ROK and DPRK-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the UN Security Council to consider launching reversible clauses i}n a timely manner, th&ere&by encouraging North Korea and relevant parties t<o take a b>ig move toward denuclearization.
Review the past, every development in the denuclearization of the peninsula and in t~he peace pr%oce%s%s requires the parties to demonstrate sufficient politic^al courage.
At present, in the face o-f the in+te+rnational communit*y ’ s increasingly high expectations for promoting a political solution to the peninsula issue, all parties concerned should demonstrate political courage, make political de^cisions, impl}ement commitments, resolve problems, and continue to t]ake the opposite direction and advance peninsula denuclearization process a?nd establish a peace m~ec~ha~nism on the peninsula to jointly create a permanent peace on the peninsula.
A m}e}ssage from Ji County People's Government in Linfen City i@n Shanxi Province on Oc~tobe~r 1 indicated that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow Riv}er located in this coun/ty would maintain higher levels of water during the National Day holiday, so it did n='t meet the requirements to be open to the public.
I"n order to ensure the safety, the scenic areas will be t$emporarily closed during the National Day holiday.
Hukou Falls of Yellow River is the second bi=ggest fall i%n Chin~a, and the biggest yellow fall in the world.
The Yellow River flows here a|t great speed, and the stone walls on both sides a@re rising steeply . The river mouth bec|omes narrow like the spout of kettle, forming the situation t\hat "a thousand miles of Yellow River seems like to b&e collected into a kettle '}'.
The reporter learned that the flood season of yellow river would come in every June to Octo{ber . Due to high levels o{f wa"ter, the scenic are[as of Hukou Falls of Yellow River i,n Shanxi Province had been closed one after a$nother since July 12, 2018 . Therefore, according t`o the accumulative calculation, Hukou scenic areas had been closed for nearly a month.
Ni Yuf/eng, the chief engineer of Hukou Scenic Areas Management Committee, sa(id t-o the media that it was the longest ti(me for the Yellow River to keep high levels of water during the pas)t 20 years . "It hasn't been closed for such a lo}ng time . We closed it for four days in the flood season in 2017 . However, i}t has been closed for nearly a month. `&`
It was learned that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had originally arranged e(x(tra staff and vehi<cl<e maintenance in advance i\n order to b}e well-prepared fo!r the "National Day" golden week, and even the temporary staff had been hired.
According to the "Notice o`n Being Well-prepared for the Flood Control in the Yellow River during the National Day Holiday" i%ssued in the "Offic'e Telegram o|f Yellow River Flood Control and Drought Relief Headquarters", Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, I{nner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong were required to be well-prepared for the flood control i:n the Ye)llow River during the Natio^nal Day holiday.
Currently, the flow of t|he mai%n stream of the Yell_ow River is rel#ati#vely large . Th'e upstream river flow i~s maintained at 2000-3000 cubic meters per second, the midstream river flow is maintained at 2500―3500 cubic meters per second, and the downstream river flow is maintained at 3000 cubic meters per second.

To facilitate the citizens to vaccinate with flu vaccine during the holiday, al_l the health centers and health stations unde^r the Hea.lth Bureau will specially provide vaccination services from 9 am t<o 1 pm duri(ng the National Day Holidays (October 1 through 2).
In addition to the above-mentioned convenience measures, all the health cente}rs a'nd health stations under the Health Bureau have extended thei$r influenza vaccination servi~ce time to 8 p<m from Monday to Friday . By 4 pm o]n September 30, 4,158 people had been vaccinated, which was more than that of the sa]m]e period last year for 3,714 people.

Meanwhile, for the other people w;ho are considered to be n.ec.es.sary to vaccinate by t|he Health Bureau, i<ncluding the personnel of the public sectors, the Health Bureau will take the initiative to contact the relevant authorities to obtain t=he list and then the healt;h centers will arrange them for vaccination.
To f~acilitat~e the vaccinees and reduce the waiting time fo?r vaccination, the H#ealth Bureau will send medical sta>ff to Macao middle schools, primary sch\ools, kindergartens and nurseries from October to December to perform collective influenza vaccination to the children, students, teachers and staff; in addition, the Health Bureau will also arrange staff to go to the institutions of the e,lderly and disabled, public sectors or othe,r institutions with a larg_e number of peopl[e to perform collective influenza vaccination.
Students and children who fail to participate in t_he collective v!ac!cination can take Macao resident identity cards, user cards of the Health Bureau, influenza vaccination car,d,s (if any), student identity cards, emp#loyee identity cards or occupational certificates to the vaccination station of the Centro Hospi?talar Conde de S+ão Ja>n>uário or health centers from December 3, 2018.
Th;e Health Bureau re!minds residents th?at people who vaccinated with the 2017-2018 flu vaccine during September 2017 and August 2018 still need to vaccinate with the new seasonal flu vaccine from September 20>18, since the flu antigen composition of 2018-2019 flu vaccine in the Northern Hemisphere ha?s been updated, which is targeted at the seasonal influenza in winte&r of 2_01_8-_2019 and summer of 2019 in the Nor,thern Hemisphere.

Re;port of Reuters on Octobe<r 1 in Tokyo: A quarterly Tankan survey report released by the Bank of Japan on Monday showed that th?e confidence of Japanese major manufacturers hit its lowest level in more th}an a year fo+r t=hat season in September, as raw material c-osts rose and a series of natural disasters affected production, putting pressure on enterprises.
This survey almost didn ’ t show that the escalating global t#rad#e fric_tion_s shook the confidence of large manufacturers.
However, risks of outbreak of an all-out trade war stuck the busin*ess prospects o:f enterprises, likely to threaten the business capi(tal expenditure.
The active capital expenditure is a highlig{ht of Japanese ec+onomy.
This survey raised questions about the view o_f the Bank o)f Japan on that robust economic expansion would help t^o accelerate inflation to th*e 2% target, although there were signs that enterprises were gradually shifting costs to th(e customers.
"Wi'th concerns raised by the global trade war, a;s exports slowed down and factory production weakened, the confidence of manufactu|rers tended to stagnate," said Takeshi Minami, the Principal Researcher of Norinchukin Rese|arch Institut<e Co., Ltd ..
"Confident is still at a high level . A}nd since corporate profits are improv^ing an[d prices are rising, I don't think confidence will continue to decline. "
The Tankan survey showed that the judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing d%eclin%ed from positive 21 for three months ag~o t%o positive 19 in September, worsening for th#e third consecutive quarter.
The median ma=rket forecast is positive 22.
The judgment index for the boom of large-scale manufacturing declined fro/m positive 24 res.earc.hed in June to positive 22 i|n September, worsening for the first time for ei*ght quarters.
The survey of Reu&ters was positive 22.
The survey sh.owed that the judgment index f,or the boom of large-scale manufacturing and non-manufacturing wa's expected to remain stable in December.
Investors were indifferent to the decline of t(he judgment index for the boo-m of Tan,kan enterprises . The Nikkei .N225 rose to a 27-year high spot on Monday as the continued d(epreciation of the yen helped improve the exp]ort profit prospects of Japanese enterprises.
The capital expenditure was robu`st.
Although the confidence of enter:pris:es declined, the lat[est Tanka&n highlighted the robustness of enterprise capital expenditure plans, benefiting from the renewed capacity and increased investment in robots and automation t!o cope with the labor shortage caused by the agi_ng of population.
The Tankan survey of the Bank of Japan showed that th&e capital expenditure of large-scale enterp"rise plans would increase by 13%.4% for the fiscal year en$de$d in March 2019.
It w|as 13.6% for previous Tankan survey.
Takeshi Minami said that the capital expenditure o%f all enterprise plans for this fi(scal yea'r increased by 8.5%, close to the pace o"f Japan ’ s bubble era.
He said, "considering that smal~l businesses ra:ise their profit est(i(mates from now on, there is still room for further growth in capital expenditure, b!ut that largely depends on the impact of the trade war on business confidence. `/`
The Tankan survey showed t.hat the ability of enterprises to pass on costs wa]s enhanced . The output pric%e index of l)arg)e enterprises was positive 7, which was a 10!-ye!ar high spot . It was an encouraging sign, reflecting that Japan had made progress in its efforts to combat defla=tion.
The index measurin&g the employment situation o%f large enterprises hit negative 23, which w?as the most tight level since 1992, highlighting the tightening of the employment market.
Benefiting f=r=o=m the robust enterprise expenditure, Japanese e@conomy rebounded from January-March shrink in the second quarter.
However, the escalation of trade frictions in summer and the disturbance of natural disasters on s=upply chains had casted a shadow ove^r the prospects o%f Japanese economy which depended on exp#o#r#ts.
In d{ollar terms, import a`nd export of services increase by 16.4%.
The news release of the website of the Ministry of Commerce citing the head of the Department of Trade in Services and Commercial Services sa)id that the total import and export volume of emerging ser)vices exceeded 1 trillion yuan from January t(o August, and the growth rate w~as faster than that o'f t"he whole.
Am&ong them, the tot~a~l import and export volume o^f emerging services was 1,138.39 billion y>uan, with an increase of 20?.9%, which was 10.4 percentage points higher than the overall growth rate of import and export of services, and the proportion of promotion f}o}r emerging services increased by nearly 3 percentage points.
In terms of service export, the service export continued its rapid growth momentum since t!his y\e\ar, and the export g^rowth rate w$a$s 5.7 percentage points higher than the import growth rate from January to August.

T#he head of the Department of Trade in Services and C^ommercial Services also pointed out t<ha<t the proportion of import of emerging services also gradually increased f\rom January to August.
The import of emerging ser;vic;es in!crea!sed rapidly, accounting f>or 23.6% of service import, with an increase o_f 1.6 percentage points over the same period last year from January to August.
Among them, the import growth rates of financial se[rvice[s, intellectual property rights usage fees, an-d te_lecommun_ica_tions, computer and information services a<l<l exceeded 20%, with 47.1%, 23.3% and 23.2% respectively.

Report o]f R;euters on Novemb{e{r 5 in Beijing: According to a press release released on Sunday by t:he China Foreign Trade Center, the Canton Fair showed that th=e situation o"f China's foreign trade was still complex and serious, with expectation of 80.=6% of enterprises exports in 2018 to be better than or maintain at the same level as last year.
However, in consideration of the rising costs of domestic raw mater*ials, labo-r force and other comprehensive factors, as well as the external environment of the increasing impac"t of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibitors also believed t?hat the export situation of next year was not optimi*st*ic.
At the closing press conference of t@he 1=24th Canton Fair, Xu Bing, the deputy secretary-general and spokesman of the Canton Fair, and the vice-director of t:he China Foreign Trade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions of this Canton Fair h.ad de%clined s.lightly compared with the same period of last year.
The number of buyers who attended this Canton Fair was 189,81;2 and t;hey came from 215 countries and regions, with a dec;rea;se of 1.11% on year-on-year basis.
The amo^unt of export transa[ctions was 206.494 billion yua:n ($29.86 billion), with a decrease of 1% on year-on-year basis.
From the perspectiv@e o~f the market, the transactions with Japan, the ten ASEAN countri)es, "the BRIC&S countries" and Korea increased by 74.4%, 11.4%, 7.2% and 2.5% respectively, while the transactions w'ith traditional markets o@f t,he Unit)ed States, Australia, Canada and the European Union decreased by 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% and 0.8% respectively.
From the per]spective of the industry, the t]ransac]tions of transportation tools, machinery and equipment, building and decorative materials, electronic co#nsumer goods, informatio%n products, and sanitary equipment increased b"y 24.8%, 21.?1%, 20.0% and 15.1% respectively, while the transactions with textile clo_thing and household appliances decreased by 13.0% and 6.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer and weathervane of China's foreign trade, the buyers ’ participation situation and the export transaction data of this Cant]on Fai&r showed that China's foreig*n trade development would still face many uncertain and unstable factors ne"xt yea_r.
However, with the deepening of supply-side structural reform and the "six stability" policies and measures recently introduced by t'h'e state and local governments i$n succession, the new d(rive(rs for the development of China ’ s foreign trade was accelerating the accumulation, and the diversification of enterprises and markets had mad$e ne.w progress, all of which were the important foundation and strong co*nditions fo(r t@he development of foreign trade.
"Taking all factors into consideration, it is expected that t*he imports and exports of China's foreign trade will maintain a steady growth throughout t}he year, with f\urther improvement in quality and e.fficiency. "Xu Bing sa"id.
The China ’ s General Administration o)f Customs published t/hat priced in dollars, th`e exports in September increased b}y 14.5% on year-on-year basis, the imports incre{ased b<y 14.3% on year-on-year basis, the trade surplus in September was $31.69 billion, and the export growth rate and trade surplus in September were the highes=t since February.
In despite of the escalating trade frictions between China and the Un!ited States, China '.s export performance in September still s>ignificantly exceeded expectation . Strong external demand, a^n^d the en!terprises rushing to export before imposing tariffs in the United S@tates and the depreci#at#ion of RMB exchange rate, might be the ma'in supporting factors, and also show|ed the resilience of Ch}ina's foreign trade to a certain ex}tent . However, the impact of the Sino-US trade w|a|r on confidence and the industrial chain cannot be neglected . Analysts believed that the challenges for China's foreign trade might emerge in the fourth quarter or next year.
Reuters surveys showed that the U.S. fund managers proposed to increase cas*h holdings and stood the cautious ground in September, since the Unit=ed States and Chin_a bega!n the latest round of m#utual import tariffs and there was no sign of dispute easing.
However, according to the suggestion of 12 fund managers wh-o participated in this s#urv#ey, t,he asset allocation in North America rose to t%he highest level sin}ce June 2017, while positions in Britain, the Eurozone and particularly emerging markets declined.
Th}e average o?f global stock allocation accounted for 56.6% and the bonds accounted for 35.5%, which wa|s basically consistent with the survey of last month.
The most obvious change was th&at the cash r#atio rose to 5.1%, which was the highest proporti:on since December 2014.
A fund mana!ger of a large fund company said, "Some economic data have brought confidence to the market, but t`he trade war i`s still the biggest concern, so that it's better to get prepared to enter w>hen t+he market falls after a rise. "
However, the fund managers stil!l preferred stocks in September, especially American stocks, even thoug&h the price of American stocks were considered to be on the hig^h s:id:e.
Today, in Shanghai, the opening-up landmark of China, China International Import Expo (CII`E), the world's first large-}scale state-level exh"i"b"i"tion with the theme of import, has o]ff]icially opened in much anticipation.
An exhibition is l?ike a "window" which can l!et the world know a ci`ty and a country better.
Through the "window ':' o;f CIIE, people can see the "o^p^ening-up China" which moves towards a hi,gher level; with the help of the "window" of C`IIE, we welcome the world and Chi~na which is "restarting from reform and opening-up", to achieve mutual benefits and win-win results.
"For a country, opening-up is li@ke coming out of the coc!oon and becoming a butterfly . There will be pain, but there will be new life&. "
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of Open Road reve[als an important reaso\n "why China can do i]t".
Looki%ng back on the pas{t 40 years of ref/orm and opening-up, China dares to plunge into the vast sea of the world market . Although it has encountered whirlpool and storm, it always fac#es all risks and challenges with an open attitude, constantly releases its endogenous driving force and continuously improves i_ts competitivenes)s.
S?o to speak, China h#as fully demonstrated the value and significance of opening-up with its solid achievements.
Standing at a new historical starting point, it is a m"ajor decision to hold an expo with the theme of import made by th*e Party Cen*tral Committee with the core of Comrade Xi Jinping w#ith a view to promoting a new round o&f high-level opening to the outside world . It is a major measure for China to actively open the market to the world an;d is also a practical action taken by China to support the economic globaliz'ation and tr)ade liberalization, showing a strong and clear will that `+` China's opening door won't close, bu|t would open wider and wider '"'.
Exhibitors from all over the world are eager to enroll i,n the exhibition, and "it is difficul"t to apply for a stand '_', which is the greatest affirmation and best respon[se to China ')s development of an open economy in a larger scope, a wider range of fie=lds and at a deeper level.
Mo>re importantly, the current global economic a<nd trade order has reached a crossroad.
Some countrie~s have built trade protectionist walls and retreated into the unilateralism, which increases anxiety of the inte~rnational society about the prospects for free trade an[d adds much uncertainty to a recovering w>orld economy.
U[nder such era background, this grand gatherin@g along the Huangpu River demonstra>tes China's guard to free trade and shows the world China's confidence and responsibility to open its market.s and share its future.
It is fast to g@o alone but i~t is further to go in crowds.
By embracing t"he world with an open mind, China has not only vigorously promoted its own de-vel-opment, but also brought abou&t tremendo'us "China opportunities" to other countries and regions.
In recent years, by advocating and promoting th:e joint development of t'he "One Belt and One Road", initiating and setting up the Asia%n Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), an'd establishing the Silk Road fund...China has provided a series of international pub'lic g%oods, a solid export market, development opportunities and jobs, allowing companies of v"arious countries to get a ride on the `+` express train" an_d take "hitchhiking" of China's development.
C$I$I$E is also this kind of public goods a{nd a big platform for global economic and trade cooperation.
On this platform, more than 3,000 enterprises from more t-ha-n 130 countries and regions have made their debut with high-quality products and services with distinctive f)eatures, ta:king a new step into t|h|e Chinese market.
Apart from companie"s of various countries, th-e real beneficiaries are domestic consumers.
By building the platf"orm of "selecting the best and importing t@he best", we can provide multiple channels of high-quality supply for consumption upgrading and meet people '+s personalized, diversified and diff_ere_nt_iated consumption needs.
As China's opening-up door opens wider and wide,r, t\he goods flow is smoo-th a\nd materials are put to good use, thus the pace towards a better life will be more solid.
From a broader perspective, the sig{nificance of CIIE has gone beyon]d the scope o"f economy a\nd trade . I!t has the future in mind, conveys the concepts of openness, inclusiveness, universal benefit, bal~ance and win-win, and forms a consensus to jointly meet today's challenges.
Only when the wor%ld is doing wel)l can China d_o well; when China is good, the world is better.
We exp_ec_t CIIE to make the w\orld wonderful and complete; we are looking forward to the bright future that an "opening-up China" moving to a higher level and the w\or\ld build a community of huma/n destiny.

Over 90% o.f Brazilian female voters said that the presidential candidate did not consider women ’ s need?s.
According to the Overseas Chinese News Netw)or)k of So%u%th America, data released by Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) recently show$ed that more than 9\0% of Brazilian women do n%o%t think that the presidential candidate considers the needs of women.
According t_o the report, the number of women in Brazil has reached 107 million . I*f women from a*ll over Brazil are brought together to form a country, the country ’ s population will rank 13th i%n the world, more than twice the population o?f Spain.
In Brazil, the number of the women v\o\ters accou_nts for 5[2% o|f the total number of vot`ers, and me\n account for 48% . Although the proportion of women among voters is very high, the proportion of women in the National Congress of Brazil is only 10%.
A@m@ong th^e 193 countries in the world, Brazilian women ’ s participation in politics ranks only 1^54th, higher than that of Arab countries.
After more than 20 years o?f pow]er struggle, Brazilian w$omen still have not succeeded in obtaining their reserved rights.
According to Brazilian sociologist Natalia Mori, the exist*enc*e of this phenomenon is because of t&he combined effects of ancie?nt patriarchal society, racialism, and capitalism values.
"Poli@tics should be civil right{s, identity, access to public goods, and the formation of the same socie/ty by multiple social gro=ups advocated by citizens . But the politics of Brazil be#l#ong to a monop,oly of a certain group, and most of the population is not represented. "
A previous study b=y the Locom-o-tiva also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian women do not feel that the politicians elected by the election can repre_sent their rights, and 9?0% of Brazilian women dis$agree with the decisions made by politicians . 93% of women disagree with t~he current government policy.
"We need to reverse the pro[blem of underrepresentation of women in National Congress, and Brazil ’ s political system i^s still affected by inequality . So f[a[r, there has been serious gende[r, class and rac&ial discrimination in the political fie(ld in Brazil. "Natalia Mori said.
Although there is the lack of women ’ s ri!ghts, mo~st Brazilian women still believe i*n the power of democracy.
Th|e survey show{s that 76% of women believe they can make a differe+nce in democratic elections, and 72% of women are interested in politics.
In addition, 55% of women believe that democratic politics i(s the be-st wa;y to expose women to less prejudice.

As gro_wth in Europe, Asia and emerging markets is mostly not encouraging, the United States is increasingly becoming the mai}n engine of glob|al economic growth.
On September 23, 2018, a container ship be+rthed i'n a port in New Jersey, USA.
How&eve&r, since the current growth in the United State*s benefits from a fiscal stimulus of tax cuts which b\uy time, the count@ry's economy also attracts close attention of the outside world.
"As the United States i@s restoring full employment, the economic downturn i^s inevitable. "
H#e said that the only question is when i.t would happen . I/n his view, it can only happen in advance but not later.
Although B(arclays is optimist`i`c about the outlook for the U.S. economy by the end of this year, the bank acknowledges t[hat it is more diff!icul!t to predict the longer term.
"Under the circumstance that is la)ck of more sustaina`ble investment growth to bo#ost economic growth potential, current fiscal policy-driven growth will be unsustainable," Economist Barclays indicated in a res^earch report.
"On the occasion o<f being lack of investment grow?th, the risk of a hard landing of economy in 2020 wi|ll rise," they said.
A series of enterpri@se surveys will roughly sho{w th,e phase of business cycle for major economies at the end of the third quarter.
The Eurozone and American manufacturing surveys, which is schedul{ed for release next Monday, will be given attention and a serv,ice sector survey will b+e released on Wednesday.
However, the focus of data for n#ext week will definitely be the American non-fa:r:m employment data, which will be releas'ed next Friday . This da>ta will provide clues for whether th|e tight job market is driving large wage growth.
Its importance is not only for t@he reason that it i-s important for corporate profitability a*nd consumer purchasing power, but also be@cau@se wage jumps may cause overall inflation, which ma.y upset the officials of the Federal Reserve Board.
`)` Salari~es will be of great concern, as they may rise sharply again compared with the last month.
In September, the growth may not e}xceed 3% over the same period last year, but we can fully expect a breakthr.ough next m/onth," ING economists wrot=e in a research report.
On th}e occasio}n that holidays in China and other regions of Asia lead to a bleak dat?a for the region next week, the European political situation may become a source o%f market volatility.
The Italian government disrega+rds previous financial commitments to the EU, and other EU Member States will have to quickly determine whether to resolutely oppo}se this decision . Tria d*oe*sn't support this decision, and he h+o+pes to comply wi*th the EU rules.
As Brexit negotiations enter a critical stage, the ann^ual meeting of British Conservative Party i)n Birmingham may also c:ause sparks fly.
Meanwhile, as Brazil will hold its widely anticipated pres}idential election next weekend, concerns about em"er"ging markets a)re unlikely to subside.
[Abstract] Upon completion, this vessel will be delivered to t(he Eas_t C#h#ina Sea Branch of China's State Oceanic Administration for use . Chen Zhi, the director of the Observation Division of Marine Early Warning and Monitoring Department of China's Ministry o%f Natural Resources, said it would be of great significance to develop China's offsho=re ocean observation sy/stem and promote global ocean obs>ervation after the vessel came into us&e.

ECNS, Qingdao, October 1--Af<fected by Typhoon Trami, the first race day of 2018 Qingdao "Maza;rin" Cup powered b~y Extreme Sailing Series wa:s postponed from September 30 to October 1, and the pre-game meeting was held before t>he race in Olympic Sailing Center in Qin)gdao . The captains o"f 12 hydrofoil catamaran teams from 6 countries and regions attended at the meeting.
Affected by Typhoon Trami, the strong winds constantly ble?w in the harbor basin and the maximum wind speed e&ven reached 24 knots . The sailing signal was delayed by nearly 90 minu"tes from 1:00 pm on Sep]tember 3'0 . The wind speed was still n:ot reduced, so the Race Director Anne Mallédant announced to cancel the race o^f th|e first day and postpone the race to the afternoon on October 1.
"The strong w#inds from the shore never seem to stop, and th^e state of the sea is so sever@e. "
Mallédant explained: "N>o one knows the time whe"n the gust will blow to the racing boats as well as the scale o*f wind force.
Since the boat-sailing field is near the city, so far as it goes, the wisest choice is t"o c+ancel the rac+e. "
T#he sailors still felt a little disappointed fo]r everything was ready.
"The r|a|cing bo{ats are ready, and we are in excellent condition. "
The helmsman of Qingdao T'eam Max Richardson said frankly: "But I know it is a right choice to chan\ge the r;ace date . And I hope the wind will die down today, s#o that we c*a*n do some good. "
Micah Wilk-inson, the "Hope Star" of New Zealan=d Team for 2020 Tokyo Olympiad, sa]id: "Losing a day '=s time makes the race more interesting.
Bec@ause the race content will be increased today, and there will be only two days left fo^r t&he race.
All of us will p>lay hard. "
Thou.gh th>e sea wind blew violently, the helmsman of French ABM Team Pierre-Yves Durand told his warm memories with Qingdao at the pre-game me*eting that he was accidentally injured in the Extreme Sailing Series 5 year{s ago, resulting in the muscular rupture, and fortunately, the loc\al rac!e medical tea]m helped him deal w+it+h it so that he could stand here to take part in the race after 5 years.
It was learned that the Extreme Sailing Series started from 2007, a,nd i!t was a_n ISAF game equivalent to the Volvo Ocean Race, the America's Cup an*d the World Match Racing Tour.
The hydrofoil catamaran of "FlyingPhantom" would be use}d in this race i)n Qingdao.
It is the 8th year of having this race in Qingd|ao, the "C\ity of Sails". An>d it is the last race of this Series.
Although the turbulence i]n global financial markets continued, the Hong Kong M,oneta,ry Authority said on M`onday that the inve,stment income of the Exchange Fund in t+he third quarter of this year fell by 97% annually, and it was bet[ter than that in the previous quarter, since overseas st{ocks rose and foreign exchange losses obviously narrowed under the China-U.S. trade war.
According to the latest data of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the Exchange Fu<nd recorded investment income of HK $1.6 bill+io+n fro;m July to September 2018, significantly lower than HK $61.8 billion i]n the s(ame period last year, but better than the revised HK $100 million i_n the second quarter of this year.
Chen Delin, the president of the Hong Kong Monetary Aut'horit'y, said on the legislative session that at th^e beginning of th@e China-U.S. trade war, the share index in Hong Kong and emerging markets ran co?u?nte?r to the U.S. share index . By the end of September and early October, after the U.S. share index peaked in succession, the marke~t sentiment b,egan to reverse, since investors gradually re<alized that the trade war was also detrimental t*o the U.S>. itself.
"It is good to have changes in the market sentiment . If the t<rade war only h?a?s unilateral effects, it doesn't help much for solvi]ng problems. "
He also pointe@d out that "if the trade war cannot be solv"ed, the fluctuation of financial markets will continue to rise. `[`
In the third quarter of this year, the st;ock investment losses of the Exchange Fund in Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK $4.7 billion compared wi>t>h the pr{evious quarter, a>nd the investment in}come of overseas stoc]k increased by 17.2% to HK $12.8 billion; t!he foreign exchange losses was HK $16.2 billion and the bond yields was HK $9.7 billion, with a decrease of 24% and 3%1% respectively, mainly reflecting t-he general ris*e of the US dollar for exchange of major currencies i>n this quarter and the rise of the US coupon rate to above 3% i"n mid-September.
The Exchange F<und was mainly used for supporting Hong K!o!ng dollars.
Hong Kong has implemented the linke;d exchange rate system for the Hong Kon[g dollar's peg to the US dolla|r since 1983.
A+s f'or the current financial situation in Hong Kong, Ch<en Delin said that the uncertainty of the economic and asset markets increased and downside risks increased, but the financial system Hong Ko;ng was rob!ust, so that good defence were made and the earthquake-resistant capacity was abundant.
"The international investment position is abundant in Hong Kong, with a n+et external asset value o;f US $1.4 trillion, which is 4 tim|es GDP, higher than 2.5 times in Singapore and 0.6 times in J=apan . It is enough to cope with the fi%nanci%al downturns or reversal. `:`
The current daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall and the interest margin w\it\h US dollars expanded . Chen Delin poi`nted out that the exchange rat:e of the Hong Kong dollar rose more than 400 basis points on September 21 . The markets generally believed that it was ma<in<ly related to the rise o?f the daily interest rates on private lo=ans o]f Hong Kong dollars . And then the Hong Kong dollar hovered around 7{.8{0-7.8{4 fo|r exchange of the U:S dollar . Until recently, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars continued to fall, and the interest margin with US dollars expanded, which might attract mor`e hedging activiti&es to sell th~e Hon%g Kong dollar and buy the US dollar, triggering the opportunity of the exchange guarantee of the weak s,ide again to increase compared with t\h\at of the previous period.
However, he believed that as the interest-rate rise cycle of the Hong Kong Bank began and the Hong Kong d@ollar interest rates wer"e normalizing, the situation that Hong Kong dollar interest rates were lowe[r than US dol-lar interest rates would change in the fu)ture.
"The trend of Hong Kong dollar interest r]ates and US dollar interest rates will be more consistent . Ev[ery[one must be more careful to mana=ge risks and prepared to cope wit,h market fluctuations. "
Since the funds of the Hong Kong dollar was abundant, the daily i>nterest rates on privat!e loans of Hong Kong dollars fell further . The three-month daily interest rates on private loan fell by 0.:9% to 2.0817~9% on Monday, and the interest rat"e di/fferential with the US dolla-r increased from 46 basis poin|ts to 51 basis points; the one-month daily interest rates on private loan hit the bottom within five months, and the interest rate differential with th,e US dollar increased from 120 basis poin;ts to 127 basis points.
From M;ay to mid-September, the sp_ot rate o_f Hong Kong dollars was close to 7.85 with exchange of $1 most of the time.
During that time, due to factors of partial s,hare offer gained outflows from Hong Kong dollars after the completion of interest arbitrage activities and large-scale share offer activities, causing that t-he exchange guarantee for th~e weak side was tr.iggered for the first time in April, and for many times i'n Ma]y and August.
The Hong Kong Monetary Authority bo>ught Hong Kong dollars and sold Ho.ng Kong dollars at the level of 7.85 according to the linked exchange rate system, in order t-o maintain the stability of the exchange rat^e of Hong Kong doll&ars.
The Hon.g Kong Monetary Authority bought a*round HK $52.1 billion under t(he mechanism of exchange guarantee of the weak side from May to August.
Does foreigners can benefit fro]m the new Individual Income Tax La)w?
On 30th, the relev$ant person in charge from Ministry of Finance and State Administration of Taxation answered the reporters that in order to maintain the stability o(f the policy, the next ste"p in implementing the new Individu*al Income Tax Law will consider continuing to make p|referential arrangements for foreigners, includ}ing Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
Some reporters ask<ed that the newly revised Individual In&come Tax Law will adjust the criterion for resident t"axpayers of Ch)ina ’ s Individual Income Tax Law from one year to 183 days.
"May I ask if there are any preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Ko`n`g, Macao a}nd Taiwan, in im|p|lementin|g this new law?"
The principals res"ponded that the current effe\ctive Ind{i{vidu{al Income Tax Law ’ s enforcement regulations have special preferential provisions for taxation issues for foreigners . For individuals who do not h=av=e a residence in China but have l<ive<d for m|or|e than on|e year and less than five years and earn incomes from outside China, their part of the payment by domestic units or individuals is subject to individual income t\ax.
The principals said that in or`der to maintain the stability of the pol#icy, the next step in implementing the new Individual Income T&ax Law will consider continuing to make prefer^ential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao a}nd Taiwan.
The confinement center without "threshol*d": qua*lity certification would promote the quality.
As the `>` two-child economic" develops and the maternal and child mar_ket thrives, various gr*ades o]f confinement service centers appeared around China, from Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou to the 3rd and 4th tier cities.
The popular confinement service centers, which could sa/tis/fy the consum;er's demands, charged from tens of thousands of yuan to hundreds of thousands of yuan . However, they w?ere in a]n awkward situation, because this kind o+f institution had no threshold at all, and there w{as still the There is still a bl_an_k zone in regulation.
Recently, the State Administration for Market Regulation carri@ed out a series of activities of 2018 National "Quality Month ',' . The reporter came t@o a fi(ve(-star confinement center in Tianjin to explore the certification of maternal a^nd child care services.
A common co_nf_ine_ment cen]ter provided the services of newborn care, nutritious food, and postpartum reconstruction, etc.
The reporter found in this confinement center that the nurses would check th`e newborn breastfeeding each day, and the professional nursing workers would provide th!e newborns with the careful nursing services, such as bat_hing and to/uching.
In o-rder t{o satisfy th<e new moth$er's demand, it would provide the wound care in the beginning of confinement, bodybuilding care in the middle and later periods o}f confinement, Chinese traditional cosmetic treatment and other nursing items to help the new mother restore her graceful fig?u?r?e.
A new mother there tol.d the reporter that she had b%ooked this confinement service center 8 months in advance.
The service items of confinement service cent\er would directly impact the parturient's comfort and bo_dy recovery during t{he confinement . Some small confinement service centers could on~ly provide some simple services during the confi&neme&nt, but there were many problems and hidden troubles, in+cluding the irregular sterilization and sanitation, i|nci|dental cross infection, limited and unscientific diet, etc.
The responsible p$erson o}f this confinement cen-te-r said that they were the only one five-star confinement center in Tianjin, which had been certified as a Grade B se:rvice provider.
"Some customers didn't understand the meaning of the Grade B certification at first, b[ut th.e fact forcing the enterprises to strictly implement the standardized process management through certification will benefit t*h*e cus|tomers . I"t is important for the long-term development of enterprises. "he said.
Pan Lifen, the deputy director of the Attestation Su,pervision Department of t$he State Administration for Market Regulation, said that the service certification wa%s a new kind o&f certification system, which was ba_sed on the customers' perception and focused o*n the organizational quality management and satisfaction of service characteristics . It was an important part of t\he national quality infrastructure, a]nd had a posi,tive effects on increasing the proportion of quality services and enhancing China's international service competitiveness.
After mo're than 10 y"ears of development since 2004, the service certification project in our countr:y had gone through a process of developing from s!cratc!h . A series o%f influential service certification had appe=ared, including the financial service certification, mother and baby nursing service certification, after-sales service certification, electronic commerce service certification, and health care service certificati%on.
According to the statist#ics of the State Administration for Market Regulation, there are more than 130 servic]e certification institutions with over 2000 service certification staff a;nd nearly 8000 valid authentication certificates a@t present in our country.
Pan Lifen said that it was necessary to furt&her guide a/nd promote the development of service certification, gradually extend the coverage of service certification in the fi/elds of health, education, spo>rts, finance and electronic commerce, and boost the supply-side reform and qua/lity enhancement in t-he service industry.
Report of Reuters on November 5 in Hong K{ong: the property price in Hong Kong fell for two consecutive m;on;ths after peaking . Ch&en Delin, the pr?esident of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Monday that it needed t@ime to observe whether the property market had e@ntered downturns . If confirmed, it can b\e considered to successively ease the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures at an appropriate t[im[e.
Ch=en Delin also pointed out that if the property price fell, the first to be affected w>o>uld be those who bought prope~rties at the peak of the property market, but i|t was expected that there would be less opportunities to occur the situation like sh"arply falling property prices and the properties substantially sold by the citizens during the Asian F=ina=nc=ial Crisis in 1=997.
When leading multiple senior leaders o/f the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to attend the briefing session of the legislative session, Chen Delin said that i^f t]he propert-y market was determined to enter downturns, the ease of meas(ur(es can be made in succession at an appropriate time.
"However, si)nce data of a few weeks only can currently be seen, it's st!ill too early to ea,se, and it need$s more time to see whether the property market is entering downturns. "
Since October 2009, th~e Hong Kong Monetary Authority has successively l{aunched ei}ght rounds of counter-cyclical measures t#o substantially tighten the mortgages of various properties, including reduction of t%he number of mortgages, and th!at the mortgage applicants have to pass rigorous stress tests, in order to improve the bank risk management and shock resistance.
As Hong Kong f+ormally entered the intere]st]-]ra]te rise cycle, the house price index of private houses in Hong Kong peaked for two consecutive months in Augu`st and September and then fe/ll, and the monthly de]cline in September even expanded to 1.44%.
However, the cumulat\ive increase in the first three quarters of this year was still 10`.2%.
Accordin|g t\o th>e data of the Hong K.ong Monetary Authority, the household financial conditions for the ability of Hong Kong to withstand financial risks were measured to be healthy . In the second quarter this year, the percent!age of households of self-occupation non-mortgage residence in Hong Kong was 6!6%, which was higher than t=he average of 60% i-n 2009-2011; the average loan-to-value ratio of the newl^y approved mortgage and the percentage of contribution and income of the newly approved mortgage was 47% and 34% respe|ctively, with obvious improvement compared with 64% an(d 41% in 2009-2011.
However, Chen Delin said that high sho*ck resistance didn ’ t mean the citizen(s w;ho had bought properties wouldn ’ t be suffered damage o!f financial downturns, since the property valuation would fall, a'nd those who bought properties at peak times wo~uld be the first to be affected.
Although the Hong Kong Monetary Authority tightened the lending of the bank to th|e mortgage borrowers, those who bought properties can also get a high-percentage mortgage lo>an by means of the mortgage insurance, t'he mortgage l{o{an p?r?ovided by the developer and so on.
Chen De$li$n said that currently together with the mortgage loan provided by the developer, the mortgage percentage o%f th+e borrower can reach 85-90% . If th'e pr,operty price fell by 10%, there would be negative assets (i.e . the market value of the property fell below the level of the total outstandi]ng mortgage loa;n).
However, Ruan Guoheng, t)he vice president o#f the Hong Kong Monetary Authority pointed out t&hat the Authority esti!ma!ted the total high-percentage mortgage loan provided by the developer to account for 2-2.5% of the total mortgage of th,e bank, with lower proportion.
At the pea-k time of ne.g.ati.ve assets in Hong Ko$ng in 2003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100,0%00, with proportion of 22% in those who took mortgage.
As of t\he third quarter of this year, H<ong Kong recorded zero negative asset for seven consecutive quarters.

ECNS, Shenzhen, October 1 (reported by Zheng Xiaohong, Xu Dianwei & Liu Shumeng)--It was the first day o:f the National Day "Golden Week" in the mai$nla$n$d on October 1 . A&nd it was also the last d+ay of the National Day public holiday i+n Ho*ng Kong . Many mainla]nd residents used this hol!iday to travel a<nd g\o shopping acr=oss the borde^r, while many H]ong Kong residents r[et[urned to Hong Kong after visiting Shenzhen . The passenger volume of Shenzhen ports was "full to bursting", and the ports in Luohu and Shenzhen Bay had newly opened 22 automated gateways . This would improve the clearance efficiency in ports and facilitate the passengers to be cleared by the customs effectively and rapidly.
A(cco(rding to th*e data provided by Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection, over 42900%00 people an}d over 168000 vehicles had be~en transported across the boa"rder by 16:00 that afternoon . The ports had always been busy and orderly with a good order of entry and exit.
It was learned that there were an increasing number of passengers tak-ing advantage o:f t#h#e National Day holiday to visit the countries in Europe and Southeast Asia to go shopping affected by many positive factors, such as there were more coun.t.rie.s providing the v^i^sa-free policy f$or the Chinese citizens.
The passenger (car) flow peak i:n the exit direction in the ports in Luohu, Shenzhen Bay, Hu?anggang, and Futian occurred in the morning of October 1 . The p_asse_n_ger flow peak in Luohu port l>asted from 9:00 am to 11:00 a\m, and the passenger (car) flow peak in Shenzhen Bay port lasted fro:m 6:30 am t-o the noon at 13:00.
According t@o the introduction, in order to cope with passenger (car) flo%w p{eak across the boarder, Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry F"rontier Inspection followed the uni$f$ied de`ployment of the State Imm\igration Administration to start the service mode of passenger (car) flow peak period, arrange the policemen t{o work overtime to support those working in the front-line on duty, open enough passages for inspection and examination in advance, ensure that the queueing time of Chinese citizen's exi/t and entry would no,t exceed 30 minutes while taking into account o(f the foreigner's clearance efficiency; the order maintenance i$n the crowded was en&hance&d, and the customs clearance was ensured to be safe and orderly.
Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Front+ie+r Inspection also reminded the travelers across t\he boarder to pay attention to the expiry date*s of their certificates, visas, and endorsements before their trips, make the travel arrangement in a reason[able w<ay, try to avoid the passenger flow peak period an;d choose a right time and a right port to t$rave$l.
The passengers headed for H}ong K#on#g via Guangzhou-Shenzhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link must take their valid exit & entry documents, visas and endorsements . The high-speed r`ail ticket could be used as a proo>f of payment only, but not the exit and entry certificate . Anyone, who couldn't go to Hong Kong across the boarder due to th#e reasons such as the documents and procedures were not satisfiable, s"h"ould follow t(he guide of the policeman on duty i\n the Frontier Inspection, and g\o to the designated site t.o wait for the staff of MTR corporation t*o g:uide them to go through the procedures of returning the mainland by train.
Systemic lupus erythematosus is a chronic and s;tubborn disease involving multiple organs of the body . It used to be considered as an `.` inc!urab!le disease".
Because its pathogenesis is unknown, diagnosis and treatm@ent are difficult, and t]here is lack of effective treatment, it is hard to cure once and f<or all.
Recently, Li{u Wanli, a researcher at t>he Schoo+l of Lif]e Sciences, Tsinghua University, and Li Zhanguo, director of the Rheumatism and Immunity Center at Peking University Peop#le ’ s Hospital, together with their teams discovered the existence o?f human immune globulin can increase the molecul$ar variation of systemic lupus erythematosus susceptibility, and this kind of var|ia|tion is involved in the regulation of immune B cells.
In short, the two teams confirmed that an abnormal immune molecule in the human body i's an import<ant cause of the onset of systemic lupus eryt;hemato;sus.
According to Sun Xiaolin, one of the authors and m(ember o<f Peking University People ’ s Hospital, the team of Li Zhanguo collected nearly 2,000 large samples of patients with systemic lupus erythematosus to make study . It was found that patients with im:mune globulin variations produced pathopoiesis cells and a wide variet[y of numerous autoantibodies . Th`e in-c-iden-ce and seve*rity of nephritis, arthritis, orrhomeningitis va>sculitis and other inflammations are significantly increased.
Through various research methods such as immune cell tracin'g, animal testi;ng, an^d sequencing, Liu Wanli team found that the immune molecule variation activates the immu'ne signaling pathway and the pathogenic mechanism of promoting B cells secr'eting various autoantibodies.
The reporter learned that th]e powerful combination between two teams gave full play t#o their respective advantages and achieved a close integration between basic research and clini-c-al application.
Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immune recognition a^nd immune a+ctivation research, and the Li Zhanguo team has lo<ng been engaged in clinical research on systemi;c lupus erythematosus.
`;` This research i,s one o;f the re!s!ul!ts of years of cooperation between the tw_o teams . It is also the first time in the academic community to recognize that imm.une globulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which lays a solid foundation for further academic research and clinical targeted therapy.

This is n@ot shield mistakes, but a)cting by law.
La+wyers took an axe to the court?
The n{ew{s was really exciting at first glance, and i/t also caused a great disturbance in the lega|l circle.
Fujian Quanzhou Intermediate People ’ s Court subsequently fined the lawyers f{or 500 yuan an(d proposed in writing t;o the Quanzhou Lawyers Association to investigate and handle.
According to the Beijing News, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association issued a formal no(tice that t'he behaviors of the two lawyers did not involve v'i'olations of laws and regulations and were not puni}shed according to law.
According to the multi-party reports, the handling of the Quanzhou Lawyers Associa,tion is not a shortcomings protectio<n or confrontation, but has b+een appro@ve@d by the Quanzhou Intermediate People ’ s Court.
An event that could have caused tension w.ithin the legal commu\nity was eventually resolved properly.
The reversal o~f the even{t stems from the more completed truth restoring: the axe car;ri;ed by the lawyer involved is the same typ>e and same model as the defendant ’ s weapon, but it is not put the first edge . It only serv_es as secondary evidence in the evidence-proven and cross-examination l[ink, and there i}s no threate<ning acts or the subject intention of "endangering the court security".
Judging whether the behaviors of the lawyers involved i_s illeg<al or not, there are four very important details to be concerned . First, the local court has twice held t$he court and only showed a photo of the axe . Fr&om the perspective of defense, it is necessary to show the original axe . Second, the a?xe is purchased one hour before the court ope$n . It is not that the lawyer i*s not willing to seek the judge ’ s consent, but it is not able to contact the j:udge objectively . Th;ird, the axe has not been used in an excessive or improper m.an.ner . Fourth, th\e lawyers admi;tted the mistake in public and immed!iat!ely apologized to the court.
Based on these plots, it c'an be seen t)ha)t t]he lawyers who "took axe to appear in court" have nothing to do the dev<il things, but just to make defense.
After clarifying the whole facts, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association did not foll<ow the societal discussion, b]ut re=sisted the pressure and made a decision not to impose penalties.
And thi)s decision can withstand the test of facts and l!aw!s.
As taking th(e ax`e as the controlled knife to the c+ourt without the permission of the court, it is easy to cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
For the s^ake of safety and cautious, Quanzhou Intermediate People ’ s Court ’ s previous fine punishment a;nd judicial advice are also understand-able.
In order to mai[ntain the di>gnity of lawyers and prevent several courts from finding excuses to purposely make difficulties for lawyers, the S{upreme Law promulgated the "Rules on Security Checks by Judicial Policemen o^f the People ’ s Courts" in 2014, establishing the principles that lawyers do not need to con`du`ct personal security c_heck i<n court.
Since the issuance of the Ru"le, lawyers hav<e set examples, and there have been few incidents endangerin,g the court security happened due to th*e omissions of security checks.
In such a ve>ry rare case happened in Quanzhou, as long as we communicate i!n a spi>rit of mutual respect an!d understanding, misunderstanding is not difficult to eliminate.
As a self-regulatory organization in the lawyer profession, the Lawyers Association bears the dual mission of disciplining against law a!nd safeguard th}e legitimate righ=ts.
In the p;ast, in]divid]ual Lawyers Association organizations have been blame#d for their emphasis on disciplinary action and their loss of safeguard.
The decision of the Quanzhou Lawyer.s Association is worthy of praise both in terms of process a:nd resu<lts, and it sets an exa_mple for more lawyers association to perform their duties correctly.
Which tax benef)its will affect our money bag fr[om October 1?
Xinhua News Agency, S%hanghai, October 1 (reported by Sang Tong)--The Ne:w Individual Income Tax Law will be implemented from Ja^nuary 1, 2019 . I[n order to have the broad masses o*f the people enjoy the benefit*s of tax reduction as so\on as possible, the tax will firstly be dedu"cted from taxpayers' actual job salaries based on the minimum threshold of 5000 yuan per month from October 1, 2019, and the new tax rate schedule will be applie&d.
W"i"th the impleme*n*tatio*n of new policy, which benefits will really affect the people's money bag?
The first benefit: the income tax will be reduc\ed significantl#y in the job salaries.
The taxpayer receiving th=e job salaries after October 1 can have the basic deduction of fees deducted based o-n the threshold of 5000 yua*n per month, and the new tax rate schedule wi>ll be applied . Most of the taxpayers will enjoy different levels of tax reduction, especially the lower and middle-income people, who wil;l see mo]re significant ta*x reduction.
Accor;ding t*o the tax reduction fact sheet of different income groups, for the people whose mon"thly income will be 8000 yuan, 10000 yuan, 20000 yuan, and 50000 yu:an after deducting the `)` three insurances and one fund", the taxable amounts after the tax reform wil|l be 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, and 9090 yuan respectively . Compared wit~h the monthly threshold of 3500 y.uan, the corresponding ta,x reduction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.%0%, 18.8% respectively.
It i$s worth noting that due t}o holidays, the new basic deduction of fees and tax rate schedule can be applied to the salaries that should be paid by t)he units in October but ha_ve been paid at the end of September according t%o laws.
For this purpose, the withholding client software, which is uniformly promote>d and used by the tax department, has provided the corresponding tax calculation fu*nction, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declared and paid durin"g the s|tatutory declaration per^iod.
The second benefit: the gaps between grades of low tax rate's will be obvious:ly widened.
In addition to raising t-he threshold, the new tax rate schedul)e will be applied from October 1.
This time, seven grades o#f tax rates o}f job salaries are the sa!me as before without any changes, b$ut the ga%p%s bet\w\een grades of tax rates are obviously changed . The gaps between three grades of low tax rates in 3%, 10% and 20% a/re obviously widened, the gap of th:e grade of tax rate in 25% is slightly narrowed, but th\e gaps between three grades of high tax rates in 30%, 35% and 45% are t,he same as before.
It is worth noting tha|t the tax law has also adjusted the grades of tax rates for income from production and business operation, and the lower limit of the highest grade of tax rate in 35% ha&s bee>n i"ncr"eased from 0.1 million yuan to 0.5 milli)on yuan.
This means that the individual b\usi\nesses and personal exclusive investment enterprises w>ill benefit from this tax reform.
"From the perspective of measurement and calculation of personal tax red!uc!tion for Sh(anghai taxpayers in the earlier stage, the broad masses of taxpayers wil^l fully experience the benefits of the personal income tax reform, especially the lower and middle#-#income people, who will see m\ore significant tax reduction. `.`
Lan Min, th|e head of Pe\rson\al Income Tax Division of Shanghai Tax Bureau of the State Administration of T$ax$ation, said.
The third benefit: the tax service wil,l become more convenient and opt'imized.
Shanghai tax departments h?av?e carried out a series of comprehensive activities of tax propagan+da since the announcement o?f the new personal income tax law.
On t_he one ha;nd, they provided the policy guidance on "one-to-one & point-to-point" for the impor%tant tax sources and important enterprises.
Pudong New Area Tax Bureau h'a's visited Apple Trading (Shanghai) Co., Ltd., Alipay (C;h;ina) Network Technology Co., Ltd., Red Star Macalline Grou#p Corporation Ltd. and other large enterprises successively . These enterprises ha_ve a large number of employees and a large amount o.f works in withholding and remitting ta'x, so the tax department actively provided coaching and answered questions; Xuhui District T*ax Bureau has visited some large labor service enterprises, including CIIC Financial Consulting Lt}d. a`nd CIIC Shanghai E$con$omic and Tec%hnical Cooperation Ltd. within the district . It collected their concerned proble*ms, responded to their appeals, and resolved their difficulties in a timely way.
On th_e o&ther hand, they implemented the "comprehensive, multidimensional and stereoscopic" tax policy promotion for the citiz}en taxpayers.
They used Shanhai Tax official website, WeChat official account, MicroBlog and other resources t&o post the h;ot topics and ensured that the p$o$li$cy announcements were in place.
At the same time, Shanghai T@ax WeChat official account has p\ut the 12366 Intelligent C=onsultin=g Platform since September 28 . I=t wou)l)d carry out the "targeted" integrated intelligent services of personal income tax reform via the "Human+Intelligence" tax service consultation.

A total of 4 candidates participated in this election, and the voting rate was 63.24%, which wa}s 0.89% lower than tha@t of the Election of Okinawa G*o*ver*no*r i(n 2014.
Tamaki told the media on October 1 that the result of election showed that the Okinawa people didn't want to waste the form+er governor Onaga Takeshi's efforts during h%is lifetime, and he woul_d c/arry ou*t Ta$ke$shi's behests to ma,ke continued efforts in opposing the plan of relocating the US military base and the closure o$f the Futenma base to the Japanese government and the American government.
The Futenma b"a"se is l/ocated in Ginowan in Okinawa Prefecture, and it has been criticized all the time . The Japanese government and the American government have agreed to relocate it to Henoko in Nago, but the O{kinawa p&eople strongly oppose this action and hope to move t[he bas!e completely out of Okinawa.
For the relocation plan strongly o(pposed by Okinawa people and the request to cancel the permit for land reclamation along the coast o)f Henoko, Tamaki said that he didn't stand on the opposite and divisive gro<und agains>t the central government at t+h+e beginning . He hoped th"at both si-des could fully exchange views, show the intention to solve the problems through negotiation.
Japanese President Shinzo Abe also told the media in the morning o<f Octobe<r 1 that he would seriously accept this result and make efforts to revitalize Okinawa a!nd reduc>e the burden on the base.
Yoshihide Suga, the Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan, said in the press conference on October 1 th?a?t the govern>ment's policy of relocating the US ba%s%e as soon a_s possible had not been changed at all.
And he also expressed his intention t=o t?a?lk with Tamaki.
Tam^a^ki will officially take u'p his duties as the governor of Okinawa.
Since the mid-2000s, w=ith Ch_ina ’ s increasing needs for oi:l:seeds, Paul Thomas, a farmer in North Dakota, has grown more an|d more soybeans in his field.
This transi$tion reaches the peak this year . He has grown 1,600 a.cres o;f soybeans in the 5,000-acre land, reaching an unprecedented scale
However, in 2019, Thomas an|d many far|mers like him plan to switch production to the staple crops in the former U.S. agricultural region, such as corn a~nd w^heat.
The area of soybeans grown by American farmers e/xceeds that of co>rn this year, which is for the first time i^n 35 years.
The reason why t=he farmers plan t\o switch production to other crops is that American farmers fa(ce difficulties in selling soyb=eans in the context of the trade war launched by President Trump against China.
China usually purchases around 60% of soybeans exported fr}om America, but because of the t;r;ad;e war, the purchases of American soybeans are nearly zero in recent months, leading to a 10-year lo'w in soyb]ean prices.
Thomas plans to grow mor-e wheats next year and hope{s to earn more by reducing dependence on crops that rely on Chines>e demands.
Thomas said that the soybean price "brings us a h_ea_vy blow '('.
He said that the spot p/ric/e o(f soybeans near hi|s farm was $7.10 per bushel without Chinese demands, while the price needed for c]overing costs was $8.50.
The area of soybeans grown by American farmers hi~ts a high reco<rd and the harvest is expec\ted to hit a high record.
At su}ch a vulnerable tim|e, they are hit by the trade war.
As Trump imposed tariffs on th:e goods imported from China, China imposes tariffs on the soybeans import<ed from America i>n July.
T,he United States Department of Agriculture will release the first estimated report of cultivated area nex%t year, which is expecte^d to include consideration of tariff effects.
This estimate is expected to confirm th?e expectations o$f non-governmental organizations that the cultiva)ted area of soybeans will be reduced.
According to a report seen by Reuters, on October 19, Informa E<conomics predicted that the cultivated area of corns would increase b|y 4% t=o 92.7 million acres (37.5 million hectares) and the cultivated area of soybeans woul*d decrease b^y 7% t:o 83 million acres in 2019.
Info}rma also predicted that the cultivated a`rea of wheats in America would increase by 4%.
T-he cultivated area of soybeans increases to 89.6 million acres this year before retaliatory tariffs are implemented, which is about 15 m&i&llion acres highe#r than that of 1?0 years ago.
The cultivate(d area of corns has increased by less than 5 million acre.s to 89.1 million acres since 2008 . The cultivated area of wheats is 47.8 million acres this ye!ar, which is close t.o the lowest level in 100 year?s.
T)he total cultiva?ted area of the president o*f Illinois Corn Growers Association Aron Carlson ’ s family is 3,600 acr}es . He uses nearly half of th`e land to grow soybeans, but he plans to make reduction in the future.
H/e said that the cultivated area of corns in the farm in North Illinois would increase by 20% at most; this state is the large\st soyb^ean cultivation state in A+merica.
The yields pe;r acre of soybeans are lower than that of corns, but less fertili~zer is needed, which make)s the cost of soybean cultivation relatively low as a wh:ole.
If farmers switch production t=o corns, the cost may increase . But the fertilizer sel;ler of Andersons Inc and other enterprises may benefit from i?t.
Pat Bowe, the CEO of Andersons said to Reuters that he predicted that switchi)ng production to corns would be benefi{cial to fertilizer u$se.
Bayer also predicts to benefit from farmers switching production t,o c]orns.

Xinhua International Commentary: Defend Multilateralism, China Ful>ly Honor It\s Commitments.
Under the circumstance of unilateralism adverse current surging, international rules and mult)ilateral o{rd{er have been impacted.
To so"m"e extent, the confrontation between unilateralism and multilateralism h"as entered into a critical period.
As a responsible great pow<er, C;hina has taken the idea of following the general tendency and corresponding with ma>jor principles and the actio'n with solid and power to ma+intain multilateralism with the international community and promote multilateralism going ahead continuously.
Facing the new situations and new challenges, China has issued a loud voice o:n t"he development direction an&d path of multilateralism.
As Wan^g Yi, State Councilor and Foreign Minist$er, stated at the General Debate of the 73rd Session of the UN General Assembly that multilateralism in the new era should pur#sue th,e goal of win-win cooperation, act upo}n rules and order, uphold fairness and j"usti"ce, and act to deliver real results.
At the same tim@e, Chin@a calls for the establishment o`f a global development cooperation of making the United Nations as the core, North-South cooperation as the main channel and South-Sou%th cooperation as the compl.ement, and calls on all parties to wo"rk together to build a community with shared future for mankind.
China ’ s tho"ugh"t and voice reflect the mainstream o*f the international community.
As the President of the 73rd United Nations General Assembly Espinosa said, under t)he current situation, "the United Natio"ns needs to develop and expand multilateralism and maintain a rules-based internation<al system more tha:n ever".
Lagarde, Presid\ent of International Monetary Fund, said that the international community should continue to firmly uphold the multilateral tr<ading system, adhere to international trade rules, a+nd resolve differences th\ro\ugh consultation.
In recent years, as the changes of global economy and political power balance, some newly-developing markets an~d developing countrie+s h$ave emerged in groups, playing a greater role in the major in*ternational multilateral mechanisms, and providing new development impetus for the multilateralism that h#as suffered from the headwi>nds.
Thinking in this dimension, building a big family but not making up small ci)rcles, adhering t<o discussion and collaboration but not winner-take-all and oth|er the multilateralism ideas advocated by China follow the trend of the t^imes, they are the inevitable choi~ces t%o cope w*i*th global challenges and solve world problems, representing the common pursuit of the majority countries around the world.
Ad&vanced idea with more solid action.
China ’ s "One Bel$t One Road" has become the largest international cooperation pl/at/form.
`/` One Belt One Road", Asian Infrastructure Investment Ban^k, "16+1 Cooperation" and other international an{d regional cooperation initiatives launched by China promote international cooperation, improve existing international systems and order, and b-ring innovation vitality to multila%tera%l cooperation a"nd make contribution to the development of the international order in a mo~re just and rational direction.
As the defender of the international order and t?he practitioner of multilateralism, China ’ s actions are becoming more and more powerful i'n the multilateral sta|ge o{f the United Nations.
Mediate heated-d-iscussi-on international poi^nts, address climate changes, participate in peacekeeping operations, vigorously reduce poverty and help the poor, a}nd help o?ther countries implement the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As United Natio{ns Secretary-General, Guterres said, China has become an i!mpo!rt!ant pillar of multilateralism.
When the "trust deficit" faced b&y the w.orld intensifies, when Populism and polarization trends are o(n the rise, it is the most urgent moment th\a\t the world needs multilateral cooperation.
At such a histo(r(ical juncture, the international c!ommunity needs to join hands to turn consensus into actions, resolutely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the building of community with sh=are=d futu&r&e for mankind.

The fifth "Month of vocalization for the disabled" come<s; focus on the issue of s^e^x education for disabled teenage;r;s - China News
In recent years, the topic of se!x educa#tio#n for Chinese teenagers has been widely discus?sed, but the challenge for sex education for disabled teenagers is still arduous.
Recently, the seminar on challenges a:n:d practical strategies of comprehensive sex education for the d?isabl?ed was held i#n Beijing.
It is an major issue about how to ca`rry out sex education for disabled children and yo%ung peop"le in this seminar.
"The report of sexual knowledge, attitudes and behaviors of Chinese disabled children and young people" released at the meeting r~eveals that the proportion of disabled children subjected to s_ex_ual harassment a&n&d abuse is higher than that of h;ealt;hy ch~ildr~en.
For disabled children and teenagers, what the society focuses on i)s the attention of `*` sexual protection".
This semi[nar aims at promoting the comprehensive sex education for disabled children and teenage~rs in China from three aspects o*f family suppo=rt, school education and institution services, providing support to the disabled children and teenagers from the source, thu?s letting them enjoy the right of lo[ve as others do.
Experts believe that the Chinese public understanding o,f disabled groups has remained at a level that is no#t deep enoug#h for a long time.
Being influenced by the traditional concept and o:ther factor-s, the comprehensive sex e{ducation for th\e disabled, especially for the disabled children and teenagers in China, is not deep enough.
However, in recent years, with th{e support of th@e UNESCO and public-spirited people, the practice and implementation path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education for the disabled in China h_av_e ma?de gratifying progress.
"The report" shows t:hat the children and young people with visual impairment, hearing impairment, intellectual impairment and physical impairment have more difficulties in acquiring sexual knowledge and understanding intim?ate relationship than the ordinary people, but th<ey h#a#v#e generally d$eveloped towards convenience and enrichment.
"The seminar on challenges and practi;ca;l strategies of comprehensive sex education for the disabled" is held by the Shanghai Youren Public Welf$are Fou&ndation and supported by the UNESCO Representative Office in China, t^he Beijing Representative Office of the I`nternationa`l League for Disabled Persons (France) and the UNFPA Representative Office in China . I*ts purpose is to explore the practice and implementation path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual and reproductive health education for the disabled in the context of grand s[trategy of h>ealthy China, and promote the interested par]ties of pol+icy makers, educato(rs, researchers, s)ocial service organizations and parents ’ representatives in the field of special education a\nd integrated education to understand th=e international policy on comprehensive sexual education and the right to health of disabled children and young people; t`he practices, strategies, challenges and res)o)urces of sex education for disabled children and young people in China are widely exchange}d, and the wa(y of c<o<mpreh<ensive sex education for disabled children and young people in the future is discussed and a blueprint is set up to fo'rm a support network.
Report of the Reuters o!n September 30 in Beijing - People '.s Bank Of China releas`ed its predetermined short-term n>et outflow of foreign currency assets on Sunday and showed as of the end of August this y^ear, its short positions in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies remained zero for 12 c#onsecutive mo"nths, and there were still no long position in that month.
Previous data from the People's Bank Of China showed that as of the end of August last ye.ar, the i@t had a total short position of $6.044 billion in forward and fut(ures contracts for foreign curr@encies vs local currencies, unchanged for the fourth conse[cutive month; t`he short position in SDR (Special Drawing Rights) was 4&.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the foreign exc:hange for\wards short position of the People's Bank Of China remained zero.
People's Bank Of China release%d the data for th)e first time at the en,d o/f March 2016; the data showed that at t)he end of February 2016, its long positions in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies vs local currencies was US $2.438 bi{llion and short positions was US $28.9 billion.
The d+ata in September released at the end o%f October of the same year showed a ne)t short position increase of $16.401 billion to $45.301 billion for the firs|t time.
People's Bank Of China has previously said that the forw/ard and futures short posit,ions of foreign currencies vs local currencies mainly reflected t}he forward operations o*f foreign exchang*e carr[ied out by the People's Bank Of China with commercial banks with t[he purpose of meeting the hedging needs of enterprises' foreign currency liabilities . It would continue to provide forward hedging products according t)o the principle of actual demand, a|nd the forward operations of the People's Bank Of China would have minor i{m{pact on the scale of future foreign exchange reserves.
O,n the evening of September 20 this year, on the K158 train, student Q,iao, who was a junior in Zhengzhou, too"k the train to Hebi.
An elder uncle on the train bought a t`ick`et without seat, but he took up her seat, and sa&id: "you c,a,n tak[e photos, whatever".
Du+ring the two hours of driving, the train conductor ad^vised him for an hour, however it stil?l had no results.
In the e|nd, a ma-le passenger in the same carriage could not sta>nd up and pulled up the elder uncle.
Fro}m th$e public opi=n=ion, although the f'in'al result is mostly th:at th}e persons wh!o forcibly occupy seats are condemned by the public, administratively punished by the public security department, and even included in the blacklist of integrity, the public still feels that it does not "vent their hates": Why can ’ t the persons who forcib]ly occupy seats be punished on the spot?
Wh-y can ’ t stop immoral or even illegal behavior on th`e spot, but can only punish it aft]erwards?
And for the unre)aso)nabl)e behavior o:f "the elder uncle who forcibly occupy seats", why only a male passenger pull him up b?ecause of "Road see i=njustice"?
T{h{e main reason i}s that only long-distance trains are equipped with railway policemen, and there is generally no railway policemen for short-distance trains; even if there is railway policemen, the passengers are more concerned a?b?o?u?t the possible rogue reactions of t#he persons who forcibly o{ccupy se;ats and do not take compulsory taking away measures.
Repeated seats forcibly occupied events have made people rea~li~ze that it is necessary to let the persons who forcibly o[ccupy seats be forced to take aw>ay or even be punished on the s{po{t.
This requires that our railway policemen should dare to take powe_rful measures in a timely manner . Trains that do not have policemen should m=ake deployment as soo+n as possible to preserve and p're'vent illegal a`ctivitie`s in a timely manner.
It is t(he first da"y of the National Day holiday in October 1 . There is a surge i/n th-e vehicles heading for Mao County and Songpan County via Beichuan Qiang Minority Autonomous County in Sichuan.
Beichuan Traffic Police received a c@all for help at about 13:00 saying that a family member had a traffic accident in Songpan and was badly in nee{d of being sen=t to Mianyang for treatment due to the limited l=ocal med"ical conditions.
However, the Huanhu Road of T@an@gjia@shan quake lake in Beichuan was under one-way traffic control, so the caller hoped the traffic police would permit the 120 emergency ambul,ance to pas@s though th*e road.
A~fter getting the call for help, th]e policeman on duty quickly reported this to the traffic police group . Aft{er understanding the general situation, the group leader Huang Xuemin immedia&tely arranged the policemen on duty at the controlled site to contact wi.th the help seeker and asked them to d?o the escort job well.
"There were more than 1000 ve`hicles having entered t+he controlled ro!ad seg:men:t at that time . After contacting with the 120 emergency ambulance, we estimated that it would arrive at Beichuan a\t about 15:00, so we implemented the arrangement and deployment immediately. "
T;he leader of Yuli Squadron of Beichuan Traffic Police D{a Wei introduced that the emergency ambulance ne|ed|ed to by`pass the Huanhu Road of Tangjiashan quake lak{e, and the road was steep and narrow . I\n order to prevent the vehicles in th[e road segment fro}m running side b+y side, the traffic police implemented the subsection control of vehicles in th&e beginning, the middle and the end of the road an hour in advance and reminded all drivers passing through it to make a way for the emergency ambulance.
Later, the p/olicemen of Leigu Squadron also stopped the vehicles entering the controlled road segment temporarily, and asked the vehicles to form a l&ine to make a way for the incomi>ng 120 e-mer-gen-cy ambulance.
An emergency ambulance with a "Chuan U" license plate was driving into Beichuan at about 15}:00, and Beichuan Traffic Polic[e sent a police c>ar to clear the way and escort the eme@rgenc@y ambulance into the cont.rolled road segment by driving against the traffic.
It was learned that s"om"e places on Hua[nhu Road only permitted o'n'e vehicle passing through, and the police implemented the temporary control at th;ese places so that the 120 emergency ambulance could successfully pass through.
It was impossible to give way in a ro%ad segment in Shilibei Village in Daxuan_ping Town, s{o th*e traffic police got in touch with the village party branch and village committee in advance to u&se the village road for bypassing and stop the social vehicles from entering.
"It only took 40 minutes from Beichuan Traffic Police met the 120 emergency ambulance to drive into the norma$l road of t}he 302 provincial highway. `^`
Da W{ei explained that the overall passing time needed to be 4 h&ours under normal circumstances.
"This arrangement has successfully s|aved precious treatment time for the patient. `%`
It was l@earne@d that the critically ill pa:tient was timely sent to Mianyang for treatment at 17:20.
The number of confirmed deaths caus"ed by t=he earthquake and tsunami in Indon{esia has risen rapidly to 832 . Authoritie{s are worried that th!e number will rise, as rescue workers find it difficult to provide assistance to remote areas that have lost contact.
Wh-at is particularly worrying is Donggala, the regio;n north of Palu with a population of 300,000, which is close to the epicenter o`f this earthquake.
Othe%r two regions have lost contact with t&he outside world since Friday.

Indonesian Vice-President Kalla said that the n#umber of deaths might rise to thous(ands.
Indonesian President Jok_o Widodo have investigated the disaster areas an_d appealed the public for patience in earlier time.
Report of Reuters o?n November 4: T/he English Daily Teleg\raph reported on Sunday that Dominic Raab, the Brexit Secretary, privately required Britain to br[e[ak away from the right arranged b,y the "guarantee" of Irish border in three months.
It was reported that Raab made this re[q[uest to S)i)mon Coveney, the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Trade Minist)er of Ireland, at a private me`eting in London last Tuesday.
The report pointed out t~hat this request was "obviously contradictory '@' to the statement made by David Lidington, the British Cabinet Office Secretary, during his vis"it to D$ubli$n three days later.

Report from our correspondent (intern reporter, L.i Qiyao): In recent years, the events of unqualified campus plastic runway ha/ve occur;red in many regions.
Therefore, the Ministry of Education issues a notice that requires the s&p&ort fields with surfaces made of s&ynthetic materials for primary and sec\ondary schools to implement the new national standard before delivery f}or use after November 1.
Th<e mandatory national standard "The sport fields with surfaces made of synthetic materials for primar^y and secondary schools" is led by the Ministry o>f Education . 26 research institutes and te`st`ing organizations have participated in drafting the standard and it have gone through more than two years of revision . During tha|t time, more than 10)0 meetings o^f expert argument were held, a=nd the nationwide field studies and sampling inspections were implemented . Countless validation experiments have been colle&cted from products o^f hundreds of enterprises on the market.
The reporter contrasts t@he old national standard in 2005 and finds that the new national standard has not only changed from the "national recommended standard" to the "national mandatory standard", but also added a lot of content, including thickness requirements, physical properties, aging res^ista^nce, re+qu+ireme+nts for inorganic filler content, requirements fo$r anti-slip coll!oidal p\art\icle polymer content, limits of harmful substances of surface finished pro?ducts, li<m<its of harmful substances o?f non-solid and solid materials, etc.
I]n particular, the ne\w n]ation]al standard l;imits the harmf}ul substances that may be produced in the construction process of campus plastic runway, increasing from 7 to 18 items, and stipulates the limits of volatile organic compounds i,n the built runway according to the standard of home decoration.
For example, the release amount of harmful substances i}s sp~ec~i~fied in the "Limits of cast-in-situ and prefabricated surface finished products an|d odor requirements", which requires that the total volatile organic compounds should not exceed 5 mg/cubic meter, formaldehyde should no^t e<x<ceed 0.4 mg/cubic meter, carbon disulfide should not exc'eed 7 mg/cubic meter, benz<ene should not exceed 0.1 mg/cubic meter, an^d the odor grade should not be higher than Grade 3.
The new nat^ional standard also stipulates in detail the sampling requirements, inspect>ion rules and judgment rules of plastic run*way*s of primary and secondary schools.
I_n addition, the campus artificial lawn has also been in#cluded in the mandatory testing scope of the national standa%rd for the first time.
In the near futur/e, special work plans will be carried out for the implementation situa&tion of the new national standard all over the country, and the implementation o.f the ne)w n]ational standard should be submitted to the Depar]tment of Sports Hygiene and Arts Education of the Ministry of Education within the year.
ECN^S Client, Chengd!u, September 3]0 (reported by Wang Yu) -{- There was an "internal battle within t&h&e Chinese table tennis team" at the 2018 ITTF Women's World Cup finals in the afternoon on September 30.
Ding Ning, the Grand Slam winner, finally secured an impr%ess%ive 4=-0 victory ov|e|r her teammate Zhu Yuling, who was the host, and won the golden medal again in the ITTF Wom}en's World Cup after four years . This was also the 21s\t time for the Chinese table tennis team to w)in the championship in the ITTF W!omen's World Cup.
Ding Ning and Zhu Yu.ling are tea}mmates and friends, so they are very familiar with each ot_he_r's technique and tactics.
Regardless of p_repa_r_ing for the gam\e or warming up before the game, they are very closel)y associated with each other.
Aft!er entering the finals, both of them invari&ably expressed that they had fulfilled their competition duties.
However, t]he contest between Ding Ning an%d Zhu Yuling can be called as a hot battle.
I$n the fi}rst set, due to her rich experience of competition, Ding N*ing started in the ascenda#nt and was 3-0 ahead . Then, Zhu Yuling to-ok advantage of the mistakes made by Ding Ning and tied it at 3.
Su_bsequently, Zhu Yuling made increasing mistakes in attac_k, while Ding Ning seized t?hi?s opportunity to get 3 points i/n a row with a 9-5 lead, and was the first to get the game point at 10-6.
Although Zhu Yuling got 3 points straightly, Di?ng Ning took t]he opportunity o%f serving to win 11-9 in the first set.
In the second set, Z:hu Yuling s\till made a lot of mistakes, while Ding Ning made good use of the adv(ant(age of being locked in a stalemate and held a safe l(ea(d at 6-1.
Despite being 2-7 behind, Zh;u Yuling got 2 points straig[htl[y by changing her pace, and then narrowed the gap to 8-9 for a time by tak>in>g adva,ntage of attacking.
At this crucial moment, Ding Ni:ng go;t 2 points stra(ightly and won again in the second set at 11-8.
Ea=rly in the third set, their scores were rather close res.ul.ting in a draw at 3-3.
Then, D;ing Ning made increasing mistakes i,n attack and lost 3 points in a row . How>ever, she got 3 points strai+ghtly in sharp attack to find an equalizer at 6-6.
Zhu Yuling got 2 points straightly to buil>d h'er advantage again, and w~as the first to get the game point at 10-8.
However, Ding Ning played so h)a)rd and so aggressive, and won the third s;et at 12-10 after getting 4 points in a r{ow.
In the fourth set, Zhu Yuling made a g)ood start and was 4-"2 ahead.
However, Ding N#ing showed her ultra strong attacking p&ower soon afterward and got 4 points in a ro{w forcing Zhu Yuling to call a timeout.
After the timeout, Zhu Yuling boun&ced back a bit and gradually tied th(e score at 8-8.
At this critical moment, Di|ng Ning had no mercy an<d got 2 p+oints straightly to reach the match point.
As Zh;u Yuling returned the ball out o"f bounds, Ding Ning won 4-0 over her r-ival to take the crown.
Last month, Din,g Ning was crowned the winner of the Bulgaria Open and ended her 14-mont"h troph=y drought . Although she expressed before the game that she hadn't set any g%oal%s f*or this game in Chengdu, she revealed after the semi-finals in t<he morning that she had fulfilled her duties.
Finally, Ding Ning defeated her teammate Zhu Yuling to win the thir`d World C{up c.hampion of her own . She was satisfied with her performance: "The champion is very important t&o every athlete.
I haven't thought o-f winning the champion before the game . I just want to try m/y bes-t in each gam_e . I'm very satisfied with my performance in the finals. "
As th[e host, Sichuan girl Zhu Yuling won a silver medal, fai`ling to complete the goa<l of defending . When talking about whether the enthusiastic h=ome crowd would pose invisible pressure on her, she said: "I feel that I'm doing well i\n dealing with pressure in th}e whole game . Ding Ning is playing very w&el&l today, but I have n'%t found my pace. "
For activating r%ural consumption, it is necessary to rely on the normalization mechanism to purify the market, guid!e the demand for healthy consumptio+n, and enhance the sense of gain in farmers ’ consumpt=ion.
According to data, th,e consumption potentiality of rura#l residents has been continuously released . I/n the first h-alf of this year, the retail sales of rural consumer goods increased by 10.5%, and the growth rate is 1.3 percen'tage points higher than that of towns.
During t*he visit to a poor village in a western county, there is only one convenience store in the whole village . Stepping into the stor$e, s*ome items are the brands we familiar with, however there a{re lots of fake good, such a/s "金龙鱼 '%' is labeled as "金龙]油" and "旺仔" labeled as "旺奶".
Over the year]s, similar phenomena h|ave been frequently exposed . So|me rural fak>e and inferior products imitate famous brands, they have similar na/mes and packages to mix the false with the genuine, which is really hard to prevent.
A consumer survey r!eport released by a city in the west shows that rural shopping malls and supermarkets hav'e a seriou$s problem of fake products, and 66% of us!ers have bought fakes in supermarkets in vill:ages and towns offline, of which food accounts fo}r more than half.
The relevant departments claim to rectify the rural markets every yea-r, while, w.hy t@h@e phenomena of fake products still occur repeatedly?
Differen_t from the urban markets, farmers ’ awareness of rights protection is relatively weak, and many villag#es are in remote locations within the blin!d areas of inspection force can ’ t reach, so tha]t the fake and infe,rior goods have a breeding ground.
O$ne produc>t has more than one regulatory departments, some are responsible for price, so]me are for production, and others are fo(r markets, so the functions are overlapped . Strong measures against fake and inferior products have been t.aken every year, h?owever the central management c|a|n onl^y last for a period of time . On one hand, the fakes escape the crack down trend and slo:wl:y emerged, on the other h|and, the previous fakes just have been dealt and the new fake came out.
Some unscrupulous traders have initiated the idea o[f "going to the m`oun`tainous areas and the countryside" and some rural areas become the "waste eli?mination markets", both of these problems are beca.use of long-term supervision mechanism, difficulties in purifying rur]al markets, low illegal cost an=d higher profit.
From food and clothing to well-off, the maj^ority o$f farmers are moving towards development type consumption.
A few days ago, the Party Centra+l Committee and the State Coun(cil issued the "Some Opinions concerning Stimulating the Consumption Mechanism to Further Encourag@e the Consumption Potential of Residents", which proposed t\o promo=te the level upgrading of the consumption of rural residents . The p<urpos<e is to make the majori'ty of farmers t[o "have ability to consume", "have willing to consume" and "dare to consume" to let the rural consumption real[ly flourish.
O!n the one hand, we mu^st deepen reforms, eliminate drawbacks of market management polic&i&e&s coming f=rom multiple departments a:nd regulate by more than one departments . According to local conditions, improve the food safety, product quality supe?rvision network, and constantly reduce the space for rural fake products manufacturing and selling.
On the other hand, it is necessary to intensify law enforcement and open u"p t_he supervision of each department, and never allow the fake and inferior commodities t'o bre@ed in the countryside.
It is the protection for farmers to se_verely punish the behavior of entrapping farmers . No matter how concealed t%he counterfeiters hide, it should n?ot be the reason for the breeding of the fake and inferior commodities . Relevant departments should clarify their responsibil$i$ties, and th+e grassroots supervisory powers should go down . If there is a pr~oblem in any part, i.t is necessary t)o investigate the responsib{i{lity and let the counterfeiters and selling persons have nowhere to hide.
Strictly control the market access, implement strict qualification examinations for produc\tion operators . Keep the mark?et circulation, let the products have clear sources and out&let markets . Think of w]ays from the source and th)e roots, let the legal dealers operate with peace of mind, and let the farmers buy wi<th confidence.
Activate rural consumption, guide the dem`and f&or healthy consumption.
As consumption upgrading, many fa$rmers not only pursue of well fed and eat well, but a@lso go after for high quality life with culture and healthy . Thus, rural markets are not equal to "low qua=lity" and "low pr|ice '#'.
This needs to promote the extension of e-commerce to the vast rural areas, connect the urban a|nd rural two-way linkage sales c|han|nels, promote the combination of offline industry development platform and onli{n{e e-commerce trading platform, support the new forms a[nd new modes of consum"ption to expand into the rural market; promote qualified villages a<nd towns to combine trade logistics w|it|h leisure agriculture, rural tourism, and product processing dynamically; improve t]he rural modern circulati-o-n network system, op]tim]i]ze the integration of stock facilities resources, and effectively reduce rural circulation costs.
Create a clear an/d reassuring market environment for the rural a[reas, so that farm?ers can affo*rd to buy, so that the rural consumption can become more and more prosperous and the farmers ’ senses of ga|in and happiness can be enhanced.
Our country will reduce the MFN tariff rat;e for some goods from November 1, and the general tariff level wil;l be reduced to 7!.5%.
Accor#ding to t*he decision of the 26th executive meeting of the State Council, the Tariff Commission o#f the S/tate Council announced on September 30 that the MFN tar@iff rate for some goods would be reduced from November 1, 2018.
Accordin}g to the "Tariff Commission o+f the Stat`e Council's Announcement o/n Reducing the Import Tariff for Some Goods", the MFN tariff rate for some goods, including the industrial goods, would be reduced from November 1, 201(8 in order to adapt t!o the industrial upgrading, reduce the enterprise costs, and satisfy people's demands of multilevel co*nsumption.
There were 1585 taxable items in total for th>e tax reduction goods, w?hich accounted for abo[ut 19% of total taxable items in our country . The average tax rate was reduced from 10.5% to 7.8% by a:n ave+rage of 26%.
This tax reduction ma_inly involved the textiles; stones, ceramics, glass products; some steel and base metal products; electromechanical d_evices and parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile machinery, engineering machi!nery, electric transmission an-d tr_ansformation equipment, electrical appliances, instruments and apparatus, etc .; resource goods a{nd primary processed goods, su@c@h a#s non-metal ores, inorganic chemicals, wood and paper prod@ucts, gemstone and jade, etc.
Meanwhile, with the reduction of general tariff level, especially the import tariff reduction of medicine and consumer go&ods, the taxable items and tax rate for i;mport tax o=n imported goods would be r>e>duced accordingly.
In order t\o implement the decisions and deployments o~f t:he Party Central Committee an+d the State Council, our country had implemented the zero tariff on most imported drugs since May 1 this year, had reduced the import tari-ff for automobiles and p}art}s an@d some consumer goods since July 1, an)d had implemented the third step of tax reduction for products in the extended scope of Information Technology Agreement.

The gross domestic product (GDP) o>f Canada grew by 0.`2% in July co"mpared with the p`revious month, with a higher-than-expected growing rate, raising market expectations that the Bank o&f Canada will raise interest rates next month.
If it does, it will be the fifth time in a b}i}t more than a ye(ar that the bank raises interest r"ates.
The analysts o$f Reuters who made a>n interview previously forecasted a 0.1% increase.
The Statistics Canada sa/id o[n Friday that 12 of the 20 industries had achieved growth.
The data is noteworthy for the reason that the Bank of C(anad(a predicted earlier this month that temporary fact]ors could drag down the third-quarter GD@P data.
Poloz, the presid<e<nt of the Bank of Canada, promised on Thursday that th~e ba!nk would continue to gradually raise intere*st rates and pay close attention to the economic data.
The Bank of Canada will a%nnou%n%ce its next interest rate de'cision on October 24.
The Bank of Canada has r^a^ised interest rates four times since July 2017 as the Cana}dian economy has strengthened and the unemployment rate is close to record l:ows.
Stephen Brown, the senior Canadian economist at Capital Economics, said that the country '*s third-quarter G%DP was expected t:o grow at an annualized rate o'f around 2%.
"Th~is will be 1.5% higher than the expectation of the Bank of Canada, which will b%e another reason to expect the Bank o*f Canada to ra,ise interest rates next mon(t(h," he said in a report.
Overni(ght index swaps show that the market forecasts for probability of risings of in*terest rate of the Bank of Can~ada in October rise from 76.46% to 78.27%.

According to the militar+y agreement signed by South Korea and North Korea in Sept(ember, vessels of bot'h side]s only need to inform the other side in advance before sailing in common waters in the future.
Report on November 5 of Chin~a News: the website of the Chinese em<b<a<ssy in Mongolia reported on November 5 that Ch^inese citizens Guo Yu]qin and Mao Runxin had been missing when traveling in Mongolia,.
It was understood that th@ese two people were members of the Bl^ue Sky Rescue team . On October 19, they contacted their relatives and friends in China and said they would immediately explore the mountains nea\r the Kh(ov(sg(ol Lake . They shared their location via WeChat and then went miss{ing . It was su$specte$d that they had headed for the n]o man's land.
The Chinese embassy in Mongolia alwa[ys paid high attention to the protection of the lawful rights and interests and safety of Chinese citizens in Mongolia, as wel}l as the consular protectio+n a|nd assistance.
After being informed of the information about the two tourists going missing, the e@mbassy immediately activated the contingency pl|an for consular p&r&otection, strived t=o seize the prime time for rescue and spared no efforts to work.
The embassy maintained close communication with th?e two tourists' families, assisted them in immediately repor"ting the case to th%e Mongolian police, and provided them with a list of interpreters for their choi.ce.
T"he embassy made an appointment with the heads of the Mongolian Foreign Relations Department, the General Bur_eau of Police a@nd the General Bureau of E%mergency at first time to repo[rt relevant information . The embassy requested the Mongolian side to carry out the search a#nd rescue operation as soon a#s possible and maintained close communication with the Mongolian side during the search an/d rescue process to ensure to keep up the latest progress.
Meanwhile, the embassy assisted the family members in publishing the notice for missin)g p)ersons in Mongolia, a*nd extensively mobi'liz'ed overseas Chinese and Chi,nese-f,unded enterprises in Mongolia to actively participate in searching the missing persons, provide effecti>ve clues . The embassy als~o provided relevant assistance to the members of the Blue Sky Rescue team who went to Mongolia for assistance.
Under th#e strong boost of the embassy, the Mongolian si]de immediately sent a rescue team and promised to exempt the search and res+cue costs.
The General Bureau of Police an]d the General B%ureau of Emergency of Mongolia instructe|d the police and emergendy department of Hovsgol province to spare no efforts to search and rescue the missing perso{n{s.
Since Khovsgol Lake was located at the border of north of Mongolia and Russia, its location was in remote, and it was a vast territory wi\th a sparse population of which t<ran<sportatio<n and communica(tion was extremely i$nconvenient . Meanwhile, Mongolia has currently entered the win@ter, and the temperature was as low as aro^und -20 degrees . T.he local police and emergency department overcame great difficulties, almost to mobilize all for\ces and stimulate the local herdsmen to carry out the carpet search and rescue operation around the w%ide range of the position where two people lost f}or days on end through th+e wa>ys of horse riding, walking, and visiting the herdsmen.
Meanwhile, in view of special conditions in the pastoral areas, the Mongolia side has been c?ircularly publishing the notice of missing persons through t-he radio fo+r days.
Relevant staff of Chinese Blue Sky Rescue team have also com;e to Mongolia to actively participate in t@he r/escue work together with the Mongolian side.
The safety o{f the two missing persons has al|ways affected our hearts.
To date, the two people have been lost for mor`e than 10 days . The embassy successively rece?ived some clues, but st:i:ll cannot find them . The search and res[cue operation was still under way.
The embassy would always follow the principle of "people first", sustain attention t!o t,his matter, push the Mongolian side to continue the all-out search a`nd resc?ue operation and provide maximum assistance to the two persons' fam,ilies.
The embassy appe[als to the compatriots and enterprises i&n Mongolia to contact t^he Chinese embassy in Mongolia at first time for any relevant clues.
