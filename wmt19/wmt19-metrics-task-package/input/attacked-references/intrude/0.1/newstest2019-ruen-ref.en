Elon Musk was forced to leave his post as chairman of the board of d+irectors of Tes<la
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and T~e~sla fo\under Elon M>usk settled their dispute over a fraud case.
CNBC News reports on t}his.
The TV n%etwork reports tha$t under the agreement reached, Musk must l,eave his post as chairman of Tesla ’ s board of directors.
T-h-e SEC allowed Musk to still retain his p+ost as chief executive of Tesla.
The Tesla founder must also pay an administra/ti/ve fine in the amoun,t of $20 million.
The same amount will al&so be collected from Tesla.
T@h@e money will be di(stribu(ted among investors who were harmed.
In addition, the company mus[t appoint two in!depend!en!t directors.
Elon Musk is a?n American entrepreneur on the l(ist of the 50 w}ealthiest people on the planet according to Forbes magazine.
He is the head of t>he space company Sp;aceX, the neurotechnology company Neuralink, and c[r[eator of the electric-car company Tesla, as well as founder of Paypal.
The SEC previously brought a case against Tesla chief ex>ecu>t>i>ve El{o{n Musk for his announcement po/sted on Twitter of a possible buyout of the company.
L|a|st mon^th Musk announced plans to make Tesla a private company and to buy out all its shares on the stock exchange a;t a fixed price of $420.
The $420 share price was supposedl,y set “ due to the significance of this number in marijuana culture, ” th=e Bloomberg news agency earlier reported wi|th a quote by Steven Peikin, Co-D:irector o"f the SEC ’ s security department.
Elon Mus(k consequently dropped his plans to buy up th`e shares.
Commenting on the court case bro.ught against him by the SEC, the businessman s:tat:e:d that h)e considers the allegations of fraud unfounded, and added that he is very disappointed and sa{ddene{d by these claims.
“ Honesty is the most important value i"n my life, and the fact.s will prove that I didn ’ t violat{e it at all, ” said the businessman in an intervi`ew with CNBC.
Mea@nw@hile in August a group of Tesla sh]areholders broug=ht a class-action lawsuit against Musk complaining of financial losses that they had incurred.
The plaintiffs a/ss/erted that Musk ’ s posts resulted i"n losses for them.
In particular, on[e of the shareholders stated that the tweets from Musk led to mistake?s whereby sellers of Tesla shares were f;or;c;e;d to purchase securities at artificially high prices in or}der to cover their positions.
Other pl}ainti}ffs also pointed out that careless statements by Elon Musk caused sharp fluctuations in the sh`are price.
In September Musk was accused o#f market manipulation also b-y the head of Citron Research.
Meanwhile, if Mu"sk hadn ’ t be}en able t%o settle his case with the SEC, he could ha;ve faced removal from the company ’ s management and even prison.
Former SEC Chairman Harvey P[itt told CNBC about this.
Mus%k is “ n`ot a bad guy, but he ’ s n}ot capable of managing a car company . ”

On September 3|0, 1928, i.e., exactly 90 y<ears ago, the British bacteriologist Al<e<xa<n<de<r Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
The discovery of penicillin marked t&he beginning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame and mad\e him the No#bel laureate.
By the w.ay, t|he isolation of penicillin from mold fungi was not the first discovery of Fleming.
A few y_ea_rs earlier, when he had a cold, he placed mucus from his own n;ose on a Petri dish (th^is i.s a kind of a glass dish in which experiments are conducted with bacteria) and a few da|ys later he discovered that the bacteria t&hat was there had been destroyed.
Penicillin wa;s also discovered by chance in almost the same w}a}y.
F;leming's name was added to the list of t\he 100 most prominent personalities in human history.
His discove*ry, according to many scholars, ch[anged the course of history.
With the help of pe%nicillin, medicine be:gan to be-at the most longstanding diseases previously considered incurable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gangrene ...
When, shortly after receiving the Nobel Prize, in 1#945, Fleming arrived in the French capital, Paris newspapers w?rote: “ H$e did more than dozens of divisions to defeat fascism and liberate Fran|ce".
Accordi)ng to experts, Fl{emi{ng ’ s discovery of the world's first antibiotic ha?s saved the lives of more than 200 million people on Earth.
Alexander Fleming d'ied in his home in London in 195^5 from a heart attack.
He was cremated, and a week later his ashes wer.e buried in the fam+ous London Cathedral of S`t. Paul.
Whe're, by the way, a talkative Russian-speaking guide drew th:e attention of me and my wife t<o it.
And a few ye=ars later, we ha,d a chance to see Alexander Fleming's full size statue i=n the most unexpected place for this in the capital of Spa#in.
There, near t+he main bullfighting arena Plaza de Toros de Las Venta[s, t<he famous Spanish matad=or=s erected a monument to a ma(n, whose efforts, in their opinion, saved the lives of hundreds of eminent bullfighters.
By the way, I found this very interesting, in m'y opinion, porcelain wo!rk a)t the s,am,e place, in Madrid, but at another time and for a completely different reason.

Trump spoke of “ bein-g i:n love ” with Kim Jong-un
While earlier they had bullied each other, the leaders of the U@S and North Korea have practically fal&len i)n love, joked Donald Trump.
US President Donald Trump reported a well-executed joke ab,out their successes in resolving the North Korea cri*sis.
After starting with mutual thr{ea{ts of annihilation, no#w the lea\ders of the t;wo countries have smoothed out their relations so well that they are virtually in love with each other, the American President remarked.
The man i|n the White House mentioned that he had taken on the North Korea problem from the previous administration as th;e most difficult problem in foreign p\oli\cy.
Trump notes that Bar$ack Obama ’ s te;am had so neglected relations wit[h Nort}h Korea that it couldn ’ t even reach the country ’ s leadership by phone — the other side basically didn ’ t p(ick up the receiver.
The)n the US and North Korea were on t?he verge of war, but t?oday the North Korean leader is writing “ beautiful lette/rs ” to the White House, said Trump.
Trump admi:tted that he had been “ nasty ” to Kim Jong-un, which, by th#e way, was mutu.al.
But now their relations have been smoothed out to the point that t%he leaders “ have fallen i]n love w`ith each other . ”
Trump meanwhile asked p#eople not to take his words literally and warned that American media wil&l interpret hi*s statements as incompetence.
Trump pointed out that recently P(yongyang had stopped its nuclear and mis/sile tests, and is closing military bases.
The American president i[s sure t/hat all of this is the achievement of his administration.
Last Tuesday Donald Trump spoke flatteringly of Kim Jon,g-un at a meeting of the UN ’ s General Assembl#y.
Trump thanked the North Korean leader for his bravery a<nd for the steps he has ta.ken to de-escalate tensions.
Trump also noted that sanctions against Nort/h Kor<ea ar:e being kept in place until the moment of full denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.

A,t t.he end of the negotiations, the two sides expressed the intention to move in the direction of a peaceful re$solution of the conflict, whi{l{e not taking on any legal obligations.
Positive results from the meeting were the s'uspension of nuclear and missile tests by North Korea, as well as t^he re~turn to the US o=f the remains of American soldiers from that country.
At the same time, no other practical steps toward the denucle>ariza>t>ion of North Korea ar|e being taken.
News media have repor^ted th:at after the Singapore summit, the U*S sent several scenarios for disarmament to North Korea, but Pyongyang rejected them, calling them “ gangster-l@ike . ”

Nitsoi called fo*r replacing `{` Moscow language with a Ukrainian product"
Ukrainia<n chil]dren's author and advocate for the purity of her native language, Larisa Nitsoi cal>led for relieving Ukraine from the "Russian-language Moscow product and Moscow lan&gu&age."
To do this, sh@e proposes as th&e Ukrainian pr\odu\ct - "a cultural wave, a cultural onslaught."
Nitsoi shared her thoughts on "the feasibilit-y of eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" w>ith t'he Ukrainian publication "Observer".
In her words, the ri@ght Ukrainian product is ready now - it already exists and wil-l conti<nue to be developed.
With time, Ukrainians will `#` recover" from this "Moscow language", sh+e asserted.
Fo\r example, in neighboring Polan.d, in her words, Russian speech was widespread on television and rad-io, but it was practically absent in the public arena.
In this regard, in Nitsoi's opinion, Ukrainians are not using ag'gressive methods in this process: actions by authorities to prohibit the use of t'he Russian language, i`n her opinion, merely "expand the boundaries f@or Ukrainian speech at a l}egal level."
Previously, Nitsoi shared her expe,rience s'upporting a "Ukrainian language regime" at a children's camp in the Carpathians, where she w]as invited to work.
In December 2016 she threatened to s)ue the Watsons bookstore chain, on'e of whose cashiers spok_e to her in Russian.
Nitsoi los;t her temper and threw her change at the yo%ung woman.
Sh)e called Ukrainians' use of Russian words "linguistic schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to ref/rain from using Russian letters even when writin`g last names.
Recently Nits]oi announc*ed that the n`ame "Rus" was stolen from Ukrainians, and thus Russia should be referred to as Muscovy.
Even the Ukrainian Security Se]rvice could not evade the writer's wra<th: having visited there and ov.erh.ear.d conversations among coworkers in Russian, she started a scandal a/nd absconded, slamming the door.
During t-he break we had a man-to-man talk, and i)t bore fruit
“ Ural ” defender Denis Kulakov speaks about t~he victory over “ Arsenal ” (2:1) i"n the ninth round o}f the Russian Championship.
“ Denis, what do you b,eli,ev,e was t!he driving force for this victory? ”
“ I believe that w>e wanted to w`in more than they did ”, “ Ural ” offic$ial website quotes Kulakov.
“ It turned out to be a really tough game, w@e ha,d a serious man-to-man talk during the break, a@nd it bore fruit: we scored two goals and k>ept the opponent at bay.
“ Y#ou missed a few matches d}ue to your injury at the beginning of the month.
How do you feel to-da-y? ”
“ I played the enti-re 90 minutes, so all is we(ll!
In fact, I f*elt good.
Maybe at the end I slowed u~p a lit,tle to keep things safe.
Otherwise, the medics and physiotherapist V*ladimir Gashnev led me to this game, and I a"m s-o thankful to them!
“ Wh\at can you say about t|he atmosphere in the team? ”
“ It is no great secret th>at after victories it is easier to recover and t(h(e mo`o`d in the team is positive.

Irregularities registered during referendum i)n Macedonia
Four incidents associated with violations of electoral law ha@v@e been registered i*n the Republic of Macedonia during a r.e.ferendum on an intergovernmental agreement with Greece about renaming.
This was reported on Sunday by pres_s s;ecretary of the Interior Ministry Toni Angelovski.

At a polling station in the Lazo Angelovski elementary school in Skopje, 22-year-old K.Z|h . violated public order and peace, insulted citizens and attacked pol_ice o/ffic/ers.
He was detained and t=a=ken to a police station.

Th}e ministry noted th>at in all irregularities were being checked.
"The ministry will act in accordance wi]th the law, so that citizens can peacefully us-e their constitutional right to freely exp%ress their will.
W.e call on citizens to observe laws and refrain from any violations of public order a)nd pea,ce and any violations of electoral secrecy, '+' said the Interior Ministry representative.
In the referendum on Sunday citizens were inv+ited to answer one question: "Do you support membership of the E{U and N(ATO by accepting the agreement between the Republic of Macedonia and the Greek Republic?"'
The referendum is aimed at settling a 27-year disput^e between Macedonia and Greece about the name of the former Yugoslav republi|c, which coincides with t?he name of a northern Greek regi'on.
A:t an offici%al ceremony on 17 June on the bank of Lake Prespa, through which the border between the two count]ri]es passes, the foreign ministers of Macedon,ia and Greece signed an agreement on the official name of the former Yugo$slav republic.
It envisages the u]se of the n@ame "Republic of North Macedonia".
This agreement should solve not only the many-year dispute about the name of the country, but also open a path into NATO an!d the E?U fo!r Skopje.

I want to say that this is a very timely step, and we a:re v>ery thankful t*o Russia for its efforts in this re_g_ard," the minister noted.
The head o#f the S?yri?an Ministry of Foreign Affairs also stressed that S-3?00 is a defensive and not offensive system, and it i:s intended for protecting the Syrian sky.

Elections to the parliament o?f Armenia ma[y take place as soon as in 2018, announced the pri[me minister of the country Nikol Pashinyan.
"Possibly, by the end of the year," r/ep/lied t.he head of the government to journalists' question a,bout the timefra,me for them to take place (quote from Interfax).
Mr. Pashinyan als<o did not exclude that "again people will take to the streets" for condu+cting early elections, if the discussion of this issue with parliamentary forces i}s n+ot crowned with success.
But I am inclined to cond+uct negotiations with pa[rliamentary forces.
I hope that they are also ready for a constructive dialog", the premi'e'r wa]s quoted as saying by Novost;i-A;rmenia.
Nikol Pa,shinyan added that ear<ly elections are a d(emand of the people, and also a part of the government's program, for which the parliament voted.

At the General As;sembly of the UN in New York, M&r. Pashinyan promised after his return to Yerevan to start "negotiations with representatives of al#l parliamentary, and also non-parliamentary forc)es, i~n order to discuss the timing and conditions of early elections".
In the c^urren^t parliament abou=t half o)f the deputies represent the Republican Party of Armenia (RPA) which is in opposition to Mr Pashinyan.

Accusations were news for Dagestani de*puty
The Sovetsky regional court of Makhachkala remanded in custody for two months the deputy of th@e People's Assembly Radzhab Abdul-atipov, suspected of participating in a c$ri$minal organisation that documented disability status fo@r bribes.
K/ommersant learned the details of materials of the investigation, shedding light on how, exactly, accordin"g to the Investigative Committee o@f Russia, the younger brother of the former head of the republic Ramzan Abdulatipov, R-adzha-b Abdulatipov aided the criminal ac:tivit:y of the now former head o>f the Ma.in Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices.
Among other things, in the course of the crimin%al intelligence and surveillance operations conducted by employees o`f the Ministry o`f Internal Affairs, it was established t-hat Radzhab Abdulatipov had lobbied for the appointment of Magomed Makhachev to t?he p'osition of head of the bureau, allegedly having received for this 70 mln rub.
Recall that earlier, in relation to Magomed Makhachev, other manager@s and employees of territorial bureaus of medical a?nd social exper>tise subordinate to him, the investigation opened a criminal case under art . 210 (creation of a cri\minal org(aniz(ation with the use of professional position and p"articipa"tion in it), art . 290 (receipt of a bribe by an organized group), art . 292 (forgery by a|n official) and art . 15/9 (larg;e scale fraud) of the Criminal Cod_e of the Russian Federation.
As follows from the case materials, a}t the end of 2013 Radzha*b Abdulatipov, knowing about the illegal activities of Magomed Makhachev and his accomplices, who were engaged in the theft of funds from t[he Pen`s`ion Fund, joined their activities, having entered the crimin|al organization.
Holding the p!ost of head of the directorate of the Federal Migration Service of Russia in Dagestan and ha~ving connections wi@th governmental authorities and law enforcemen%t structures, and also using his familial relationship with the leader of Dagestan, Radzhab Adulatipov, investiga*tors believe, "ensured the activity of other participants of the criminal organization, established contacts with offici:als of governmental bod,ies for th|e support of the illegal activity o\f Magom[ed Makhachev and his holding of the position of head of the federal state-funded institution '<Main Bureau of Medical and Social Expertise of the Republic of Dagestan', organized the illegal confirmatio;n of disability status of citizens".
After disclosure of this information at the meeting o=f the Sovetsky regional court on Friday Radzha]b Abdulatipov denied th!e accusations against him.
"Of course, all, that today is brought on me in the form of an accusa`tion, to me it i-s all new, I am completely u>n>aware o'f it," he said.
Th,e court arrested the deputy from Unite<d Russia not for 10 days before bringing charges, as was with previo>us high-ranking Dagestani bureaucrats, but immediately fo'r two months, since the case includes art . 210 of the Russian Criminal Co%de.
According to the Criminal Procedure Code, for brin~ging charges the inves|tigation has much more time – up to 4)5 days from the moment of detention.

Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic will meet with Russian President Vladimir P?utin i_n Moscow.

I.n addition, Vucic int?en?d?s to ask Putin for support.
The Serbian leader made this stat:ement during a press conference, as reported by t>he local newspaper Vechernye Novosti.
Ac*cording to the source, th!e head of Serbia clarified that when spea/king of the need for Russian support, he does not mean military support as in Syria.
Alexandar Vucic s\aid he did not want to all}ow a s;cenario in which any major military clashes could ignite in the state.
The president has promised to ma|ke every effort to preserve peace, the newspaper repor^ts.
Accor"din"g to the Serbian media, the m~ee~t~i~ng between the Russia a<nd Serbian presidents is scheduled for Tuesday, 2 October, writes Lenta.ru.
A day earlier, it b,ecame known th|at the Serbian president had brought the state ’ s army on full alert due t/o the situation in Kosovo.

Kosac.hev: At the 73rd session of the UN General Assembly the subject of R;ussia in a negative light w,as practically absent
The head of the Federation Council committee on foreign a\ffairs Konstantin Kosachev considers that the 73rd session of t~he UN General Assemb)ly w/as successful for Russia an~d does not exclude that it could become a tur}ni}ng point in the perception of the Russian Federation as an integral participant in the solution of global world problems.
"The unique-ness of the current 73rd session, in my opinion, is in that the rhetori*c, to which we had already almost become accustomed in recent years i=n relation to Russia, was n$o$w m)uch more subd<ued," said the senator in an interview published on Sunday by Rossiiskaya Gazeta.
H?e explained tha:t in pre#vio#us years the Russian Federation was sometimes "referred to a[s one of the three main threats to humanity, on p~ar with Ebola fever or climate change or terrorism, Russia was among these, in any case, in the narrative of a group of we;ste;rn countries, which o$n this account spoke out quite unanimously".
At the 73rd session, emphasised Kosachev, `,` the subject o'f Russia in a n<egative light was practically absent".
"If one carefully analyses the speech of the president of USA, the president of Fran_ce, the speech of th@e foreign minister of Germany, I'm not now taking Ukraine, Geo)rgia, or the British, in any case, there was certainly no choir," t!he politician pointed out, noting that Russia `>` is no longer a kind of wal|l on which to practise hitting a t,ennis ba%ll".
The head of t,he Federation Council committee does no/t e&xc&lude that this indicates a kind of tendency which, i_n his opinion, "will distinguish the current session [of the UN General Assembly], although this tendency may only fu&l&ly manifes(t itself in a year, in two, three".
"I do not exclude that the current session i`n s;om;e sense may be pivotal," allowed Kosachev, explaining that "there are too many examples of how with t;he inclusion of Russia it i,s possible to move forwa[rd in international affairs".
As an example he gave the situation in Syri:a, around Iran and No(rth Korea.
"At the mom!ent, unfortunately, it is not Ukraine, but I do not doubt that in time the Russian view on the Ukrainian c*risis wil,l also be sought," the parliament*a*rian added.
He supposes that this i+s connec_ted with the appearance of a "sensible, reasonable perception of Russia as not just a possible but integral participant in the solution of g[lobal problems of ou:r time."
"I h.ope I am not mistaken, but I have a feeling that w>e will pass the point somewhere beyond which movement will not be backwards, it will b{e movement forwards," he add"ed.
One othe}r "interesting and important feeling" i?n this context Kosachev said was the "demand for the Russian view of how the mo&dern world should develop".
"I was present at a great many meetings of the head o_f the Russian delegation [at the General Assembly session] foreign minister Sergey Lavrov, I held my own meet^ings, and with grea|t pleasure I sa>w that while one-two years or five ye;ars ago on the whol'e nobody was interested in the Russi,an opinion, the Russian view of what is happening in the wor)ld, now the situation is different," sa!i!d the chair of the Federation Council committee.
In hi's opinion, this is due to how `|` t(he so-cal!led new liberal order, represented by the West, does not have answ=ers to the questions of how to solve international problems due to the obv&ious lack o/f ideas in the global space, the lack o}f ideas on how to solve the problems of the Middle East, problems of terrorism, problems of nonproliferation of nuclear weapons, problems of migration".
"And now the demand for the Russian view i(s becoming more a!nd more obvious," Kos,ac,hev said with certainty, stressing that in this sense he considers "the cu'rrent session successful for the work of the Russian delegation, successful f$or Russia".

Every day French journalists, politicians, cultural figures, including people who know you well, a|re fasting in support o\f Oleg Sentsov, o>ther political pri:soners of the Kremlin, and of course, you.
There is not a single international meeting, not a single ne/gotiation, not a single interview, i}n which th%e President of Ukraine, the Ukrainian government, we all, have not de.manded that pressure is put on the Kremlin, th!a!t pressure is put on Putin, with one demand - Oleg ’ s rel=ease, R[oman ’ s release, the release of the political prisoners of the Kremlin and the people w?ho are being illegally detained in the occupied territories of Donbass and Crimea '#', - said Ge;rashch;enko.
She also expressed confidence that these hardships will toughen up every Ukrain@ian, making us `]` angrier, tougher in protecting th@e national interests of Ukraine, in protecting every Ukr!ainian, in understanding what i?s good and what is evil".
We remind you that the correspondent of Ukr,inf,orm in France, Roman Sushchenk$o, was detained b&y the Russian security forces on September 30, 2016 a,t a Moscow airport.

Vakhtang K+ikab+idz+e on the fight against cancer
Now many artists a$re talking about how they m]anaged to beat cancer.
The disease, unfortunately, do-es not spare anyone, and popu{lar people ’ s stories about their victories over cancer give hope to m_any sufferers.
Th%e famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitted that he was ali@ve only thanks to his wife.
Many years ago h"e wa>s diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, which sounded like a sentence.
"It fe=lt like a hammer had hit t-he bottom of my skull.
I fel\l over.
I b,ecame disorientated.
I was admitted t"o the hospital.
There I could not hold a spo=on, could not stand, and fell over al>l the time.
They began to do tests, and th^e resuls turned out t=o be bad, the artery w#as not allowing the flow of blood.
They took me t;o Moscow, and there they said that there was a large purulent cyst in my h%ead, and they did a*n urgent operation.
And during the operation, t:he doctors saw a tumor behind the cyst", - said Kikabidze in the progr:am "Once Upon a Time '?'.
The t_umor turned out to be malignant.
Then, 37 ye:ars ago, the residents of Tbilisi even c\ame to his doorstep to say goodbye to the&ir idol.
But the actor's wife did not allow the livi}ng actor to be written off, she firmly believed tha>t he could beat the disease and f}or ov&er a year did not leave her beloved husband's bedside.
If it were n<ot for Irina, I would not be alive no'w.
W%hen I have faced emergency situations, she has always been th/ere, like a ro~ck", - the actor admitted.
The actor m`anage`d to beat the disease, and now h(e happily lives in his house in the ce$nter of Tbilisi.
And from ti<me to time h}e denies rumors about his illness, about his untimely death, which continually a(ppear online.
The creators o%f the website "Peacekeeper" added the Hungarian Foreign M~iniste~r Péter Szijjártó to the "Purgatory '_' section.
The r@eason was "an encroachment on t_he sovereignty and territorial integrity of Ukraine".
In addition, the head of the MFA of the neighboring country was accused of "d]i]rect threats of invasion of Ukra+in+e" and "sup~port for separatist sentiments in Ukraine", as well as particip(ation "in organizing a provocation aimed at the massive violation of Ukrainian legislat.ion by Ukrainian c@itizen@s".
Note th?at ahead of Szijjártó t}he governor of the Kiev-Pechersk Lavra Pavel and Onufriy, the head of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow P:at:riarch:ate) were put in the "Purgatory '@' section.
The reason was their opposition to receiving t,he Tomos by the Ukrainian local c<hurch.
Ea,rlier, commenting on the issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrainia+n citizens in Zakarpattia, the President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko demanded respect fo-r the sovereign rights of Ukraine.
Authorities named the price o"f the “ golden parachute ” for the depu"ty governor of Voronezh.
The deputy governor o.f the Voronezh region Yury Agibalov was paid 23 monthly salaries based o#n the regional la@w “ On state positions ”.
However, the actual size of the “ golden parachute ” for the official who was released from the post that he w-as temporarily occup-ying was in fact several times smaller th&an t*he sum mentioned in the media ”
These clarifications we)re provided to the press service of t}he regional government.
According to the law, the monthly sal^ary on Agibaev ’ s position is 11,189 roub[les.
Thus, the one-o!ff payment was 223,892 without the inc?ome tax, the press service stated, not one million, a,s the media reported.
The official was receiving pension starti;ng from July 2018.
He was at the state service fo-r more than nine y%ears.
Th!e payment and pe'n'sion were accrued to hi_m after he resigned, explained the regional government representative to RIA Novosti.
The additi]on to the pension wasn ’ t payed when he was a{t the state position, and his salary didn ’ t c;hange compared to the previous period.
Aleksandr Gusev, temporarily acting as a gover`nor won the governor elections and entered the post on Se.ptember 15.
Agibalov was freed from hi|s job i`n the end of his governor term.

State Duma deputy urged t'o talk to school children about the dange"r"s of masturbation
Onishchenko h.olds the post o@f first deputy chairman of the committee for education and science.
Based on the experience o_f his work, he noted i#n an interview that teenagers are provoked to masturbate by harmful information they find on t#he internet.
It ’ s worth fighting against this at the level of educational institutions a/n/d families, th>e deputy added.
Genna]dy Onishchenko, deputy of the State Duma of the Russian Federation (in an int]erview with the radio station "M|oscow Speaks":
As part of the general sexual education of c/h/ildre/n, this must be done, explaining the harm, because here there is a risk specific to the sexual hea"lth of th#e child, bo+t+h boy and girl.
Th.e pro=ble=m i!s objective, it lies in the fact that c^hildren reach puberty quite early, and then a large discrepancy appears between their puberty and ability to officially enter into intersexual contact.
According to Oni>shchen>k>o, "prudishness", the hushing u?p of "pro_blems of a sexual age" and the lack of a culture o/f adequate parenting are preventing a solution to the problem.
Th"e doctor is sure that many teenagers encounter masturbation.
The deputy b!elieves that the provision of lessons about the dangers o^f masturbation is most of all worth it in the school@s of "hyper-urbanized" regions.
"If we start th:is conversation in our Muslim republic, they wi-ll simply not understand us, to put it mildly", - said the pro]fess]or.
Gennady Onishchenko is an acting academ`ici`an o]f t=he Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, member o=f the Presidium of the Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, doctor of medical sciences, professor.

AfD is now second by p^opula^rity in Germany
Th]e anti-immigrant “ Alternative for Germany ” party set a new rec\ord for popularity, while Angela Merkel ’ s ratings are fallin~g.
By all acco|unts, Germany ’ s residents have started to seriously tire of Angela Merke%l ’ s immig{ration poli=cy, which has made the country a desired destination for millions of refugees from the Middle East.
Clearest of al}l on this matter are the latest opinion polls: Alternative for G'ermany keeps g~etting more popular, while the positions o@f Merkel and Seehofer, who head the two allied governing parties, are weakening.
This we%ek the A<fD set its latest record, rising to second place in popular preferences.
At 1#7%, the conservatives have managed to stay ahead of the social democr_ats, who have a{bout 16%.
A gap of one percentage point could be attributed to statisti<cal error, but th)e fact still must be noted that the AfD, which was established in 2013 ou"t of a small group of economists and eurosceptics, w`as able to t{urn into a serious political force.
Lea?ding in overall standing is still the CDU/CSU union o<f parties, which has about 30%.
But a falli?ng trend is still observed: In April, support fo?r Angela Merkel ’ s union of parties was still four percentage point+s higher.
T)he German chancellor ’ s personal rating is falling, while she is leading the gove/rnment for a fourth ter`m in a row.
Support now for Angela Merkel stands at 48%, w&hi&ch is 7% lower than last y!ear.
We should add t]h]at after the Social De:mocrats are the Greens (15%), the Left (11%), and th]e Free Democrats (1&0%).
The Evolutio'n of the “ Alternative ”
The Alternative for Ge+rma+ny party w/as founded i'n September 2012 out of the “ Electoral Alternative 2013 ” group, which ha*d taken in former members of the Christian Democratic Union.
The group initially arose in opposition to g_overn_ment policy, but earl:y on it handled only economic issues, including problems with the euro and interactions within t"he EU.
The group spoke out against Germany “ subsidizing ” weak EU economies, and did(n ’ t exclude the possibility o[f reimbursing Germany and of a full exit from t}he European U<nion.
As the immigration crisis deepen|ed, the AfD ’ s pla\tform expanded.
In 2013 the grou%p became a full-fledged political party, which occupied the Eurosceptic niche and b/egan to harshly criticize the government for the failure of i+t+s immigration policy.
I~n the las+t parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to enter the Bundestag for the first time, getting 94 seats (out of 7$09).
Two representatives of Alternative for Germany received seats i.n the Eu!ropean Parliament.
A video was published with a j)ournali)st who called the citizens o:f Ukraine "a nation of blockheads"
The hos)t of a political talk show on Ukrainian TV and author of two books O,stap Drozdov admitted live that he considers his compatriots to be a `#` na.tion of blockheads".
They believe t]he TV and read little.
A/s Drozdov noted, it is difficult t^o live and work in such a country.
`.` From childhood w_e were not taugh)t a culture of reading and acceptance of texts", - the journalist said.
Local national;ists immed!iat!ely criticized Drozdov ’ s words, accusing him of lack of patriotism and greed.
As previously reported, t&he State committee for televisio\n and radio-broadcasting of Nezalezhnaya began a c&ampaign against literature, in which there are the slightest hints of criticis&m of th&e Kiev authorities, banning the import of whole 201 editions.

Anyone who wishes ca@n purchase this automobile.
The company Roshel Defence Solutions ann]ounced t]ha]t it is already receiving orders for its armored car.
Roshel Senator APC, armored car for the apocaly/pse
The theme o(f the apocalypse is not just profit^able for video game makers, film studios, and b)ook publishers.
N^ow automobile companies are mastering this niche, w~hich is new to them.
Thus, the Canadian Roshel Defence Solutions came out with its armored car fo\r the a-pocalypse, t~he Senator APC.
In their time spent not pursuing dreams, the engineers of this compan)y make armored cars fo:r the police.
The Roshel Senator APC is designed for 12 passengers, who are contained in a f+ull+y welded armored capsule that lacks special comforts, bu|t is completely secu@re.
This bunker (it could no&t be called anything else, since its armor level satisfies the B7 standard) is instal?l?ed on the chassis o>f the powerful Ford Super Duty pickup tru\ck.
I_ts bottom, also armored, can protect the capsule f|r|om grenade explosions and anti-personnel landmines.
Inte>rior of the Roshel Senator APC, armored car fo^r the apocalypse
In order that passengers not be harmed even by the blast wave of an explosive detonated near the automobile, the interior o+f the c,a,r i[s equipped with special shock-abso[rbing chairs.
Fu`rt`he`rmore, the capsule has a`n autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing system.
F<or safe vision, t`he Roshel Senator APC is equipped with an omnidirectional camera system, including night>vision, as well as an armored lookout tower on the roof.
The automobile does not h*ave any weapons.
The front portion of the interior of the Roshel Senator APC, armor!ed car for t-he apocalypse
In order that the weigh-t of the armored car not reduce its mobility, t>he Roshel Senator APC is equipped with a 330-horsepow]er durable turbo-diesel 6.7 liter motor, the entire power of which is transmitted to the four wheels of t}he armored car through a 6-speed au(to(matic transmission.
The Roshel Sen,ator AP)C simply has no chance of getting stuck
The Roshel Senator APC, armored car fo_r t]he apocalypse, may be seen at a s|pecial exhibition in Washington in October.
Timeframe named for death of th\e Universe
The Universe will exist for approximately 140 billion mo&re years, which is 10 times more tha-n t@he age of the o:bse:rved world, equal to about 13.8 billion years.
Research of an international collective o"f scientists was published in a library of electronic prepri]nts and sent for publication in the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Ja>pa>nese newspaper A~sahi Shimbun.
Experts arrived at similar conclusions by using the HSC (Hyper Su'prime'-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope to ob+serve about ten million galaxie`s.
Tracing the distribution of dark matter and dark energy, which account for more tha}n 95 percent of t#he energy mass of the observed world, scientists, w'orkin'g within the standard cosmological model ΛCDM (Λ Co=l=d Cold Matter), es&timated the rate of expansion of the Universe, whi'ch turned out to be a little s?lower than previously thought.
A press release from the Observatory Subaru notes that the observations p.rovided a detailed three-dimensional map of the distribution o,f matter in the Unive*rse, and the recording of data from the European space telescope Planck cla(rifi(ed the restrictions imposed on th*e parameters of ΛCDM.
I>n Ju;ly scientists modeled the possible death of the Universe.
Three ye$ars earlier their colleagues presented new conclusions sup`por`ting the view that the observed world will end its existence i%n 22 billion years as a result of the Bi|g Rip.
Another attempt fails t=o unit&e the initiators of the pension referendum
The opportunity to elicit the publ,ic's o:pinion about pension reform has been postponed indefinitely
A meeting of t+he nationwide initiative group for a referendum against raising the retirement a"ge was he,l,d in Moscow on Saturday.
Representatives of 13 subgroups took part in the meet:ing, putting forward proposals for the wording of questions (in to't'al, the CEC registered five qu`estions).
They decided t]o apply t|o t(h(e Central Electoral Commission to register a single initiative group and ask the public the question: "Are you in favor of th~e pension age, as established by legislation as of Jul}y 1, 201|8, at which Russian citizens gain the right to an old-age pension, not being increased?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose representatives did not participate i,n the meeting, but it was consi*d*ered the simplest and legal]ly most succinct.
Most of the meeting participants were supporters of the Fair Russia member I!l!ya Sviridov (six subgroups) and the Communis$t P*arty of t!he Russian Federation (four subgroups).
They were joined by three independent subgr}oup}s fr!om Nizhny Novgorod, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Ear.lier, Sviridov told Vedomosti that invitations were sent to all the initiators, and representatives of about 40 subgroups e;xpressed thei!r agreement to take part.
But, for example, Marina Semenova, who heads the Vologda subgroup (the wording of her question wa}s supported by another 15 su$bgroups), told Vedomosti that she di:d not receive an invitation and did no^t plan t:o take part: "It was not clear who our friend was and who our enemy '#'.

In the match between Lokomotiv and Akhmat, T-urbi-n's errors ra!ined down fast and furious
Forme,r all-union referee Vladimir L;e;v;i;tin commented on the performance of referee Evgeny Turbin in the match of the 9th round of the Russian championship between Lokomot#iv and Akh,mat and assessed the controversial incidents of the game.
"How would you assess Evgeny Turbin's refereeing in the match bet;ween Lokomotiv and Akhmat? '\'
"I believe that the referee confirmed that he is not suitable for refereeing mat-ches in the Russ<ian Pr)emier League.
It surprises me that with the mes;s in the fifth rou;nd game b;etween Spartak and Dinamo, neither Turbin himself, nor the heads of Dinamo drew any serious conclusions about his la=ck of abilities.
The result had a quick impact on the ninth round: errors in hi:s performance and missed calls on bad tackles raine,d down fa_st and furious.
For example, in the 50!th minute, Locomotiv's Eder pus^hed over Akhmata defender Rodolfo in his own pena`lt`y area.
Just eight meters from the goal line, bu.t Turbin did not call a p}enalty".
"How would you assess the incident w\ith the participation of Idowu, who in the 82n-d minute appeared to handle the bal#l?"
"I belie(v(e the defender deliberately handled the ball i"n his own penalty area.
Turbin was close t,o the incident, had a g]ood view o?f it, and his assistant was to the right.
This incident should have been seen by the fourth offici,al Ser'gey Karasev.
Ho-we-ver, none of the three referees did not see it, and no penalt}y was awarded.
Therefore, the s$core was corrupted, an"d any sporting justice was ripped up.
It was a case in which refereeing b[y the rul]es was ousted an@d the sporting spirit of the game buried".
"In the 52nd minute, Turbi.n di!d not dare t%o send off defender Oleg Ivanov, who commited a foul in a d[uel w/ith Krychowiak, and when the referee showed him a yellow card, he defiantly applauded him.
What do you think o%f this incident?
Was it nece\ss\ary to brandish the second yellow card? '"'
"In this incident T<urbin brandished th[e first yellow card in somewhat spurious circumstances.
A second would have been lo@g@ic".
"Oleg Ivanov talked after th?e match a[b[out refereeing double standards in that some teams are awarded a penalty for suc`h violations, as in the incident with Idowu, a/nd others are not.
How would you assess the player '<s words?"
"It depends on ho!w you interpret double standards.
I(t was a penalty.
But it was n?'t given.
So the r'e'fere'e did not give a secon&d penalty in the opposition goal.
That was t"he principle applied here.
And the second incident with double standards is that t`he refere$e looks at who is playing.
On Saturday Locomotiv and Akhmat played, and there have been serious complaints about Turbin's perfo^rman^ce, becaus=e the team was put at a disadvantage '>'.
Saturday Night Live started w>ith Matt Damon playing Judge Kavanaugh, who has be%en accused of rape.
Matt Damon played US Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh, who i}s accuse>d of rape.
Damon appeared i\n the first episode of the new seas_on of NBC ’ s Saturday Night Live.
In a sh"ort skit, the actor pla,yed Kavanaugh at the Senate hearings where he is accused of rape.
Earlier, the Supreme Court appointee attracted attention with h@is emotional a<nd detailed accounts during discussions with Senator Amy Klo>buch>ar.
So, Kavanaugh repeatedl@y admitted to his love for beer, but state|d that he had never drunk to the point of memory la*pses.
In addition, in his attempt to vindicate himsel'f from th{e rape accusation, Kavanaugh stated that in those year(s he had been a virgin.
D/amon also played these details up.
“ Al(l I did w|as drink lots of beer, and I wasn ’ t thinking at all about se]x.
I was the proudest, drunkest v\irgin that anyone eve*r saw.
Everyone knows that, ” said the judge as played b<y Matt Damo&n.
Earlier Kavanaugh was c{on{f{irmed as a judge for the US S;upreme Court.
Barbra Streisand discovered strange be-hav-ior in her cloned dogs
American singer B\arbra Streisand said that the clones of her dead dog behav^e completely differently from the original pet.
"Th<ey are not alike.
In fact, [the clones] look like her, but cl?oning the soul i@s impossible," emphasized th!e 76-year-old singer.
A't the end of 2017 Streisand orde=red two clones of her 14-year-old dog of the Coton du Tulear breed named Samantha, whic^h had to be put to sleep due to health pr(oblems.
In July 2018 it was reported that a dog of the chihuahua breed nam%ed Miracle Milly, whic{h was named the s<m<allest dog in the world, had been cloned f]or the 49th time.
S-pecialists are engaged in cloning the six-yea\r-old animal in an attempt to understand why it is so small.
The United States has contemplated a naval blockade o`f Russian deliveries of oil and ga]s
T%he U#nited States could begin a naval blockade of Russi.a in order to obtain an advantage on the global energy market.
The US government is so eager to fight f"o"r success on the global hydrocarbon market th<at it is pr>epar>ed to resort to a naval b^lockade of Russia, which remains one o*f the world ’ s main suppliers of fuels.
US Department of the Int=erior head Ry"an Zinke spoke yesterday of the possibility of a naval blockade.
Unlike other similarly named government agencies around the wor[ld, the department conducts not police functions, b-ut civilian o)nes, and this includes carrying out policy in the area of natural re*sourc*es.
For th)is reason, Zinke ’ s announcement falls entirely within his sphere of responsibility, though not wit)ho)ut politica>l overtones.
Appearing at an industrial event in Pittsbu>rg, Zinke stated that with its naval forces the US control's shipping lanes i-n the Middle East and could block them i+f the need arose.
Zinke ’ s words could l}ead to the conclusion that the need may be tied to Washington ’ s desire to interfere with Russian del&iv&eries on the global energ$y ma$rket.
Zin`ke mentioned that Russia still received the lion ’ s share of it~s income from world oil and ga.s deliveries.
He said he is sure that a de>sir>e to distribute energy shipments in t'he Middle East a%s wel[l as Eastern Europe was the prime motive for Moscow ’ s expansion in this region.
The ag-en-cy head made it clear that the US is still considering maintaining its leadershi"p on the global energy market, now that it has become the largest supplier o-f oi+l and gas.
For this, Washington will have to pu.t confine Russia an'd Iran, and Zinke considers a naval blockade o]f commercial routes to b(e an acceptable means to this end.

Exp{ensiv{e violin passed onto a pawnshop for pittance
When a man brought a violin to a LBC Boutique and Loan pawnshop locat"e"d in the city of Somerville, Massachusetts, the pawnshop worker o,ffered only USD 50 for the o]ld and flimsy-looking in)strument.
But an experienced store manager, Dyla{n McDermmitt, suspected that it was in fact a]n old and expensive instrument, and he decide;d to consult with a;n expert for an appraisal.
It was then discovered t;hat the violin was made in 1759 b.y the famous Italian violin maker Ferdinando Gagliano and is es#timat#ed to be worth USD 250,000.
The bows alone for such violins are valu%e%d at US}D 16,000–18,000.
An investigation re>vealed that the v?i?o?li?n had recently b,een stolen from one of the residents of the city, and the instrument was then returned to its rightful owner.
It is not yet known how the person w&ho sold the violin t`o the pawnshop obtained the instrument, but i+t is known that the sel>ler had no criminal background.
T@he manager says that now everyone who brings a violin to the pawnshop will be asked to play i>t to make sure that i$t really belongs to them.
Exciting clash awaits fans i`n ninth round of Rus.si.an Premier League Spartak will take on Rostov at its stadium in Tushino under the leadership of Valery Karpin, a man who, as we know, i#s no stranger t]o the “ people '}s team ”.
The fact tha%t the clubs current_ly have a"n equal number of points (15 each), occupy 3rd and 4th places in the standings, lagging behind Zenit (which has a dis)tant lead) and only one point ahead of Dynamo, makes this match particularly s$ignifi$cant.
The red-and-whites are going throug-h a rough patch: the cl_ub is again plagued by idiotic scandals . Massimo Carrera's team also unexpectedly took a beating at the hands of SK Rapid Wien in the UEFA Europa League, an>d they recen{tly lost to Akhmat Grozny at h]ome.
After th/e match with CSKA Moscow, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak was abl%e to beat Chornomorets Od&esa with a minimum s*c*ore and not with_out some difficulty in the championship . It is still too early t&o say whether the most popular club in Russia has managed its way out of its crisis.
For three games in a row Rostov has not been able t|o win, but it has go=ne undefeated now for five mat;ches.
Let's see whether Karpin wi*ll be able to extend his team's winning streak by winning s~uc~h a key match that they cannot a"fford to lose.
The previous meeting between Ka`rp`in's Rostov and Sparta\k ended in victory for the capital team.
The start o'f the match i\s set for 7:00 PM.
Aftershocks sh"ake Indonesia after a powerful tsunami
Meteorologists have observed ove%r 170 aftershocks i:n Indonesia, where an earthquake occurred several da\ys ago, accompanied by a three-meter tsunami.
Measuring 7.4 on the Richter scale, the earthquake mainly affected the island of Sulawesi, acc;ording to t*he c<ha<nnel "Russia 24".
Ov<er 420 people perished, and over 5!0!0 were injured.
Authorities had previously warned the population about the threat of a tsunami, but later re%scinded th^e warning.
The f<act is that sensors did not detect the a'pproaching wave.
At this time, the fate o~f dozens of res{idents, who were preparing to celebrate a nati>onal holiday in the coastal city of Palu, the city most damaged by the elements, r;emains unknown.
Lo|ndon brought accusations against Moscow
Russia is attempting to r:e:ver:se the results of the Cold War, announced the British Secretar*y of St#ate for Defense Gavin Williamson.
Nevertheless, the U_K will defend its values, he emphasized durin>g speeches at the Conservative Party Conference in Birmi_ngham.
Threats are mounting, Iran and North Kor[ea are becoming more dangerous, enem>i>es are working in grey areas using cyberattacks and fake news, add{ed the Minister.
But the biggest of them is Russia, which is expanding its military presenc#e in U#kraine and the Arctic re'g'ion.
Moscow immediately co`ntested these al_legations by western politicians, reports TASS.
Then the Br[itish Foreig%n Se_cretary Jeremy Hunt noted that Russia would pay a high price if it flouts international rules and uses chemical weapons.
Hunt mentioned the poisoning in the Brit;is;h city of Salsbury, i"n March of th`is year, of Sergey Skripal, the former Russian military intelligence o`fficer convicted of spying for the UK, and his daughter Yulia.
In the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, a referendum i^s being held on joining the EU and NA[TO, subject to changing the name of th$e country.
The referendum is intended to resolve the 27-year dispute with neighboring Greece over the name of the country, which coincides w;i;th t{he name of th,e neighboring Greek province.
One o!f the first to vote was Prime Minister Zoran Zaev, an ardent su;pporter of renamin!g the republic Northern Macedonia.
The p-reparations f&or the referendum and today's voting are being monitored by international organizations.
The head of the observation mission of the Office for Democra`ti`c Institutions and Human Rights, Jan Petersen, told Euronews how the work of t%he observers is or:ganized:
Approximately 100 teams dispersed across the country toda+y to observe the entire process, from th)e opening of polling stations to their closure, then the counting of votes and the dr.awing up o%f reports.
During the month, 1;0 of our teams worked in th$e country, and they oversaw the preparation for the voting, the work of the media, the observa)nce of the law o=n campaign financing and the organization of t-he referendum.
Fei Dulgeri: `>` About 500 foreign observers are cl-osely monitoring the voting process.
Groups of observers are recording the events in detail a!nd c~ommun~icating with members of election commissions, i&n order to sub|sequently put the information down in the final report".
An inter^pre^ter compared Russian and German mentality
Russians and Germans have different mentality but these differences do\n ’ t p]r]e]vent them from understanding each other.
Berbel Sakse, a professional simultaneous interpreter, related this on t&he International Day o}f the Translator o]n September 30.
Ber|bel Saks is engaged more than 30 years in the translations from the Russian an-d English languages.
Germans like to plan quietly events, a;nd Russians, as they say in a p)roverb, "long harness and quickly go '('.
But it seems to me, for mutual understanding between t^he peo*ple and fo;r work of the translator it doesn't play a major role, ” she said in the interview t/o RIA Novosti.
According to the interpreter, “ it is enough to k-now history ” to understand tha!t the countries ca;n ’ t do without each other
In the future, Sakse noted, there ’ s n?p s<ense for Germany to ignore Russia.
Russia is a natural part of Europe, ther,e ’ s no sense in i"gnoring it.
We nee!d Russian gas, oil, there ar>e a lot of things that define ou|r common destiny, ” she said.
A day before t"he G_erman chancellor Angela Merkel claimed that the country tries to “ start relationships ” with Russia and susta=in them.
Especially important, she said, it the Nord Stream - 2 project constructed from the Russian coast t`o Germany on th~e bottom o"f the Baltic sea.

P]utin appoi[nte[d a new head of the Presidential Foreign Policy Directorate
Vladimir Putin by decree relieved Alexander Manzhosin of duti_es as head of the Presidenti$al Foreign Policy Directorate.
In his place, Ivor Neverov wa=s appointed to this p~os~t.
M-r. Manzhosin had headed the Presidential Foreign Pol{icy Directorate since 2004.
As one of the reasons for his departure a source close to the Kremlin named pers~onal circumstances, noting tha<t there were no substantial complaints about th%e qu|a|li|ty of his work as head of the directorate.
Igor Neverov previously headed the Second Euro{pean Department o>f the Foreign Ministry
In 2009-2014 he was th"e ambassador of Russia i]n Sweden.
Russians donated one ruble for a deputy with lo\w pay
In Yekaterinburg the charitable fund Chel-o-vec-hek opened a collection of funds for State Duma deputy Vera Gan*za, who complained about l_o_w pay.
The progress of the campaig+n can b^e followed on the site of the organization.
"The C-hel-ovechek ch`aritable fund expresses hope that we as the whole world can save this public servant.
We ask all empathetic people t/o gift a chance a|t life and a happy future!
A-ll collected funds will be given personally into t@he hands of the poor person.
Go>d Save You!" says a mess`ag`e of the fund.
I#n total the benefactor wants to collect 380 thousand rub}les for the deputy, which is the equivalent of a mo"nth's pay.
Accounts of help received are published on the fund's page in VKontakte, where the organization pos(ts screensho|ts o{f money transfers.
The most frequent sums of d]onations are one ruble and 5/0 kopecks.
A\t the time of publication Russians had donated to Vera Gan`za 1633 rubles.
T|he collection of funds started on 28 September after Ganza's complaints o\f a low level of income.
In her words, the average pay of a deputy is 380 thousand rubl<es, from which nothing is le(ft over, so i^t is necessary t~o spend money with a credit card.
Ganza complained th:at parliamentarians are not compensated for expenses.
After this in the Duma it was announced that th@e possibility o?f reimbursing expenses would be considered.
The film "Between Two Waters" was award=ed the "Golden Shell" a.t the festival in San Sebastian
The film "Between Two Waters" (Entre dos aguas) by the Spanish director Isaki Lacuesta w_as recognized as th"e best film of th$e 66th International Film Festival in San S]ebas]tian.
T?h?e film w@on the main award of the festival - the "Golden Shell".
The Norwegian actress Pia Tjelta was awarded the "S{ilve{r Shell" for best actress i>n the film `-` Blind Spot" (Blind Spot).
The b(e(st actor was named the Argentine Dario Grandinetti for the film `;` Red" (Rojo).
The director of that film, Benjamin Naishtat, w(a(s awarded t,he title of best director.
The comedy Night School topped t;he American box office.
The comedy Ni^g^ht School, which d@ebuted last Friday at American mov[ie theaters, earned $28 million on its first weekend in distribution.
This success allowed the unimaginative flick starring Kevin Hart and Tiffany Had-dish t\o top the US bo)x office for 28-30 September.
Released so far in only 20 countries, the f@ilm brought in $5].]5 million, including $2 million from British vie(we(rs.
In its fight for first place, what ’ s remarkable is that thi>s creation of Malcolm L%ee pr.ett.y clearly got ahead of another newcomer in western distribution, the cartoon Smallfoot, a curious sto#ry of a c<harmin<g yeti meeting a representative of humankind, whose existence the st"arr"i"ng character had never believed in.
This project of directors Karey Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig collected $23 million o*n its kickoff weekend, basically justifying th.e expectations of experts who had pred+icted $20-25 million for th(e weekend.
Regard>i>ng Smallfoot ’ s total box-office receipts, at the moment they amount to $38.6 million (whi*le it has debuted a;lrea;dy in 50 countries): Its most a+ctive market was Mexico, filling the coffers with $3.6 mi@llion.
T"he top th&ree at the time was completed with the children ’ s tale “ The House with a Clock in Its Walls, ” from horror master E_li Roth . This p!ro!ves conclusively that the director can produce quality movies f+or the 12+ audience too.
For its secon{d week in distribution, the scree%n adaptation o]f John Bellairs ’ book with the charming Jack Black and Cate Blanchett earned $12.5 million, bringing total glob}al receipts to $53.8 million.
In spite of its departure from the top 3, the thriller A Simple Favo*r, with Blake Lively and Anna Kendrick, continues to be a>n incredible sur'prise: The movie was not realistically expected t]o perform well financially, but during 17 days in distribution in America this movie by Paul Feig collected $43 million (includ=ing $6.6 million for 28-30 Octobe}r). And right n>ow it actually has $6|2.|9 million in total sal'es.
The last o$f the top fi}ve this week was the horror s!h!ow The Nun, which raked in $5.4 million in the reporting period.
During 24 days in Am"erican (a[nd of course o,th,er) theaters, the spin-off film The Conjuring has total earnings of $330 milli;on an<d now proudly bears the title of most successful franchise movie . The franchise also includes the two parts o]f The Conjuring and the two films about the terrifying doll Annabelle.
The results o,f the past weekend show that right after this Corin Hardy horror movie comes one more from that genre, the newly-appeared Hell Fe.st, which is one o@f the major youth horro~rs of the year.
On its first weekend the movie earned $5.1 million in t^he US . It is the brainchild of the famous fi(lm edi{t{or and now director Gregory Plotkin, who has previously worked o-n a set of big horror projects including Happy Death Day, which Hell Fest i,n some parts strongly resembl(es.
The result i)s extremely positive when compared to t:he film ’ s modest budget.
The seventh was Crazy Rich Asians ($4.=15 million), which seems unlikely to fal!l out of the American box office top 10 . The romantic comedy ha]s now been on screen for seven weeks, and f_or September i{t ’ s the sixth-highest-grossing film of the genre in history, with $165=.7 million.
That ’ s exactly the amount the movie has earned so far on the domestic ma_rket; its total revenue is now $21?8.?8 mill]ion.
The l{ast thr~ee of the US top ten by revenue fo>r 28-30 September were Th|e Predator, White B/oy Rick, and Peppermint — last weekend they earned $3.7 million, $2.38 million, and $1.1 million, respectively.
We ’ ll add that next weekend in the US, the long-awaited Venom wi(th Tom Hardy w.ill be in full swing . It will without a doubt take over the leading position i&n the American box office on th.e first weekends of O{cto{ber.
Of t.he othe-r premieres of the coming week, the musical drama A Star Is Bor"n dese'rves spec~ial mention . This movie by Bradley Cooper won at the Venice Film Festival . And also the crime drama The Hate U Give.

"This is ugly n'epot'is'm"
The audience is outraged by the ch(o(ice of Agutin on the show "Voi;ce"
The viewers of t=h=e show "Voice 60+" accuse the m~entor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen sha<m".
When in b]lind auditions he recognized t'he voice of his father Nikolay Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that he would remain neutral and not t}u}rn to the perf/o/rmer.
But filial feelings took over, a!nd he picked a rel&at&ive for his team.
The/n many considered it a joke, but fo\rgave the mentor bias at the first stage.
But t%he "joke" dragged on, and the star's father abs~olute~ly unjustifiably took the p|lace of more worthy performers.
And now the viewers are not re\ady to forgive Agutin for suc'h an injustice.
Yesterday we, the viewers o\f the show, were outraged b&y nepotism by the ugly and frank dragg<ing our close relatives onto the final ladder.
I even doubted that A;gutin h.ad the stamina and sense of conscience to not dra*g his dad to th=e end all the way to first place", - discussed Irina Petrovskaya and Ksenia Larina in the program "Person f~rom the TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake o|f his father, Leonid Agutin "ejected ';' won<derf<ul performers who ac*t*ually sang, while Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching song about his mother, explaining that the viewers still w>ant to see his father in the show.
But, as it t%urned out, this is n@ot a-t all the case; the viewers want an objective assessment and to see genuinely talented performers i:n the final, and now Agutin has discredited the show.
"I sympathize with the participants of `+` Voice" from the Agutin te*am - they were doomed".
"Last t_i_me, Agutin showed how he loves hi$s dad, but today he had to prov{e himself as a professional".
"The competition has lost i"ts meaning".
"Remove tw`o talente'd people from the project a;nd leave your father in the project who does not sing but whispers, how do you call a mentor a+ft+er this? ",
"You like how your da-d sings, then organize a concert in the Kremlin with your money a.nd see how many people come to t/his concert".
This is the show "Voice", and not t$h$e show "Big S`hot Relatives".
"On the part o?f Agutin, this was unprofessional '~'.
"Then you have to offer dad t;o perform on your own show, and not on a show that is made wit*h the mo+ney of Channel 1".
"This was a real chance f-or someone, and h^e took someone's place.
And I don ’ t understand why the voiceless dad shou\ld evoke a gr%eater appreciation tha$n any other participant with real vocal skills.
Why was the worker from Surgut with a magnificent voic\e and ti]mbre ejected, an(d Agutin's father brought to the finals?
And then we all complain that fo$r decades ther#e are the same faces on th%e stage and on the screens!
Yes, because yo)u cannot b=reak through nepotism!"
`:` What did you expect?
Thi_s is Russia!
Cronyi`sm and nepotism everywhere.
And the money in th;e family budget wi?ll come in handy!
The theater of the absurd continues! '-'
The users also recalled that i<n one of the seasons of the traditional `*` Voice", the son of Gradsky took p|art in blind auditions.
Then in no way did it oc:cur to the mentor to take his son into his o\wn team.
Moreover, he said: "Come on, get out of here, everything i=s cl=ear".
Agutin could not act l/ike a professional.

A scientist spoke about a possible scientific expedition program of the Russ?ian Federation to th~e Moon
The head of the Space Research Institute of the Russian Academy of Sciences, a~ss~oci~ate member o|f the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich talked t>o RIA Novosti about a possible research program for Russian cosmonauts to the M<oon.
According to him, the scien.tific community is now dev&el&oping directions for such activities.
"T~here is no consolidated opinion yet", - the scientist e<mphasized.
He noted that o}ne of the options is to place a low-frequency radio telesc:ope on the far side o,f t(he Moon, which would help to avoid interference that originates from the Earth.
"This is the only place where such a telescope c=an be deployed to r"esearch cosmic sources of radio waves", - Petrukovich ad$ded.
He also believes that t~he Mo@on could be used for testing robotics, to use local resources for construction.
In addition, cos@monauts should be engaged in the s_earch for primitive organic matter on th>e Earth ’ s satellite, the scientist believes.
This could he+lp us work out how lif*e comes into being on planets.
Earlier, the head of t*he "Roscosmos ” corporation s@a@id that in an optimistic scenario th<e Russian Federation could carry out a man?ne?d mission to the Moon by 2030.
Offended customer d^ump^s basket with feces at the 7-Eleven store
Da}mi}an Si)mm)s, a 41-year-old resident o~f St. Petersburg, Florida, harbored a grudge against th}e manager of a 7-Eleven 24-hour convenience store: in May Simms was ejected from the store by the manager for inappropriate behavior.
So Simms decided to get back at his enemy in a$n original w-ay.
At ha&lf past one in the morning, he entered the store and dumped the contents of the basket that he brought with hi\m partly on t:he floor a|s well as partly on the products on the shelves.
The basket contained feces and urine, which Simms "borrowed" fr(om a nearby porta toile`t.
Police who arrived at the scene o>f the incident arrested the "ave:nger."
He was booked into jail and was released by posting bail of US,D 300 pendi?ng trial.
He was c!har!ged w;ith unlawful trespassing onto another person's property and a criminal offense, and he w&as also forbidden to en(t(er the store again or to approach the manager.
Although Simms's crime seems mor,e ridiculous than serious, his cou?rt sentence could b-e quite harsh, sinc<e he is a repeat offender: he has been charged with grand larceny, robbery, illegal possession of a we(apon, drunk driving, and animal abuse.

I think that h`e will play in future games.

I h?ad a g)o)od start, but in the second turn I got caught betwe`en two cars which immediately sandwiched me.
I instantly lost all the ga[in[s t]hat I had made at the start.
I ended up i(n a really bad position.
I was stuck in traff`i`c.
We hoped that af;ter the others took a pit stop, there would be clean ai(r and the pace woul^d step back up, but the t;ires were worn out.
H&e also fo'ught with his partner, with whom he also made contact.
A>s I understand, he made a few mistakes.

Tarpishe]v said the removal of Glushakov and Eshchenko from the starting lineup of Spar}tak was absurd
Rus[sia[n Tennis Federation President Shamil Tarpishev com&mented on the removal of soccer pl"ayers Denis Glushakov an|d Andrei Eshchenko on Moscow ’ s Spartak team from training with the starting lineup after a “ li~ke ” on a criticism of the team ’ s head trainer Massim^o Carrera, says Sport Weekend.
Carrera ’ s actions were a&bsolut&ely absurd.
To p!ay attention to things l|i|ke that is utter stupidity.
I a#bsolutely disagree with what Carrera is doing.
It only deepens the discord on th>e team.
And first of all, it was just poems . You can interpret them a$ny w;ay you like.
If I were in Carrera ’ s place I wouldn ’ t ha;ve reacted a;t all.
After all, eve"r"yone has their own opinion.
And second, everybody wants t$o brag.
If Glushakov a:nd Eshchenko post “ likes, ” that doesn ’ t mean they have something agains=t th$e trainer.
I think that Italian isn ’ t flexible enough in his perception o-f t&he situation.
A)nd that doesn ’ t help create a positive a}t}mosphere on the team.
Spa!rt!ak doesn ’ t have a game today, so th*ere ’ s no reason to blow thi[s whole thing out of proportion.
Mayb)e he should have just laughed with them abo~ut it.
There ’ s a lot about Spartak that isn ’ t right . They haven ’ t gotten their act t{ogether after the young)er players came o{n the team.
“ Judging from all of t_his, ” Tarpishev is sure that “ th:is isn ’ t boosting optim)is)m before the game . ”
The two teams will pla)y on 30 September starting at 7`:00pm Moscow time.
John Terry, fire?d earlier from Spartak, led the youn-g Chelsea team.
T*he “ Sirius ” students discussed nature-like technologies with researchers
The students of the education centre “ Sirius ” in Sochi, partici[pating i\n the School of agrobiology and plants gen^eti^cs, visit&ed a lecture of National research centre “ Kurchatov institute ”.
The lecture was a part of Global international forum of convergent and nature-like technologies organi]sed inSochi at the instructio]n of the Russian president Vladimir Putin, says th,e education centre ’ s si$te on September 29.
The lecture was opened with a documentary “ Kurchatov ’ s code]s ”, in whic^h the institute ’ s president member o`f the Russian Academy of Sciences Mikhail Kovalchuk to;l;d about global challenges tha/t drive the development of civilisation.
The lecture was publish/ed on the “ Sirius ” sit]e.
The school students learned tha`t modern technologies need a lot o!f energy.
Alternative s&ources can ’ t produce t`h`i`s amount of energy yet.
Nature!-like technologies that are being developed by the young scient/is/ts, will solve this problem, say the forum ’ s or?ganisers.
Ap#a#rt from this Kovalchuk talked about risks and responsibility when developing nature-$like technologies.
“ T"he advent of such technology i]s a unique phenomenon and a huge benefit.
They mean an explosion in medical technologies, improvement o,f th)e life quality and infrastructure.
But th>e>re is another side.
Development of nature-lik'e technologies is in fact reproducing the live nature ’ s sy!s!tems.
There is an*other side - it is an intended interference in t)he man ’ s life.
Risks ar{e everywhere.
When a car ap\peared, peo}ple started dying under its wheels.
But we stil,l use cars.
All t`e`chn`ologies are double-sided.
When I am creating a medical techno?log?y, I may be at the same time c\reating a weapon of mass destruction, sai>d the scientist cited by REN TV.
After the film screening a)nd disc!ussion about the recent scientific achievements, the student$s asked questions to the participants of the meeting.
The speak}ers were the candidate of physics and mathematics, head of Kur\chatov complex of nature-like technologies Yulia Dyakova and th&e head of Nano- Bio- Info- Cognitive and Social science?s and technologies (N-BICS) complex of Kurchatov institute Vyacheslav Demin.
The education centre “ Sirius ” i{n Sochi was created by t{he education foundation “ Talant and success ” o*n th)e basis of the Olympics infrastructure at the instruction of president Vladimir Putin.
The ce|n|tre is aimed at d~iscovery, development and professional support of gifted children.
Earlier in September it was reported that t;he winners of all-Russia online competition o=n informatio\n safety “ Cyberchallenge ” will be granted a chance to st"udy in “ Sirius ”.
An air traffic controller saved a passenger p[lane during an earthquake in Indonesia at the cost of his ow?n life
Indonesi{a bid farewell to air traffic controller Antonius Gunawan Agung, who saved hundreds of Batik Air pa^ssengers a$t the cost of his own life.
On September 28th he was w?orking at the Palu's Mutiara SIS A{l-Ju{frie airport on the island of Sulawesi.
An airliner was prepar(ing f{or takeoff at the moment the powerful earthquake struck.
Agung refused to abandon the air traffic control tow+er, and helped the airplane take o)ff.
When the magnitude of the quake reached 7.4, the towe&r started to col}la}p}se.
The 2$1-$y$ear old air traffic controller was forced to jum<p from a height of four stories.
Upon landing he su)ffer)ed serious trauma to his internal organs, and doctors w.ere unable to save him.
Russian submarine Kazan frig;htened USA
The greatest da;nger for the fleet of the USA i[s posed by the Russian submarine Kazan.
So said American Re(ar A_dmir_a_l Dave Johnson, Rosbalt reports citing The National Interest.
“ W]e ’ ll be facing tough potential opponents.
One only has to look at the Severodvinsk," he said, pointing at a predec:essor mod>el o"f the Kazan.
In the opinion of the commander of U-S Naval Forces Europe James Foggo, Russ[ia has concentrated i?ts efforts on modernizing its submarine fleet.
Macedonia: the referendu.m failed due to the low turnout
The referendum w]a]s intended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Skopje t}o rename the Balkan country to "Northern Macedonia ';'.
Greece objected t/o the use by the Macedonians o+f the name of its historical province.
The renami+ng offered prospects f!or the former Yugoslav Republic to open a way to NATO and later the EU.
But, as the EFE agency reports, t#he just 34% turnout at t_he Sunday pleb*isc*ite "did not reach" the constitutional threshold of 50%.
However, since th[e referendum w&as only advisory in nature, the authorities in Skopje may decide not to reje>ct the renaming.
Spea`king soon after the closure of th#e pollin|g stations, the prime minister of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, a supporter of changing the name of the republic, said tha;t i<f among the votes cast there are more "yes" votes, then Macedonia will change its name, despite t:he quorum not reached.

Residents of Kemerovo outraged by flock o@f sheep in cemetery
On September 30, a message was posted on a frequented social network page devoted to Kemerovo b-y an e_yewitness stating that livestock fre,ely roam one of the l<ocal cemeteries.
A fairly large sized herd o,f animals has been browsing between the fences and ar\e eating the grass.
Commentators expressed various opinions: some local r)esid)ents n{oted that a few livestock in the small cemetery causes no harm to anyone, and their a?ppetite could even help clear the a+rea o;f weeds and mow the grass . Nevertheless, some residents of the city are not enamored of th$e animals.
On!e outraged resident of Kemerovo posted (style p'reserved): "This is a buri{a{l place, not a pasture.
Sheep have n_o business being there.
O'f course, you can't say that the sheep are commiting an act of blasphemy, b%ut that's not the point . '+'
In any event, one of the eyewitnesses noted that the problem of the presence of the animals in the middle of the cemete$r$y is already known, and the necessary meas/ure/s w(il(l b/e taken soon.
'Davlet ’ (to exert pressure) o.r 'dovlet' (to loom over) - whic)h is correct?
The wo%rd 'davlet' does not exist.
'Dovlet' is co<rrect.
T-he word "davlet '{' with the meaning of "draw towards, exert influence, an impact" exists only phonetically, because we hear the sound [a] instead o`f [o] in th.e wo?rd "dovlet".
We us<e this word believing that it comes from th.e word for pressure ('davlenie').
But "pressure '-' and "loom over" are etymologically n^ot only not close and are even in some sense opposed in me]anin]g.
Have a t)hin)k about that for yourself.
'Dovlet' (to lo<om over) (liturgical, literary, obsolete) means "quite, complete, enough, to be sufficient f}or s#o#meo#ne o}r something, to satisfy".
I<t is related t,o the words 'dovolstvovatsya' (to be content) and 'udovolstvie' (pleasure).
Previously, i$t also had the meaning of `[` not to d}epend on anything, to be self-contained" - "to prevail over oneself".
The Old Slavonic "довьлѣти" ('dov~leti') is ak/in to t'he words "command" and "will".
"Davit" (to crush), "podavlyat ';' (to suppress) are completely d*if*ferent.
These words h@ave g<enuinely creepy "relatives": daos - "wolf" (crushing sheep), deyja - "to die" a~n~d dvaidī - "t$o oppress".
The similar phonetic appearance of the words "davlenie" ("pressur]e") and "davlet" ("t/o l@oo@m over"), as well as the inev.itable obsolescence of the latter, forced them to c?ontaminate one another.
So we had this ver,y "d [a] vlet ’", which is also used in writing w`ith an "a", w=hich, really, is incorrect and impossible from the point o&f vi^ew of the processes of the origin and development o'f these words.
So, it's correct to write "dovlet ':' ("to loom o:ver").
But this word i)s obsolete and in its correct meaning it is n+o longer used.
If you want to no#te that any circumstances/people exert a negative imp}act on you from abov[e, use the word "davit" ("to oppress").
You can also use the construction "exert pressure", but rem^ember that this sounds bureaucr.atic.

Our ca-r is noticeably slower than Mercedes
The Ferrari drive]r Kimi Ra;ikkonen speaks about the Russian Grand Prix qualification round, in which he came fourth.
"Kimi, today did you have the chance to fig#ht for t+h+e pole?
How did th{e car perform?
`;` It looks like Mercedes were much faster toda(y", said Raikkonen, as reported by F1News.Ru.
But the performance of our car was the best since the beginning of the we,ekend '%'.
`~` During qualifying you were no slower than Sebastian Ve`ttel, but i<n the end the gap was still quite large.
What w`as the reason for that?"
"I wasn't doin)g badly, but th-en one of the Mercedes drivers got ahead.
He was preparing to overtake a_nd manged to get r=ound me, and this evidently lost me some time.
However, it i]s unlikely this gre}atly affect the result"
"It is very diffi*cult to overtake in Sochi . Will t*he start of th|e race be the key moment?"
Basically you never know how things will tu/rn out.
In any case it won't be easy, because our car is noticeably slower than Merced+e+s '|'.

Miracles are always happening in our lif`e!
T|h|e German journalist Christie Dietz discussed o@ne of them on Twitter.
She wrote on her page that h]er four-year old s+on parked his balance bike (children's bicycle without p{edals) on the same lamppost all year.
One morning, a sma`ll sticker appeared on the lamppos>t with a photograph of the green bike and th,e inscription: "Only".
The delight of mothe%r and child was boundless.
Christie thanked the anonymous benefactor and praise)d him for his interesting and fresh id%ea.
Her tweet quickly spread t"hro"ugh social networks a}nd made many people smile.
Comments t~o it were also remarkable:
"This is miraculous! '<'
"Thank you for beautiful communicatio_n i)n this world."
"I think there ar.e few people in the world capable of such an a{ct."
"Unfortunately, t<hey do not draw the same attention as the mischief of sc/oundrels."
"This is the world that w<e need!"
Read.ers asked the journalist to tell them if she ever manages to find out who h<a<d the i"dea to put the sticker there.
Of course the culprit, by all appearances, must have b,e,en somewhere nearby: h-e saw the boy p_ark his b~ic~ycle more than once before the idea occurred to him.

Vuchich implemented the highest le!vel o?f battle readiness for the Serbian Army
Ser@bian President Alexander Vuchich ordered the implementation o<f the highest level o@f battle read{iness, to which the country's Armed Forces were brought due to the situation in the north of the Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija.

Russia p\rotected itself from terrorists with its operation in Syria
After three years of Russian military operations in Syria, approximately 100,000 te.rrorists hav~e been killed, of which 8#5,000 were killed by the Russian Aerospace Forces.
This was discussed i{n connection with the t!hird anniversary of the start of the Russian military operation in Syria by th*e former commander in chief of the Aerospace Forces, the head of the Federa&t&ion Council Co\mmittee on Defence and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accuracy o?f airborne weaponry: Aerospace Forces have preci=sely struck and continue to precisely strike al`l their terrorist targets.
In Bondarev's words, after three years in Syria t+ens o]f thousands o)f terrorist targets have been destroyed - including, fo`r example, ammunition stockpiles, fortifications, and headquarters.
Russian airstrikes brok.e the jihadists' defences - this was a decisive investment in th@e advance o`f Syrian government forces, reports Interfax.
In this regard, in the words of Bondarev, th(e operation o?f our forces in Syria allowed the protection of Russia it$self from terrorists, ma\ny of whom had Russian passports.
At the s,tart of the operation in Syria over two thirds of the territory o=f the Arab Republic was under the control of terrorist groups, including the "Islamic Stat(e" (I^S, prohibited in Russia) and "Jabhat al-Nusra" (prohibited in Russi;a).
According to the data o?f the General Staff of the Russia}n Armed Forces, four thousand IS fighters are Russian citizens and aro|u|nd five thousand are citizens of po\s\t-So\viet countries, reports TASS.
This figure refers only to those people who have been identi&fied, and does not taken int{o account those who were not identified, Bond:a:rev emphasized.
The majority o\f them wer$e trained and prepared to take up arms at any moment, and Russian passports gave them the right to freely enter the territory o;f ou~r country.
Thus, rem?ark?e?d Bondarev, in Syria Russia fights international terrorism abroad - otherwise this evil would "spi.ll over onto u(s."

The head of the Syrian Ministry of Foreign Affairs Walid Muallem accused the US'A and its partners of wa_r crimes in Syria and su)pp)or)t of terrorism.
[The Western] coalition completely destroyed the Syrian city of Raqqa, i.t destroyed t=h=e infrastructure and public services in are&as against which its actions we)re aimed, it committed mass mur{der of the civilian population, including children and women.
These murders according to international l%aw a?re war crimes," he said.

Th,e President of Ukraine Petro Poroshenko believes that w@hile respecting the s/overe/ig/nty of other states, Ukraine has the right to demand the same respect for its own sovereignty.
The h/ead of state said this during a trip to the Kharkiv re<gion, commenting on th(e issuance by Hungary of their passports in Zakarpattia.
By protect,ing Ukrainian citizens, I defend the sovereignty o$f our state.
Just as we respect the sov/ereignty of other states, we demand th<e sam>e respect for Ukraine", - said Poroshenko.

Furthermore, "Volkswagen" promises to buy e;ve;n n>ew car&s if German cities ban diesel engines on their streets: the authorities gained this right in February of th*is year.

Metropolitan Hilarion compared t_he decision of Kiev to rename the UOC w_ith actions of fasists
The head of the synodial Department of External Church Relations of the Russian Orthodox Church Met>ropolitan Hilarion compared the renaming of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of the Moscow Patriarchate to the Russian Church in U,kraine with th*e actions o_f fascists in relati?on to Jews.
`_` It is the equivalent of how in fascist Germany they pinned a ye^llow star on Jews, it means marking the Church as an enemy organization, and precisely f>o>r that purpose this draft legislation was c\reated," sa<id the metropolit%an in a broadcast of the television channel Rossiya-24 (quote from Interfax).
In his opinion, this step will have the most serious cons&equ&ences rig(ht now, when the Russo-Ukrainian conflict is a't an acute stage.
Kiev in this way hopes to receive full c!ontrol over the UO"C and `,` outlaw it", considers the clergyman.
`#` It is a Ukrainian church, and the believers of this church consider themselves Ukrainian, they are patr/iots o%f their country," he added.
Earlier it became known that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada are working o\n implementing draft bill No . 4128 (on changing the gove[rnance o)f religious organizati(o(ns), N,o . 4511 (on the special status of re:ligious organizations,) and No . 5309 (on renaming religious organizations).
The latter proposes renaming t>he UOC of the Mo|scow Patriarchate.
Vica/r of Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra calls for protection o{f Orthodoxy and Ukrainian shrines
T_he Vicar of the Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra Metrop~olit~an Vladimir called for the protection of the Orthodox faith a:nd Ukrainian holy places.
The text of his appeal to follow,ers of the Uk(rainian Orthodox Church (UOC) was published on Saturd\ay on the monastery's website.
A`s the metropolitan noted, "Christians ha#ve been called upon to confess their fa<ith and protect their shrines at different times in the history of our predecessor"s and spiritual brethren.
In l;igh;t of the situation tha\t has developed, and based o>n the information that we have obtained as well as th@e threats of reprisals that are spreading, it is clear that we are being called on to live through a period of adv-er-si-ty as well . ”
He called for prayers and other form<s of moral su$pport.
In addition, the vicar o~f the Lav>ra emphasized that "your physical presence will also like[ly be required."
The priest adde}d: "Lenin '^s spiritual grandchildren are threatening reprisals, and therefore we need to defend our shr-ines."
The message states: `=` As people who care about the fate of the Pochayiv L#av#ra, an Orthodox Ukrainian sh'r'ine and holy place of worldwide significance, we must be ready to defend it . '\'
Th;e Metropolitan urged his followers not to be taken in by those who mislead be@lievers.
The vicar continued, "The UOC has canonical s=tatus, a^s was determined by t*he Tomos of October 29, 1990, tha%t was issued by the Mother Church.
And now someone wants to make us dependent on the newly styled Patriarch Bartholomew, w@ho i)s a friend of the Roman C.atholic pope.
This new styl}e with the consequences th[at it entails is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
We are p)le)ase)d with the status t.hat our church already has."
He recalled that since October 1990, th~e UOC has been canonically independent as well as c~ompletely administratively independent:
"I@t is in no way administratively or financially accountable to the Moscow Patriarc,hate.
In fact, our church already ha-s a tomos.
What furth/er Tomos do w;e need?" The metropolitan of the Holy Dormition Pochayiv La_vr_a Vladimir u)rge)d believers and all citizens of th)e country to ask themselves: if other confessions have a Tomos, does that make them independent of the Vatican?
The priest emphasized, "Believers have already understood and decided wh_ich ch&urch they will attend.
However, someone wants to sow hostility an)d discord on#ce again.
Some are stung with envy of the churches and t]heir s/hin/ing domes, and they want to des*tr*oy them."
The Holy Dormition Poch>ayiv Lavra is the lar{gest church and monastery complex in western Ukraine.
The monastery sits atop t.h.e Pochayiv hil]l 70 km from Ternopil.
The first historical re(cords of i@t date to the beginning of the 13th century.

Dynamo Moscow head coach Vladimir Voro.byev - about “ Avtomobilist ”'s defeat (0:1) in t?he KHL regular season championship matc-h.
“ It w[as a good game, a>n interesting one, though it only lasted until a goal", “ Avtomobilist ” official webs+ite quotes Vorobyev.
"We tr]i]ed to play very simple.
Liked the fir>st period very much.
Didn't take advantage of some good c~hances.
In the sec,ond period, o^ur rival pressed hard, but we survived.
But t/he ejections “ fed ” us a bit.
The guys played really well, carried ou<t th"e coach ’ s instructions.
I think tha>t i`f we continue to play like that, the victories will come.
D:id not sco}r}e, a@nd with no goals you cannot win a game, but the very content of the game was right.
Success will come if we continue to pl/ay in this direction ';'.
“ I|n y`our opinion, did “ Avtomobilist ” improve from the game in Nizhny Novgorod?"
“ The foreign team did not pl*ay there.
During pre-season, the te#ams worked on other task, many you~ng guys did play.
I think that was a completely different game, diff&er&ent hock^ey.
“ Avtomobilist ” i}s a good, t~o~p quality team.
J.udging by the tournament table, the tea;m is playing well.
Good hockey, a great atmosphere in t^he arena a)s well as in the city.
We can only w[ish them good luck.
The team is moving in the right d|irec|tion.
There ’ s many good players, and leade&rs.
A t#op quality defense and good goalkeeper.
It was difficult, we train}ed hard.
We knew that the team was unbeaten, we wanted t+o brea]k their run, but it w;asn't to be".

The main Macedon,ian opposition leader refused to vote on the re$ferendum
On Sunday, September 30th, in Macedonia, a refere@ndum will take place o.n the question of an int*er-governmental agreement with Greece on renaming the Republic of Macedonia.
Citizens must ans#wer one question: "Do y}ou s"u"pport membership in the EU and NATO, making an agreement between the Republic of M%acedonia and the Republic of Greece?"

As announced b#y the par!ty press secretary Naum Stoilkovsky, Mitskosky decided to abstain from voting in order t?o express their disagreement with the agreement, which h`e considers "detrimental."

A week ago, the Presiden%t of Macedonia George Ivanov refused to participate in the refe~r~end~u~m.
He clar(ifi(ed that he chose t"he name for the country 27 years ago in a referendum o,n independence . The Macedonian leader looks negatively o}n the idea of renaming the country.
"It crea^tes a new semi-sovereign governme+nt with a new name," remarked Ivanov.
The agreement on the ne@w official n>ame of t.he forme~r Yugoslav?ian Republic - the Republic of Northern Macedonia - was signed by the heads of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs of Macedonia and Greece on June 17th of this year during a ceremony on the shore o^f Lake Prespa, through which runs the border between the two countries.

The USA is behind the growth of opiate pr'oduc'tio'n in Afghani*stan
The sharp exacerbation o{f the situation in Afghanistan on Sep]tem]ber 26th was much discussed in Iran.
There m#any conferences took place involving Ir#an, India, C"hi"na, Afghanistan, and Russia, which was represented by the Secretary of the Security Council Nikolai Patrushev.
I%n essence, in the territory of Afghanistan fighters waged a real territoria<l war against the government authorities a\nd peaceful population of the country.
"This year set a record for the number of bloody terrorist attacks, as a result of which thous[ands of innocent Afgh`ans have died," remarked Patrushe(v.
Afghanistan's troubles bega)n long ago.
After the terr}orist attacks o(f September 1/1, the terrorist group "Al Qaeda '\' (prohibited in the Russian Federation), entrenched in Afghanistan, was declared to be the USA's chief enemy.
Not a month passed before America and its NATO allies beg^an Operati\on Enduring Freedom there.
S]eve]nt]ee]n years have passed.
Several thousand Ame'rican troops are currently in Afghanistan territory.
Nevertheless, peaceful life i[s even more illus]ory now than before.
A<merica<n forces have been driven behind the fe^n^c^es of dozens of their bases.
Despite their efforts, mi'litants are paid off me\r\el\y not to touch them.
The Government of Afghanistan contr]ols a minority of the country's territory - 40%, according t'o Patrushev.
50% is controlled b&y th;e Taliban (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
Another 10% is co+ntrolled b%y ISIL (prohibited in the Russian Federation).
But they a/re quickly growing.
Their goal is t.o create a barbarian pseudocaliphate in Central Asia - exactl_y the o}ne that did not succeed in Iraq and Syria.
By all appearances, America is behin`d this.
America is also behind the fact t#hat, a,fter 17 years of its presence i^n t?h?e region, the production of narcotics (opiates) in Afghanistan has increased by at least a factor of 40.
The colos-sal growth in fields s[ow[n with opium poppy and multi-billion dollar profits.
Macedonian;s are prepari,ng to vote in a referendum on joining t}he EU and NATO, subject to changing the name of the country.
An ag^ree^ment to rename the former Yugoslav Repub"lic o;f Macedonia as the Republic of Northern Macedonia was reached on June 17 as a result of long-t_e_rm negotiations with neighboring Greece, which refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbor to be called Macedonia, perceiving that such a name challenged the same Gree"k province and Gre]ek history.
Lyupko Petkovsky, political scientist: `\` Thanks to this agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is gaining the right to a better f^uture and ho@pe for social change.
And Greece will secure its righ=t to its past.
There are n;o perfect agreements.
They arise a$s a result of difficult compromises and they cannot make absolutely everyone h\appy".
The ruling social democ^rats, led by th=e prime minister Zoran Zaev, are in favor o}f renaming the country.
The conservative opposition and the country '=s president Gjorge Ivano`v are against it.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimano]v, i@t does not ma]k]e sense f<or Macedonia to join the EU - it is suf-fici-ent to have partnership relations with it: “ Many people who d"o not like the agreement believe that the current socialist government headed by Zaev has bee(n imposed from the outside in order to change the name of the country.
But this decision will bring about n[egative consequences.
First of all, loss o@f sovereignty.
Clearly there are countries that would n$ot want Macedon>ia to remain one of th<e sovereign countries in the Balkans".
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: “ Th,e former Yugoslav Republ>i>c of Macedonia is facing t=he biggest challenge in its history.
The country i[s at a crossroads.
The choice that t`he citizens of Macedonia will m{ak{e will deter:mine the future not only of the Balkans, but also of Europe as a whole".
The Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation predicted th^e ruble exchange rate fo@r 17 years ahead
The Ministry o~f Finance of Russia expects a gradual weak'eni'ng of th}e ruble exchange rate - up to 73.9 rubles per d%ollar by 2031–2035, follows from the draft long-term budget forecast submitted to the State Duma along wi*th the draft federal budget.
In 2021-2025, the ruble exchange rate, acco'rding to the forecast, will be 66.4 rubles p/er dollar, in 2026-2030 - 71.1 rubles, and in th:e ne#xt five years - 73.9.
The department notes that these figures a-re the nomin)al rate.
The real effective exch"ang"e rate (a figure that takes into acco>unt changes in the exc{hange rates of the countries that are the main trading partners of the Russian Federation) will remain st'able, officials say.
As for inflation, by 2020 it will be 3.5%, and then it will stabilize at the level o|f about 4%, according t$o t\he Minis(try of Finance.
