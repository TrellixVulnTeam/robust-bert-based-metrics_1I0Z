Russia's vice premier minister Dmitry Ko]z]ak has announced this while recounting his meeting with Russian car m:anufactu:rers before t"he Russian g=r=an prix s:t:art i\n Sochi.
Also, th_e vice premier minister sha&red his o/pin/io/n about Daniil Kvyat ’ s return to “ T+o+ro Ross%o ” and app}rov}ed the popularity o,f the Russian stage of “ Formula-1 ”.
O%ur meeting with car producers should result in creating a Russian car for F=ormu=la=-1 i?n th=e nearest future which would have n*o analogs in t(he world, said Kozak.
We have t.o motivate our ca.r producers t*o work in this direction.
This was planned to h`appen b.y 2024 but I d\o\n ’ t think it ’ s p{o{ss{i{ble in such a s$hort term.
I thi_nk a more realistic time-frame would b~e wi@t@hin the netx 10 years . ”
From 2012 t@o 20[14, the Marusya team participated i|n Formula-1 under th]e Russian license.
Accor>ding to th:e v+ice premier minister, some investors are alread[y re|ad|y to invest i]n the creation of a team for the Formula-1 World Championship ’ s.
I know that in Russia there are fan$s of motor sports, a#ff#luent businessmen, w^ho a]re ready to inve\s\t, ready to invest i$n t\he creation o!f a Russian Formula-1 team, he noted.
“ We are ready to support th+ei+r effor.t.s.
We hope tha^t such team wi"l"l make its appearance.
I suspect that the idea to create s.u.ch a team a[ppeared in part due t-o t:he appearance o,f new infrastructure in Sochi ”.
Tomorrow, “ Soc<h<i Autodrom ” i\s s#old out, ´.
A~ccordi~n~g t>o Dmitry Kozak, the organisers managed t`o sell all 50 thousand tickets.
L~oo~k, even for the qu/al/ifyin/g rounds the tribunes were fu#l#l, said the vice prime mi,nist,er.
I ca#n say that profits this year hav$e by 7[2% compared t"o the previous year.
It's goo$d, it's a positi+v+e result.
Al\so, we a prepa_ring a plan to improv=e the “ Sochi avtodrom ” ef`fecti`vity during the year.
It wi"ll be an additio{nal tourist pro|du|c|t, that will make Sochi e+v+e+n more attractive.
Dmi>try Kozal also t(ouc(hed the main topic for Russian c^ar ra.ce fans - return of Daniil Kvyat in “ Toro Ro\ss\o ”.
W<e all congratulate Daniil and w"is"h him success in the next season, said vic\e mini$ster to “ Izv&e&sti&a ”.
He i,s a promising car r#ac#er.
Ne.xt y&ear, first tim}e in history two main pilots from R.ussia will take part in Formula-1.
A\lthough, Sergey Sirotkin ’ s fut;ure in the “ King ’ s races ” is s$till unc)lea)r.
His contract with “ Williams ” is until the e:n:d of sea`so`n, b}ut the results aren ’ t striking: h~e t-o-ok the 18th place in the Russian gra%nd prix qual<ifica<tion.
W\e ’ ll hope that in the nex>t se*ason there will be more main p?ilots from Russia then th>i>s year, claimed Kozak.

O`n September 3+0, 1928, i&.e., exactly 90 years a'go, the British bacterio%logis%t Alexander Fleming announced an unprecedented discovery.
Th+e discovery of penicillin ma|rked the beg!inning of the era of modern antibiotics, brought Fleming worldwide fame and made him th=e Nobel laur\eate.
By the way, the isolation of penicillin from mold fu!n!gi was no't t<he first discovery of F\lemi\ng.
A few years earlier, when he had a co\ld, he placed m"ucu"s from his own n_ose o{n a Petri dis+h (t]his is a kind o$f a glass dis'h in which experiments ar[e conducted with bacteria) and a few day_s later he discovered that the bact.eria that was there had be=e=n destroyed.
Peni|cilli|n was also dis}covered by chance in almost the sa{me way.
Fleming's name wa{s added to th,e list of t}he 100 most prominent personalities in human h'ist'o'ry.
His discovery, a}cc}ording t)o many scholars, changed the course of hist|ory.
Wit}h the h:elp of penicillin, medicine began to beat the mos$t longstanding diseases previously considered inc.urable - tuberculosis, syphilis, gang"rene ...
Whe\n, shortly afte~r receiving th'e N<obel Prize, in 1945, Fleming arrived in the French capital, Pa~r~is newspapers wrote: “ He did more than dozens o$f divisions to defeat fascism and l@i@bera@te France '`'.
According to experts, Flemi]ng ’ s discovery of the world '"s first antibiotic ha>s saved the lives of m"or"e than 200 m-illion people on Eart|h.
Alexander Fleming died i[n his home in L,ondon in 1955 from a h%eart attack.
H}e was cremated, and a w@eek later his ashes were b,uried in the famous London Cathedr]al of St. Pa'u'l.
Where, by the way, a tal}kative Russian-speaking guide drew the atte&nti&on o:f me an%d my wif]e to it.
And a f(ew years later, we h]ad a c*hance to see Alexander Fleming's full siz#e statue i#n the most unexpected place for this i@n t,he capital of Spain.
There, near th"e main bullfighting arena Plaz`a de Toros d(e L>as Ventas, the famous Spanish ma?tad?ors erected a monument t"o a man, w`hos`e efforts, in their opinion, s`aved the lives of hundreds of eminent b"ullfigh"ters.
By t$he wa"y, I found this very interesting, i\n my opinion, porcelain w@ork at the same p]lace, in Madrid, but at another time and for a comple[te[ly d]iffer]ent reason.

Trump spoke o-f “ being in love ” w_ith Ki(m Jong-un
While earlier they had bullied e;ach other, the leaders of the U=S a}nd North Kore:a have practically fa[lle[n in love, joked Donal{d Trump.
US President Don|ald Trump reporte$d a well-executed joke about their successes in resolving t]he North Korea cr`i`si`s.
After starting with m-utual t@h@re@a@ts of annihilation, now t:he leaders of th=e two countries have smoothed out their relations so well that they a+re virtually in lo;ve with each other, the Amer{i{can President re>m>arked.
Th}e man in the White House mentioned that h+e had taken on the North Ko.rea problem from the previous administration a!s th=e most difficult problem in fore;ig;n policy.
Tr"um"p notes that Barack Oba"ma ’ s team ha"d so neglected relations wi.th North Korea that it co(uld(n ’ t e]ve]n reach the country ’ s leadership b#y phone — t/he other sid\e basically didn ’ t pick up the receiver.
Then t;h;e US and North Kor!ea were on the verg$e of war, but today th(e North Korean leader is wr`it`ing “ beautiful letters ” to t`h`e White House, said Tr%ump.
T!rump admitted t`hat he had been “ nas.ty ” t/o Kim Jong-un, which, b\y the way, was mutual.
But no^w their relations have bee^n smoothed out t@o the poin]t that the leaders “ have fallen in love wit"h each other . ”
Trump meanwhile asked people n{o{t to take his words literally an"d warned tha>t American media will interpret his statemen+ts a[s incompetence.
Trump pointed out that recent~ly Pyongyang had stopped its n)u)clear a{nd missile tests, and is closing militar'y bases.
T*he American president is su?re tha*t all o|f this is the achievement of his administration.
Last Tuesday Donald Trump spoke flatteringly o:f Kim Jon/g-un at a meeting o"f t=he UN ’ s General Assembly.
Trump t)hanked the North Korean leader for his br!av!e!r!y an|d for the steps he has ta_k_en to de-escalate tensions.
Trump also noted that sanctions again:s:t North Korea ar"e being kept in pl}ace until the mo|ment of full denuclearization of t`he Korean peninsula.
Negotiations i>n Singapore
On the 12th of June in S~ingapore, the first n@eg@o@tiat@i@o@ns i>n history took place between leaders of t)h)e US a<nd North Korea.
After a s.ig.nifican.t worsening i#n relations an]d mutual threats to use nuclear weapons, the summit looked l=ik=e a breakthrough in the protracted Nort(h-(K(ore(an(/(American c(risis.
At th*e end of the negotiations, the two sides expressed the i?nt?e?ntio?n to move i[n the direction of a p&eacef&ul resolution of th+e conflict, while not taking on any leg,al obl}ig}ati}ons.
P\ositi\ve results fro?m the meeting were the suspension o`f nuclear and missile tests by Nor>th Korea, as well a(s t#he return to the U+S of the remains of American soldiers from that country.
At the same tim&e, no other pr`ac`t`i`cal steps toward the denuclearization of Nort&h Korea are being tak!en.
News m{edi{a ha)ve reported tha-t after the Singapore summit, the U:S sent several scenarios for disarmament to No.rth Korea, but Pyongyang re[jected them, calling t#hem “ gangster-like . ”

Nitsoi call<ed for replacing "M=oscow la/nguage with a Ukrainian product"
Ukrainian childre$n ']s author and advocate for the purity of her native langu:age, Larisa Nitsoi called for relieving Ukraine from t]he "Russian-language Moscow prod.u.c.t and Moscow lan`g`ua`ge . '['
To d+o this, she pr-oposes as the Ukrainian pr|o|duc|t - "a cultural wav?e, a cultural onslaught . '*'
Nitsoi shared he]r thoughts on "t/he feasibility o]f eradicating the Russian language in Ukraine" with th$e Ukrainian publi!ca!tion "Observer".
In he,r wor;ds, th'e right Ukrain%i%an product is ready now - i?t already exists and will continue to be developed.
With time, U`krai`n`ian`s will "r]eco]v]er" from this "Moscow language", sh*e ass<er<te<d.
For example, in neighboring Poland, in her word!s, Russi%an speech was widespread on te<levision and rad~io, but it wa#s practically absent in th(e public arena.
In t'his regard, in Nitsoi '~s opinion, U~kra~inia~ns are not using aggressive met'hod's in this process: a.c.tion.s by authorities to prohibit th@e use of the Russ;ian language, i<n h&e&r opinion, merely "expand the boundaries for Ukrainian speech a@t a legal level."
Previously, Nitsoi shared h)er experience supporting a "Ukrainian language regime" a%t a c]hi]l]dren '(s camp in the Carpathians, whe)re she was invited to wor{k.
In D'ece'm'be'r 201+6 she threatened t^o sue the Watsons bookstore chain, o,ne o-f whose cashiers spoke to her in Russian.
Nitsoi lost her temper and thre+w her change at th(e young wo!man.
She called Ukrainians' u|s|e o+f Russian words "linguistic schizophrenia", calling on Ukrainians to refrain from us(ing Russi=an l*et*te*rs even when writing la}st names.
Re%c%ently Nitsoi announced that the name `~` Rus" was stolen f[r[om Ukrainians, a<n<d thus Russia should be referred to as Musc^ovy.
Even the Ukrainian Se}curity Serv<ice could no[t evade the writer's wrath: h,a,vi,ng vis-it-e-d the~re and overheard conversations among coworkers in Russian, she star-ted a scandal and absconded, slamming the door.
During the break we had a man-to-|man talk, an#d i.t bore fruit
“ Ural ” defender Deni_s Kulakov speaks about the victory over “ Arsen(al ” (2:1) in the n(i(n(th round o)f the Russ"ian Champ&i&onship.
“ Denis, wh"at do you bel{ieve was the driving fo[rc[e for this vict,or,y? ”
“ I believe t-hat we wanted to win mo/r/e than t!h!ey did ”, “ Ural ” off}icial web!si!t!e quotes Kulakov.
“ It tur+n+ed out to b(e a re(ally tough game, we had a serious man-to-man talk during th@e break, and it bore fruit: w\e scored t_wo go#als and k~ept the opponent at bay.
“ Y`o`u missed a few matches d/ue to your injury at the beg$inning of t?he month.
H>ow d%o you feel today? ”
“ I played the entire 90 minu_tes, s`o all i/s well!
I$n f-a-ct, I felt good.
Maybe at th/e en>d I slowed up a li:t:tle to keep things safe.
Ot-herwi-se, the med{i{cs and physiotherapist Vladimir Gashnev led m*e to this gam}e, a)nd I am so thankful to them!
“ What can you sa?y ab?o?ut the atmosphere in t$he team? ”
“ It is n'o great secret that after vict(ori(es it is e?asi?er to recover and th~e mood in t~he team is positive.
Now we ar:e on a good run, a`l`thoug`h at first we ha^d s^ome bad luck.
We need t|o continue i%n the same spirit a;n;d make our fans happy ”.
“ Did you miss t~he gam?e dur^ing your time away from the rink?"
“ I did indeed miss it a littl+e, because I really was i,n an unpl%eas%ant s/ituation.
But I would like t;o reiterate my thanks to the physiot.her.apist an"d medics for putting m;e on my feet.
T_he most important thing is that we w;o;n and mad}e our fans happy.
Everything else i!s of minor im%portance".

Elections to th>e parlia.m.ent of Armenia may take place a"s soon a!s in 2018, announced the p$r$ime minister of the country Nikol Pashinyan.

Th~i~s hydroelectric station i#s located inside of Kosovo, b)u)t it is part o>f the Serbian power system.
Kosovo d`eclared i+ts independence from Serbia ten years ago, a m!ove that Belgrade refused t]o recognize.

Kosachev: At the 73rd session o:f th/e UN General A!ss!embly the subject o)f Russia in a negative light wa>s practically absent
T]h]e h(ead o{f the Federation Council committee on foreign affairs Konstantin Kosachev considers that the 73rd session of th<e UN General Assembly wa_s successf&ul f\or Russia and does not exclude that it could become a tu[rning point in the perception of the Russian Fe]deration as an integral participant in t/he so#lution of glob\al world problems.
"The uniqueness o`f the current 73rd session, i!n my opin=ion, is i.n that the rhet]oric, to which we had already almost become accustomed in recent year{s i<n relation to Russia, was now much more subdued," said the senator in a;n interview published on Sunday b/y Ro:ssiisk:aya Ga:zeta.
He explained that i{n previous years the Russi;an Federation was sometimes "referred t<o as one o\f the t`hr`ee main th^rea^ts to humanity, on par with Ebola fever or climate change or ter!ror!is!m, Russia was am*ong these, in any case, i^n th<e narrati!v!e of a group o&f western countries, which on th|is account spoke out quite unanimously".
At the 73rd session, e(mph(asi(sed Kosachev, "t]he su%bje%ct of Rus-sia in a negative light was p[racticall[y absent".
"I[f on~e care.ful.ly analyses the speech of the president o(f USA, the pr-es-ide-nt of France, th"e s@peech of the foreign minister o[f Germany, I'm not now taking Ukraine, Georgia, or th<e British, in any case, ther?e was certainly n[o choir," the poli'tic'ian po'inted o'ut, noting that Russia "is no lo>ng>er a kind of wall on which to practise hitting a tennis b#all".
The head of the Federation Council committee does not ex}clude t"hat this indicates a kind of tendency whic=h, i[n his o{pi{n{i{on, "will distingu?is?h the current se^ssion [of the UN General Asse}mbly], although this tendency may only fully manifest itsel&f in a year, in tw]o, thr+ee".
`\` I d_o not ex*c*lude t;hat t{h{e current session in some sense may be pivotal," allowed Kosachev, explaining that "there are to+o many exampl>es of how with the inclusion of Russia i>t is possible to mo]ve forward in international affairs '/'.
As an example he gav-e the sit/u/ation in Syri#a, around Iran an>d North Korea.
"A$t the moment, unfortunately, it i#s not Ukraine, bu}t I d-o not doubt that in time the Russia@n view o,n the Ukrainian crisi]s will also b}e sought," the parliamentarian added.
H\e supposes that this is connec&ted w?ith the appearance of a "sensible, re~aso~nable p;e;rcep;ti;on o$f Russia as not just a possible but integral pa.rti.cipant in the solution of global problems of our time . '@'
"I hope I am not mistaken, but I have a feeli.n.g that w&e will pass th/e point s|o|mew|here beyond w,hich move`ment will not b#e backwards, it will be movement forward-s," he added.
One other "interesting and impo=rtant f"eelin"g" i+n thi:s context Kosachev said was th%e "demand for the Russian view of how the modern world should develop '~'.
`+` I was present a=t a g`reat many meetings o$f the head of the Russian delegation [at the G/eneral Assembly session] foreign minister Sergey La:vrov, I held my own me=etin=gs, and with grea<t pleasure I saw t<h<at wh%ile one-two years or five years ago on the whole nobod?y wa]s interested in the R&u&s&si&a&n opinion, t]h]e Russian view of what is happening in the world, n]ow the situation i[s different," said the chair of the Fe'd'eration Counc[il committee.
In his opi{nion, thi&s is due to how "the so-called new liberal order, represen-ted by the W^est, does not have answers to the questions o`f how to solve international problems due t.o the obvious lack of ideas in the glob?al s;pace, the lack o&f ideas on how to solve th?e problems o.f the Middle Ea]st, pro}blems o_f terrorism, problems of nonproliferation of nuc`lear weapons, probl'e'ms of migration".
"And now the demand f\o\r the Russian view is beco/mi/n/g more and more obvious," Kosachev said wi<th certainty, stre=ssing that in this sense he considers "the current sessi!on su`ccessful for th~e work of the Russian de;legati;o;n, succes]sful for Russia '.'.

Damask claimed i~t~s right to apply military force in Id~li~b
Damask hopes that there will b^e no need to a[pply military force in th<e Syrian Odlib province, claimed the Syrian m!i!nist!er o'f fo[reign affairs Valid Muallem.
However, he said, Syria ha}s t|h|e right to do s|o.
The m*inis*t*e*r added that Turkey can quickly ge]t the mili]tant]s of Jab_hat al<-Nus<ra, which is for{bi{dd{en in R{u{ssia, out of the demilitarised zone in Idlib, RIA Novosti reports.
The minister of foreign affairs also stressed that Damask will have t`o u]se military force to s+olve th}e problem to the E%ast of Euphrates if curds express separatist int#entions.
At th[e same time, according t)o Mua>lle>m, the talks with currish SDF fo}rces w`ent well u`ntil they were suspended because of the USA.

She s#ai#d this in a video message to the political prisoner recorded on th_e eve of t]he second anniversary of the ille$g$a$l arrest o;f Sushchenko by the F+SB.
According to her, d~uring these days a protest is being held at the walls o=f the Ru/s/s/ian embas;sy in Paris, whose participants have declar#ed a hunger strike, while demanding the release o^f the Kremli|n priso<ne<rs.
Ev}ery day French journalists, politicians, cu]ltural figures, including people who kn}ow you well, are fasting in s\up\port of Oleg Sentsov, other political prisoners of t=he Kremlin, a~nd of co-urse, y;o;u.

"I could not even hol<d a spo<on"
Vakhtang Kika*bidze on the fight against c=ance=r
Now many artists are talking ab|out how they manag`ed to beat c~ancer.
The disease, unfortunately, does not spare anyone, a#nd popu.lar people ’ s s(to(ries about the'i'r victories over canc@er give hope t&o many sufferers.
The famous actor Vakhtang Kikabidze admitte}d that he wa[s a"live only thanks to his w\if\e.
Many years ag*o he was diagnosed with a terrible diagnosis, w'h'ich sounded li$ke a sente'nc'e.
`|` It fe[lt like a h~am~m~er had hit the bottom of my skull.
I fe_ll over.
I became disorient`ated.
I wa#s admitted to th}e hospital.
Th*e*re I could not hol!d a spoon, could not stand, and fell over a#ll the t_i_me.
They began t(o do t&es&ts, and the resuls turned out to be b:a:d, t-he artery was not allowin:g the flow of blood.
They took me to M[osc[ow, a?nd there they said that ther#e was a large purulent cyst in m%y head, and they d"id an urg[e[nt operation.
And during the ope*ration, the doctors saw a tu]mo]r b\ehind the cyst", - sa]id Kikabidze in the pr%ogram "Once Upon a Ti%me".
The t`umor turned out to b(e malignant.
Then, 37 y-e-ar-s ago, the residents o<f Tbilisi even came t~o his d=oorstep t<o say goodbye to their idol.
But t<he a&ctor ',s wi\fe did n;ot allow the living actor to b}e written off, she firmly beli\ev\ed that h~e could beat the disease and for over a year did not leave her beloved husband's bedside.
If it were no_t for Iri&na, I wou{ld not be alive now.
Whe+n I have faced emergency situations, s#h#e has always be&en there, like a roc*k", - th'e actor admitted.
T*he actor man~aged t}o beat the disease, and now he happily lives in his ho:u:se in t\he center of Tbilisi.
And from time to ti>me he de-nies rumo<rs about hi~s illness, about his untimely death, which con/tin/ua/lly appear online.
The c@reators of the w+e+b+s+ite `>` Peacekeeper" added the Hungarian Foreign Mini*s*ter Péter Szijjártó to the "P]urga]tory" section.
The reason w}a}s `_` an encroachment on the sovereignty an$d territorial integrity of Ukraine '~'.
I'n addition, the head of the MFA of the neighboring country was accused of `<` direct threats of invasion o`f Ukrain"e" and "support f%or sep^aratist sentiments i<n Ukraine", a{s w|el|l as participation "in organizing a provocation aimed at the massive violation o?f U\krai\n\i\a\n legislation by Ukrainian citizens".
Note that ahead of Szijjártó the governor of the Kiev-Pechersk L^a^vra Pavel and O*nu*fri*y, the head o_f the Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Mosc>ow Patriarchate) were pu't in th;e "Purgatory '_' section.
The r!eason was their op(position t`o receiving the Tomos by the Ukrainian local church.
Earlier, commenting on t=he issuance of Hungarian passports to Ukrain,ian citizens in Zakarpattia, the Presiden)t of Uk(ra(ine Petro Poroshenko demanded respect for the sovereign r#ights of Ukra:ine.
Authorities named the price of t.h.e “ gol_den parachute ” for th~e deputy governor o*f Voronezh.
The deputy governor of the Vor"one"zh region Yury Agibal?o?v was paid 23 monthly salaries based o~n t,he regional l|aw “ On state positions ”.
However, the actual size of t'he “ golde&n parachute ” for the official who was released fro*m the po)s)t that h[e wa>s temporarily occupying was in fact several times smaller than the sum mentio%ned in the m.edia ”
These clarifications were provid%ed to the press service of the regi#onal gove*rnmen*t.
According to the l)aw, t%h%e monthly s-alar-y on Agibaev ’ s positi"on is 11,189 roubles.
Thus, the o\ne-off paym#e#nt was 223,892 without t^he income tax, the p"r"ess service stated, not o>n>e million, as the m>ed>ia reported.
The official was r|ecei|vi|n|g pension starting fro,m July 2018.
He was at the state se$r$vice for more than ni;ne y?ear?s.
The payment and pensio$n were accrued to him a.fte.r he resigne?d, explained the regional government repre<sentative to R.IA Novosti.
The addition to the pension was\n ’ t payed when h@e was at the state position, and his sal`a`ry didn ’ t change com(par(ed to t|he pre%vio%u%s period.
Aleksandr Gusev, temporarily acting as a governor won the governor elections a_nd e`nt`ered th%e post o-n September 15.
Agibalov wa#s f$re$e$d from his job in the end of his governor te<r<m.
Other offi!cial!s at this position be-fore resigned in the s[am[e way.
On September 2}9, the Nezygar Telegram channel publ&ished document\s showing that Agibalov was payed 2,3 monthly salaries a$s h$e left the vice governor position, and two days later h-e received the same position without th"e “ acting a|s ” prefix.
State Duma de,puty urg)ed to talk to school children about the dangers of masturb-a-tion
Onishchenko holds the p#o#st of first deputy cha]irma]n of th!e committee for education a?nd science.
Based on the experience of his w)o)rk, he noted in an i#nte#r#v#iew that teenagers are provoked t/o masturbate b!y h(armf(ul information they find on the in(t(ern(et.
It ’ s worth fighting aga%i%ns%t this at t>he level of educational ins`titu`t`ions and families, the deputy ad'ded.
Gennady Onishchenko, deputy o"f the State Duma o,f the Russian F*e*dera*tion (in an int)ervi)ew with the radio station "Moscow S"peaks":
As part of t!he general sexual education of chil#dren, thi~s must be done, explaining th/e harm, because here there is a risk spe,cific to the sexu)al health of the c~hil~d, b;oth boy and girl.
The problem is ob[jective, it lies in the fa(ct that children reach pubert\y quit_e early, and then a la~r~ge discrepancy appears bet%we%en their puberty a/n/d ability to officially enter into intersexual contact.
Acco!rding to Onishchenko, "prudishness", the hushing up o%f "problems o'f a sex^ual age" and the lack of a cult.u.re of adequate parenting ar%e p(reve(ntin(g a solution to the prob.lem.
The doctor is s}ure that many teenagers enco+un+te+r masturbation.
T|he deputy bel_iev_es that the provision of l&essons about the dangers of masturbation is mo)st of all wor$t$h it in the schools of "hyper-urbanized '$' regions.
"If w\e start this conversation in o[ur Mu@sl@i@m republic, they will simply no@t u$nderstand us, to put it mi|l|dly", - said the professor.

AfD is n#o#w second by popularity in Ge#rm#any
The anti-im]m]igrant “ Alternative f`or Ge:rmany ” party set a new record f{or popularity, while Angela Merkel ’ s ratings are f}a}ll}ing.
By all accounts, Germany ’ s residents hav#e started to seriously tire of Angela Merkel ’ s immigration p(olicy, which has made the cou%n%try a desired destination f[o[r m&il&lions of r>e>fugees fro%m the Middle Eas[t.
Clearest of all on thi=s matter are the latest op>in>i>o>n polls: Alternative for G&er&many k|ee|ps gett~ing more popular, while t_he positions of Merkel and Seehofer, who head the two a"llied governing p+art+ies, are weakening.
This week the AfD set its latest record, rising t,o second p`lac`e i=n popular pref!er!ences.
At 17%, the conservatives ha.v.e managed t~o stay a(hea(d of the social democrats, who h:av:e about 1;6%.
A ga:p of one percentage point could be a~ttrib~uted t?o statistical err-or, but t|he fact still must b:e note/d that the AfD, which was established in 2013 out o[f a small group of e\co\nomists a[nd eurosceptics, was able to turn into a serious political force.
Leading in o@ve@ra@ll s(tand(ing i`s still the CDU/CSU union of parties, which has a%bout 30%.
But a fa|ll|in|g tr@end i%s still observed: I'n April, support for Angela Merkel ’ s union of par+ties was s+til+l four percentage points higher.
The German chancellor ’ s p+erson+a+l rating is falling, while she is leading th(e gove&rnme&n&t fo#r a fourth term i:n a row.
Support now for Angela Mer_k_el stands at 48%, w@hich is 7% low'er th?an last year.
We sho#uld add that after the S\oc\ial Democrats a|r|e the Greens (15%), the Lef+t (11%), an)d the Fre{e Democrat\s (10%).
T<he E)volution of the “ Alternative ”
The Alternative fo]r Germany party was founded in September 20,12 ou.t of the “ Electoral Alte`rna`tive 2013 ” group, which h`a`d take|n in former members of the C'h'r'is'tia'n Democratic Union.
The grou%p init=ially arose i\n opposition to government policy, but e,arly on it handled only economic issues, including problems with the euro a!nd interacti{on{s within the EU.
Th;e group spoke ou^t agai@ns@t German-y “ subsidizing ” weak EU economies, and didn ’ t exclude the possibility of reimburs+ing Germany and o~f a full exit from t,he European Union.
As t\h\e im_m_i_gration crisis deepe(n(ed, the AfD ’ s platform expanded.
In 2013 t"he group becam`e a full-fledged political party, whic.h occupied the Eurosceptic niche and began t&o harshly criticize the government for th#e failure of it[s immigration policy.
In the last parliamentary elections in 2017, the AfD managed to enter the Bundestag for t^he f)irs)t ti?me, ge+tting 94 s,eats (out of 70<9).
Two representatives o;f Alternative for Ge@rman@y re$cei$ve$d seats in the European Parliament.
A video was published wi_th a journalist who called the ci*t*i*z*ens of Ukraine "a na\tion of b|l|ockheads"
Th/e host of a political talk s@how on Ukrainian T$V and author o&f two books Ostap Drozdov admi[tted l'ive that he considers his compatriots to b<e a "nation of blockheads".
T'hey believe the T_V and read little.
As Drozdov n;ot;e;d, i|t i^s difficult to live and work in such a co.untry.
"From child=hood we were n)ot taught a culture of reading and a?c?cept?ance o,f te'xt's", - the journalist said.
Local nationalists immediately criticized Dr]o]zd]ov ’ s words, accusing him o<f lack of patriotis%m an^d greed.
As previously reported, the State committee f]or television and radio-broadcasting o^f Nezalezhnaya began a campaign against literature, i-n which there are the slightest hi*nts o`f criticis#m of the Kie>v authorities, banning th,e import of who&l&e 201 editions.

Canadia]ns created a c=ar to prep*a*re for the apocalypse - Behind the Wheel magazine
A@ny@o@ne who wishes can purchase t?h?i?s automobile.
The company Ro:sh:e:l De~fenc~e S|olutions announced th~at it is already receiving orders for its armored car.
Roshel Senator A;PC, armored car for the apoca#ly#ps#e
The theme of the apo"calypse is not just p+rofitab+l+e for video game makers, film stu'di'o's, an^d book publis-hers.
Now automobile companies are m#aste#ring this niche, w,hich is new t"o them.
Thus, t^h^e Canadian Ro?s?hel Defence Solutions came out with i:t:s armored car for th}e apocalypse, the Senator A.P.C.
In their time spent n}ot pursuing dreams, the engineers o.f this company mak+e armored cars for the p+ol+ice.
The Roshel Senator A\P\C is designed f,or 12 passengers, who ar,e contained i`n a fully welded ar`mored capsule tha|t lacks special comforts, but is completely secure.
This bunker (it c<ould no:t b^e called anything else, since its armor level satisfies the B7 standard) is i>ns>talled on the chas(si(s of the powe[rful Fo:rd Super Duty pickup truck.
Its bottom, also armored, can protect the ca(psule from grenade e:xplosio:ns and an!ti-personn!el l\andmines.
Interior of the Roshel Senato+r APC, ar#mor#ed ca?r for the apocalypse
In order that passengers no"t be harmed ev\en by the blast wave o;f a<n explosive detonated near t=he automobile, the interior o`f the car is equipped wit/h special shock-absorbing chairs.
Furthermore, t'he capsule ha=s an autonomous ventilation and fire-extinguishing syst{em.
For safe vision, the Roshe/l Senator APC is equip<pe<d with an omnidirectional camera system, including nightvision, as w]e]ll as a^n armored lo)okout tower on the r@o@of.

Tim$efram$e named for d#eath of the Universe
The Universe will exist for approximately 14&0 billion more years, w|hi|c|h is 10 times mo~re than th^e age o!f the obser$ved world, equal t~o about 13.8 billion years.
Resea/rc/h of an inte[rna[t[ion[a[l collective of scientists was publishe:d i?n a li-bra-ry of electronic preprints and s~ent for p_u_b_l_ica_t_i_on i>n the journal Publications of the Astronomical Society of Japan, reports the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun.
Expe]rts arrived a#t si}mil}ar c(onc(lus(ions by using the HSC (Hype"r Suprime-Cam) camera of the Subaru telescope to observe about ten million galaxies.
Tracing the distribution of dark matter and d)a)rk energy, which a[ccou[nt fo{r more than 9|5 percent of the energy mass of the obse@r@ved world, scient"ists, wor|king within the stand#ard cosmological model Λ}CD}M (Λ Cold Cold Matt_er), est+imated the rate of expansion of the Universe, which turned o]ut to be a little slower than previously th:ought.
A press release from the Obse"rvator"y Subaru notes tha<t the observations provided a detailed three-dimensional map of t"he distribution of matt=er i)n the Universe, and the recording of da&t&a from the European space telescope Planck clarified the re[s[t[ricti[o[ns im<posed on t+he parameters o-f ΛCDM.
I>n July s=cie=nti=sts modeled t{he possible death of the Universe.
Three years earlier their colleagues presented new conclus@ions su@pport@ing the view that the observed worl>d wi^ll end i_ts existence in 2.2 billion years as a result of the Big R`i`p.
Another attem#pt fails to unite the initiators of th\e pe!ns!i!on referendum
The opportunity to elicit the public's opinion about pe.n.si.on re!form h"as been postponed indefinitely
A meeting of the nationwide initiative group for a referendum again;s;t raising the retirement age wa<s h[e[ld in Mosc_ow on Saturd:ay.
Representatives of 13 sub+grou+ps to:ok part in th#e meeting, putting forward proposals for the wording of que_sti_ons (in total, the C"EC registered five q#uesti#ons).
They decided to app^l^y to the Central Electoral Commission to register a s`ingl`e initiative group an\d as\k t"he public t`he question: "Are you in favor of the pension ag[e, as established b]y legislation a+s of July 1, 2&01&8, at which Russian citizens ga&in the right to an old-age pen\sion, not being increased?"
This wording was registered by the Vologda subgroup, whose repre?se?nta?ti?v?e?s did not part@icip@ate in t]he meeting, but it was considered the simple_s_t an?d legall"y most succinct.
Most o*f the meeting participants were supporters of the Fair Russ-ia m+embe+r Ilya Sviridov (s^ix subgroups) and th\e Communist Party of the Russia{n Federat=ion (four subgroups).
They wer,e joined b-y three independent subgroups from Nizhny Novgor%od, Voronezh and Orenburg.
Earlier, S>viri>dov told Vedomosti that invitations wer<e s_e_nt to a:l:l the initiators, and representatives o?f about 40 su\b\groups expressed their agreement to take part.
But, fo`r example, Marina Seme+nova, wh)o heads the Vologda su~bgr~o~up (the wording of her question was supported by another 15 subgroups), told Vedomosti that she did not receive an i@nvi@tatio@n and did n`ot plan to take part: "I_t was not clear wh+o our f=riend was an]d wh&o o&ur enemy".

I`n the mat\ch between Lokomotiv and Akhmat, Turbin's e'rr'or's rained do`wn fast and furious
Forme%r all-^u^ni^on referee Vladimir Lev[itin commented on the performance of referee Evgeny Turbin i#n t'he match of t%he 9th round o,f the Russian championship between Lokomotiv and Akhmat and assessed the controve^rsia^l incidents of the game.
"`How would you assess Evgeny Tur>bin's refereeing i^n the match between Lokomotiv and Akhmat? '*'
`;` I b=el=ie=v=e that the ref|eree confirmed that he is not suitabl)e for refereeing matches in the Ru;ssian Premier League.
It surprises me t'hat with t@he mess in the fifth r+ound game between Spartak and Di(n(amo, neither Turb<in himself, nor the heads of Dinam=o drew any serious conclusions about his l/ack of a{bi{l{ities.
The r(esult had a quick impact on t~he nint>h round: errors in hi-s performance an,d missed calls on b.ad tackles rained down fast and furious.
For example, in the 50th minute, Locomotiv '$s E?d?er pushed over Akhm_ata defender Rodo+lf+o i{n his own penalty area.
Just ei(ght met"ers from the goal line, bu+t Turbin did not ca:ll a penalty".
"How would you assess th*e incident w-ith the participation of Id>ow>u, who in the 82nd minut$e appeared to handle t^he ball?"
"I believe the defender deliberately han+dle+d t$he bal@l in his own penalty area.
T$urb$i$n was clos!e to t[h[e incident, had a good view of it, and his assistant w=as to t]he right.
This incident s,hould have bee.n seen b'y the fourth official Sergey Karasev.
How*ever, none of the three referees did not s>ee it, an=d no penalty w-as awarded.
Therefore, the sco)re was corrupted, an;d any sporting justice was r_i_ppe_d up.
I)t was a ca@s@e in which refereeing by th.e rules w%as ousted and the sporting spirit of t.he game buried".
"In the 5@2nd minute, Turbin did no<t dare to send off defender Oleg Ivanov, who commited a foul i|n a duel with Kryc:ho:wi:ak, an<d when the r;e;f;er;ee showe"d him a yellow card, he defian|tly applauded hi{m.
What d(o you think of this inc:ide:nt?
W$as it necessary to brandi%sh the second yellow card? '&'
"In th^is i>nci>dent Turbin brandished the first yellow card in somewhat spuri$ous circumstances.
A second w=ou=ld have b)een logic".
"Oleg Ivanov talked aft:er t:he matc_h about refereeing double standards in that some teams are awarded a p<ena<lt<y for such violations, as in the inciden)t wi$th I]dowu, and others are not.
How wo?uld you ass&ess the player's words?"
"It depends on how yo~u interpret doubl|e standards.
It was a p!e!nalty.
But i/t wasn't gi;ven.
So the refer)e)e did not give a second penalty i%n the opposition goa%l.
That wa#s the principle applied h+er+e.
And the second incident wit%h double standards is that th'e r(efer(ee l[o[oks at who is playing.
On Saturday Locomotiv and Akhma\t played, an~d there have been serious complaints about Tur'bin's perfo-rmance, because t"h"e team was put at a disadvantage ';'.
Saturday N/ight Live started wit*h Matt Damon playing Judg^e Kavanaugh, who has been accuse%d of rape.
Matt Damon played U<S Supreme Court ap@point@e@e Brett Kavanaugh, wh~o is accu$s$e$d of rape.
Damon appeared i{n the first episode of th<e new sea]son of NBC ’ s Sat-u-rd-a-y Night Live.
In a sh$ort skit, the a-ctor played Kavanaugh at the Senate hearin^g^s where he is accused of r]a]p]e.
Earlier, the Supre.me Court appoi%ntee attracted attention with h(is emot`ional and detailed accounts du.ring discussions with Senator Amy Klobuchar.
So, Kavanaugh repeatedly admitted to his love f<or beer, but stated that h~e had nev*er drunk to the p:o:i:nt of me;mory lapses.
In addi;t;i;on, i.n hi's attempt to vi<ndicate himself f]rom the rape accusation, Kavanaugh stated that in those years he had been a v"irgin.
Dam.on al"so played these details up.
“ Al=l I did wa*s drink lots of b#e#er, and I was`n ’ t thinking a^t all about sex.
I was t~he pr'oudest, drunk<e<st virgin that anyone ever saw.
Everyone knows that, ” said the judge a?s play`e`d b_y Matt Damon.
E]arli]er Kav=a=na=ugh was c}onfi}r}m}ed as a judge for the US Supreme Court.
Barbra Streisand discovered str(ang(e behavior in her cloned d[o[gs
American singer Barbra Streisand said that th>e clones of her dead dog behave completely d%iffe%r%en%tly from t[he original pe{t.
"They a<re n:ot alike.
In fact, [the clon#es] loo<k like h+er, but cloning the soul i,s impossible," emphas'ized the 76-year-old singer.
At t@he end of 2017 Streisand ordered two clones of her 14-year-old dog o}f t'he Coton du Tulear breed named Samantha, wh-ich h^ad t=o be put to sleep due to health pr-oblems.
I/n July 2018 it was reported that a dog of the chihuahua breed named Mir%ac%le Mil~l~y, which was named the smallest d/og in t/he w-orld, had been c*loned for the 49th time.
Specialists are engaged in cloning the s=ix-y=e=ar-o=ld animal in an attemp(t to unders~tand why it is so sm@all.
The United States has contempl}a}ted a na|val blockade of Russian deliveries of oil a,nd gas
The United States could be^gin a naval blockade of Russia in order to obta^in a`n adva?ntage o`n the global energy market.
The US government is so eager to f&ight for success on the global hy&droca&rbon market that i)t is prepared t-o resort to a naval b]l]oc]kade of Russia, which r+emains one o;f the worl$d ’ s main suppliers of f'uel's.
U.S Department of t:he Interior head Ryan Zinke spoke yesterda]y of th&e possibility of a naval blockade.
Unlike other si`m`ilarly named government agenci-e-s around the world, the department conducts no#t police fu,nc,tions, but c>ivilian ones, and th\is includes carrying out policy in the area of natural resou*rces.
For th^is reason, Zinke ’ s announcement falls entirely within h=i=s sphere o;f responsibility, tho}ugh not without political overtone&s.
Appearing at an industrial event in Pittsburg, Z)inke stated that with i-ts naval forces t;he U`S controls shipping lanes i;n the Middle East and could block them if t~he need a@r@o@se.
Zinke ’ s words co_uld lead to t]he conclusion that the need may b[e tie&d t%o Washington ’ s desire to interf%ere with Russian deliveries o.n the global energy market.
Zinke me@ntion@ed that Ru|s|sia stil)l received the lion ’ s share o{f its income from world oil an)d gas deliveries.
H{e s[aid h\e is sure that a desire to distribute energy shipments in the Middle East as well as Easter)n Europe was t#he prime motive fo]r Moscow ’ s expansion in th;is region.
T/he agency head mad_e it clear that t>h>e US is still considering maintaining its leadership on the glo/bal energy market, now that it has become t"he large)st supplier o{f oil and gas.
Fo?r this, Washington will have t?o put confine Russia and Iran, and Z*i*nke considers a nav#al b&lock&ade of co+mmerci+al routes to be an acceptable me:ans to this end.

Expensive violin p~a~ssed ont-o a pawnshop for pittance
When a ma*n brought a vi\oli\n t:o a L`BC Boutique an.d Loan pawnshop located i[n the city of Somer+vill+e, Massachusetts, the pawnshop worker of=fered only USD 50 for the old and flimsy-looking instrument.
But an experienced store manager, Dyla(n McDermmitt, suspected that it was i&n fact an old and expe&n&si&ve instrument, and h.e decided t_o consult with a_n expert for an ap<p<ra<isal.
It w(as the$n discovered that the violin was made in 1<759 by the famous Italian violin maker Ferdinando Gagliano an$d i%s es"ti"m"ated to be worth USD 250,000.
The bows a(lone f&or s_uch violins are valued at USD 16,000–18,000.
An investigation reve$a$led that th?e vio?lin ha[d recently been stolen from one of the resid<ents of the city, and the instrument was then returned to its ri[ghtful owner.
It is not yet known how the person wh<o so(ld the violin to the pawnshop obt(a(ined t=he instr<ume<nt, but it is known that th:e seller had no c}riminal background.
The manager sa#ys that now everyone who brings a violin t@o the pawnshop will b<e asked to play i[t to make sure that it really belongs t}o the;m.
E*xciti*ng clash await+s fans in ninth ro{un{d of Russian Premier League Spartak wi]ll take o-n Rostov a^t its stadium in T!u!shino under the lead_ership o|f Valery Karpin, a man who, as we know, i+s no stranger to the “ people's team ”.
The fact t|ha|t the clubs currently ha{ve an equ%al number of points (15 each), occupy 3rd and 4th places in the standings, lagging behind Zenit (which ha\s a distant lead) and o#n#ly o/n/e point ahe,a,d of Dynamo, makes th~is m_atch particularly sign|ifica|nt.
The red-and-whites are going through a rough patch: th?e club is again plagued by idiotic scanda)ls . M*assim*o Carrera's team also unexpectedly took a beating at t'he hands of SK Ra!pid Wi!e!n in the UEFA Europa Leag%ue, a(nd they recently l+os+t to Akhmat Grozny at ho%me.
After the ma\t\c\h with CS#KA Moscow, which ended in a fair draw, Spartak wa&s ab@le t+o b<e<at Ch_ornomorets Odesa with a minimum score and n'o't without some difficulty in the championship . It is still too early to sa_y whether t#he most popular cl$ub in Russia has managed its way out of it^s crisis.
For thr`ee game_s in a row Rostov has not been ab!l!e to win, but it has gone undef=eated now for five matc%he%s.
L^et's se-e whether Karpin will be ab+le to extend his team's winning streak by winning such a key match t-hat they ca_n not afford to l@ose.
The previous meet!i!ng between Karpin '-s Rostov an,d Spartak ended in victory for the c"ap"it"al team.
The start of th=e matc#h is set for 7:,00 PM.

But the biggest of them is Russia, which is expanding it#s mi{litar{y p$resence i,n Ukraine a:nd the Arctic region.
Mosc"o"w immediately contested these allegations by weste"rn politicians, reports TAS?S.
Then the Br'iti's'h Foreign Secre\tary Jeremy Hunt noted that Russia would pay a h:igh price if it flouts international rules and us-es chemical weap[ons.

One of the first t;o vote was Prime M@inist@er Zoran Zaev, an ar'de'nt supporter of renaming the republic Nor;th;ern Mace=donia.
Th{e pr.e.par.atio.ns for the referend+um and today's voting are being monitored by interna.tio.nal organizations.
The h?ead of the observation mission of the Office for Democratic Ins_ti_t_ution_s and H\u\man Rights, Jan Pet/erse/n, told Euronews how t'he work of the observers is org+anized:
Approximately 100 t"e"ams dispersed across the country today t:o observe the entire process, fr\om the opening of pol"l"i"ng st!ati!ons to their closure, then the counting o:f votes a)nd the drawing up of rep]orts.
During the month, 10 of our tea`ms worked in t{he country, and the!y oversaw th/e preparation for the v<oting, the work of the media, the observance o?f the law on c#am#pai#gn financing a;nd the organization of t\he referendum.
Fei Dul[ger[i: `_` About 5(00 foreign observers are closely monitoring the voting process.
Groups o>f observers are recor?ding the events in detail and communicating with members o.f election commissions, in order to su$bs$eque$n$tly put t]h]e information down in t"he final re,port".
A=n interpreter c_ompare_d Russian and German mentality
Russians and Ge<rmans ha>ve differe]n]t mentality but th\ese differences don ’ t prevent them from understanding each other.
Berbel Sakse, a pro<f<ess<iona<l simultaneous in!te!r!p!re!ter, related this on th&e International Da`y of the Translator o~n September 30.
Berbel S(aks is engaged more than 30 years in the translations from the Ru;s;si;a;n an"d Engli(s(h languages.
Germans l"ike to plan quietly event!s, a~nd Russians, as they sa/y in a proverb, "long harness a~nd quickly go".
B{ut it seems to me, f=or m^utual understanding between t$he p}eople a;n;d for work of the translator it doesn't play a m$ajor role, ” she said i'n the interview to RIA Novosti.
According to the interpreter, “ i,t i*s enough to know history ” to und_ersta_nd that the countries can ’ t d?o without each ot"h"e"r
In the fu!ture, Sakse noted, there ’ s np se'nse for Germany to ign@ore Ru!s!sia.
Russia i?s a natu'ral part of Europe, there ’ s no sense i_n ignoring i>t.
We need Russian gas, oi'l, th?e?re are a lot o'f things that define our common destiny, ” s.he sai%d.
A day before the German chancellor Angela Mer|k|el claimed that t"he country trie*s to “ start relationships ” wi#th Russia and su|stain them.
Especially important, she said, it t'he N~ord Stream - 2 project constructed from t>h>e Russian c`oas`t to Germany on the bottom o'f the Baltic s#ea.

Pu(t(i(n appointed a n&ew head of the P}reside}n}tial Foreign Policy Directorate
Vladimir Putin b|y d#ecree relieved A^lexand^er Manzhosin of duties as head of the Presidential Foreign Policy Direc&torate.
I$n his place, Ivor Neverov was ap@poin@ted t'o this post.
Mr. Ma!n!zho!sin ha#d headed t@h@e Presidential Foreign Policy Directorate since 2004.
As one of th>e reaso|ns for his departu@re a source cl-o-se to the Kremlin named personal circumstances, noting th>at th?ere were no substantial complaints ab\out th[e quality of his work as head of the directorate.
Ig\or Neverov previously headed the Se-cond European De"p"ar"tm"en"t of the Foreign Ministry

Russians donated one ru>ble for a deputy w]ith low pay
In Y[ekaterinburg the charitable f}und Chelovechek opened a collection of fun]d]s for State Duma deputy Vera G?anza, who complained about l~ow pay.
The p\rogress of the c_am_paign can be followed on t.he site of the organization.
"Th\e Chelovechek charitable f%und expresses hope that we as the whole world c>an s~av~e this public servant.
W*e ask all empathetic pe'opl'e to gif}t a chance at life and a happy f>u>ture!
All c[oll[ecte[d funds will b;e give?n personally into the hands of the poor person.
God Save Y$o$u!" say!s a message of t}he fund.
In total the b`enefactor wants to collect 380 thousand rubles fo"r the depu!ty, w*hich i+s the equivalent of a month's pay.
Accounts of help rec|ei|v|ed a^re published on th+e fund's page in VKontakte, wh)ere the o_rg_aniza_tion posts screenshots of money transfers.
Th>e most frequent sums of dona{ti{ons are one r!uble and 50 kopecks.
At the time of publ\i\c\a\t\i\on Russians ha~d dona-te-d to Vera Ganza 1633 rubles.
The collection o!f funds started on 28 September af>te>r Ganza's complaints of a l>ow level o>f income.
In her w'ords, the a{verag{e pay of a deputy is 380 thousand rubles, f[ro[m w]hich nothing is left o?ver, so it is necessary to spend money wi@th a credit c,ard.
Ganza complained that parl%iament%a%ria%ns are n$ot compensated for expenses.
After this i-n the Duma it was announced that th,e possibility of reimbursing e>xpenses would b-e considered.
The f!ilm "Between Two Waters" was awarded the "Gold.en Shell"' at t~he festival in San Sebastian
The film "Betw}een T[wo Waters" (Entre dos aguas) b@y the Sp!anish director Isaki Lacuesta was recognized as the best film of the 66th International Film Fes"tival in S%an Se[bast[ia[n.
The film won th=e mai>n award of the festival - the `]` Gold;en Shell".
The No.rw.egian actress Pia Tjelta was awarded t=he "Silver She*ll" for b"est actress in the film "Blind Spot ']' (B?lind Spot).
The best actor was named the Argentine Da&r&i&o Grandinetti for th-e film "Red '}' (Roj}o).
The dire?c?tor o]f t~ha~t film, Benjamin Naishtat, was awarded the title of best direc=tor.
Th*e comedy N>i>ght School topped the American box office.
T.he comedy Night Sch*ool, w<hich debuted last F*ri*day at Am)erican movie theaters, earned $28 million on its first weekend in distribution.
This success allo_wed the unimaginative flick starring Kevin Hart and Tif]fany Haddish t*o t=op th#e US box office for 28-30 September.
Released so f*ar in only 20 countries, th=e f|ilm brought in $5.!5 million, including $2 million fro,m British viewers.
In it,s fight for first place, what ’ s remarkable is that this creatio%n of Malcolm Lee p<r<etty clearly got a+head o|f an$o$ther newcomer in weste(rn distr>i>bu>ti>on, the cartoon Smallfoot, a curious st-or-y of a charm#ing yeti meeting a representative of humankind, whose existence the starring character had never believ;e;d i:n.
This project of directors Kare,y Kirkpatrick and Jason Reisig collected $23 mi_llion on its kickoff weekend, ba/sical/ly justi*fying the exp)ectatio)ns o+f experts who had predicted $20-25 mill{i{on for the weekend.
Regarding Sm_allfoot ’ s total box-office receipts, at th(e m(ome(nt they amount t!o $38.6 milli?on (wh:ile i`t has debuted already in 5|0 countries): Its most active market was Mexico, filling t(he coffers with $3.6 million.
The top three a]t the time was c@omple@ted with the children ’ s ta-l-e “ The Ho[use with a Clock in I^ts Wal|ls, ” from horror master Eli Roth . Thi)s proves conclusively that the director can produce qu=ality m<ov<ies for the 12+ au-d-ience too.
For it%s second week in distribution, the scr"e"en adaptation of Joh`n Bellairs ’ bo`ok with the charming Jack B+l+ack and Cate Blanchett earned $12.5 milli(on, bringing tot)al global receipts to $5^3.^8 million.
In spite of its departure fr'om the t;o;p 3, the thriller A Si!m!ple F~avor, with B<lake Lively and Anna Kendrick, continues to be an incr&e&di&ble s~urpr~is~e: T>he m#o#vie was not r_eal_ist_icall_y expected to perform well f~inanc~ia~l~ly, but during 17 days in d^ist^ribution in America this movie b{y Paul Feig collecte>d $43 million (including $6.6 million for 28-30 October). And ri|ght now it actually h`as $62.9 million in total sale)s.
Th@e last of the to[p five this week was the horror s%h%ow T!he Nu$n, which raked in $5.4 mill`ion in the reporting period.
During 24 days i?n American (and of course other) theaters, the spin-off f#ilm The Conjuring h.as total earnings o!f $3)3)0 million and now prou)dly bears the title of mos^t successful franchise movie . T$he franchise als)o includes the two parts of The Conjuring a`nd th"e two films about th@e terrifying doll Annabelle.
The r(esu(lt(s of the past weekend show t=hat right after th"is Corin Hardy horror mov~ie com!e!s one mor|e from that genre, t#he newly-appeared Hell Fest, which is one of the ma|jor youth horrors of the year.
On its first weekend the mov,ie ear-ne-d $5,.,1 million in th>e U*S . I.t is the brainchild of the famous film editor and now director Gregory Plotkin, wh~o has previously worked on a s%et of bi'g ho.r.ro.r projects including Happy Death Day, which Hell Fest i(n some parts strongly resembles.
The result i`s extremely positive whe{n compared t\o the film ’ s modest budget.
T'he seventh w}as Crazy Rich Asians ($4.15 million), which seems unlikel`y t_o fa)ll out of the Ame|r|i|can box office top 10 . The romantic come`d`y has now be*en on screen for seven weeks, and for September i,t ’ s t.he sixth-highest-grossing film o%f the genre in histo_ry, with $165.7 million.
That ’ s exactly the a>moun>t the mo;vie h-as earned so far on the dome"sti"c market; its total re,ven,u,e i!s now $218.8 million.
The last three of the U]S top ten b[y reven$u$e for 28-30 September we-re T~he Predator, White Boy Rick, a<nd Peppermint — last weekend they e[ar[ned $3.7 million, $2.38 m.ill.ion, and $1.1 m.illion, respectively.
W{e ’ ll add that next weekend in the US, t^he long-awaited Ve}n}om with Tom Hardy wi%ll b;e in full swing . I[t will with`out a doubt take over the leading position in the Ameri.can box office on the first weekends of Octo\ber.
Of th.e other premiere"s of th|e coming week, the mus,i,c,al dram?a A Star I>s Born deserves special mention . This movie by Brad%l%ey Cooper w-on at the Venice Film Festival . And a`lso the crime drama The Hate U Give.

I"n the game, perhaps, G'o'd h^e^lped Sib`ir today, because they ma+de bad mistakes, especially our leaders.

"T}h}is is ugly nepotism '#'
The audience is outraged by the choice of A*g*uti*n on the s#how `\` Voice"
T$he viewers of the s|how `"` Voice 60+" accus+e the me$ntor Leonid Agutin of "ugly nepotism and brazen sham".
When in blind auditi&ons he reco=gniz=ed the v_oice of his fa,ther Nikola'y Agutin from the first notes, many hoped that h}e would r#emain neutral and not turn to the performer.
B^ut filial feelings took over, a(nd he picke_d a relative for his team.
Th?en m[a[n[y considered it a joke, but forgave the mentor bia#s a`t the first stage.
But th$e "jok_e" dragged o}n, and the star's fath@e@r absolutely unjustifiably took the place o}f more worthy performers.
And now t=he viewers are not ready to forgive Agutin f}o}r suc[h an injustice.
Yesterday we, th*e viewers o*f t:he show, w=ere outraged b'y nepotism by the ugly and frank dragging our close relatives onto the fina?l ladder.
I even doubted that Agutin had the stamina an"d sense of conscience to not drag his d$ad to the end all the w%a%y to first place", - discuss)e)d Irina Petrovskaya a<nd Kse?ni?a L&arin&a i"n the pr|ogram "Person from the TV".
Meanwhile, for the sake of his father, Leon&id Agutin "ejected" won\de\rful performers who actually sang, w\hile Nikolai Petrovich whispered a touching so[ng about hi_s mother, explaining tha{t t\he viewers still want t;o see his fa/ther in the show.
Bu&t, a{s it turned out, this is not at all the cas:e; the viewers want an objective asse]ss]me]nt and to see genuinely talented performers in t@h@e final, and n%o%w Agu>tin has discredited the sh&ow.
"I sym'pathi'ze w:it:h the participants o$f "Voice" from the Agutin t+eam - they were doomed".
`{` Last time, Agutin showed how h^e loves his dad, but t=oday he had to prove himself as a profession&al '>'.
"T-he competition has lost its meaning '|'.
"Re;move two talent|ed people f`r`om the project and leave your father i~n the project who does not sing but whispe,rs, h"ow do yo.u call a mentor after this? ",
`'` You lik!e how your d^ad s;in;gs, then organize a concert in the Kr_emli_n with your money and see how many people come t\o this concert".
Th~is i^s the show "Voice", and n+ot the show "Bi#g Shot Relatives".
`~` On t^he part o!f Agutin, this was unprofessional".
"Then y&ou have to offer dad to perform o-n your ow-n sh=ow, and not on a show that i:s made with the money o&f Channel 1".
"This was a r*ea*l chance f$or someone, and he took som_eon_e '=s place.
And I don ’ t understand why th-e voiceless d!ad should ev&oke a greater appreciation tha\n any ot.h.er participant with real vocal skills.
Why was the worker from Surgut w\i\th a magnificent voice and timbre ejected, and A^gu^tin '*s father brought t?o th!e finals?
And then we all com.plain that f%or decades the;re are the same faces o$n the stage an.d on the screens!
Y?es, because you ca(n no{t break through nepotism!"
"What di&d you ex=pect?
This i\s Russia!
C}ro}ny}is}m and nepotism everywhere.
An`d the mo+ney in the family budget will c}ome in handy!
The the,ater o!f the absurd continues!"
Th=e users a[lso recalled that in one of t_he seasons of the tra=dition=al "Voice", the so|n of Gradsky took part in b'li'nd auditions.
T(he(n i[n n_o way d\id it occur to the mentor to take his son into his own team.
Moreover, h+e said: "C<ome o@n, get out o#f here, everything is clear".
Agutin could no@t act li:ke a professional.
Canadian military s[erva[n[t[s are granted permission to wear beard]s for ra,is,in,g the spirit

S=tart=i=ng tomorrow, Russia is starting to issue fin>e>s for violations in the fi^eld o?f shared construction, r~e~p~orts channel "Russia 24".
Companies a}nd bureaucrats are thr!eat!ened with the punishment if they do no=t timely submit dat]a on a building under construction t~o the Uniform Housing Construction Inform_ation System.
Th#i#s innovation will help those who decided to p#urchase an apartment i-n a new building, but are worried about t{he dev~e~loper going bankrupt.
Thi;s was discussed at a conference in Saint P~etersburg for representatives of the const/ruc/tio/n indu<stry.
Due t[o amendments to the law on shared h}o}usin}g, d-evel-opers must be fulled credited i}n a bank.
Many experts have already started talking about a pot=e=n=t=ial sh^a^r^p price increase f/o/r apartments.
Ho?wever, as it turns out, not ever-yone agrees wi?t?h this.
In the center of Kiev, a robber threat)ene)d a man with a knife, forc)ing him t!o withdr?aw mone[y from an ATM.
Th$e incident occurred on the evening of September 29 on th\e street Iva^na Kudri, reported cit\y l!aw enforcement officers.
According to the victim, the unknow#n person approached him and initiated a conversation, b&ut the]n suddenly grabbed a knife and demanded he gi\ve him mo\ney and hi_s mobile p`hone.
Since th?e victim had n*o cash, the stranger ordered him to withdraw money with h[is bank ca!rd.
After the a|tta|cker rece(i(ved 4 thousand hryvnias and the telephone, h.e hit th$e victim and disappeared", - th\e report says.
The law e;nforcement agen?cies managed to detain th]e robber, he was a 25-year-old fro_m Kiev.
He now faces up to seven yea+rs in pr^i^s^on.
A.l.so, t>he police are working o&n a line of enquiry of the attacker '$s involvement i$n other similar crimes.

The head of the Space Research Insti_tu_te of the Russian Academy o>f Sciences, associate member of the Russian Academy of Sciences Anatoly Petrukovich talked t\o RIA Novosti abou%t a possible research program for Rus=sian cosmonauts t%o t*he M[o[on.
According to hi=m, the scientific com`m`unity i{s now developing directions for such activities.
"There i`s n&o consolidated opinion ye~t", - the scientist emphasized.
He noted t+hat one o=f the options is to place a low-frequency radio tel#esc#ope o(n the f-ar side of th}e Moon, wh^ich would help to avoid interference that originates from the Earth.
"Th^is is the only pla&ce where such a telesc:o:pe can be deployed t&o res;earch cosmic sources of radio waves ']', - Petrukovich added.
He also believes th%at the Moon co!uld be used f\or testing r]obot]ics, to use local resources for construction.
In addition, cosmonauts should b@e engaged in the search for primitive orga?n?i?c matter on the Eart_h ’ s s+atell+i+te, t%he scientist believes.
This co/uld help u{s work out how life comes into being on planet's.

Offended c*ustome*r dumps basket with feces at the 7-E$leven store
Damian Simms, a 41-year-old resident o'f St. Petersburg, F<lo<rida, harbored a grudge against the manager of a 7{-Ele{v{en 24-hour conve$nie$nc$e store: in May Simms was ejected from the st]o]r]e by t:h:e manag;er for inappropria{te behavior.
So Si)mms decided to g(et back at hi*s enemy in an original way.
At half p_as_t one in t]h]e morning, he entered the store a'nd dumped the contents of the basket that h_e brought with him pa;rtl;y on the floor a,s we>ll as partly o<n the products on the shelves.
The basket contained feces and urine, which Simms "borrowed '(' fr|om a ne<arby porta to|ilet.
Police who a)rrived at the scene of the incident arrested th]e `,` avenger."
He was booked into jail and was released b_y posti/ng b]ail o(f USD 300 pending trial.
He was charged with unlawful trespassing onto another person's property and a cri\m\i\nal of,f,ense, a@nd he was a(lso forbidden to enter t{he store again or t>o approach the man]ag]er.
A&lthoug&h Simms's cr%im%e seems mo_re ridiculous than serious, his court sentence could be quite har+sh, since h$e is a repeat offender: he has been charged with gra+nd larceny, robbery, illegal possession o]f a w~ea~pon, drunk dri:vi:ng, and an.i.ma.l abuse.

Tarp%ishev said the removal o]f Glu~shakov and Eshchenko from the starting lineup of Spartak was abs}urd

Carrera ’ s actions were a=bs=olutely a-bsurd.
T+o pay attention to things like that i*s ut%t%e%r stupidity.
I absolutely d;isagre;e with what Carrera is do^ing.
It only deepens the d(is(cord o&n the team.
And first of al"l, it was just po+em+s . You c,an i\nterpret them any way you like.
If I we:re in Ca{rrer{a ’ s place I wouldn ’ t h=av=e reacted at a|ll.
Af+t+er all, ev~ery~on~e has their own opinion.
And second, every(b(o(dy wa}nts to brag.
If Glushakov an:d Es>hchenko post “ lik_es, ” that doesn ’ t mean they hav`e something a\g\ain\s\t the trainer.
I thi[nk t{hat Italian isn ’ t fle/x/ible enough in his perception of t}he situation.
And that doesn ’ t help create a positiv_e atmosp%her%e o=n the team.
Spar-ta-k does;n ’ t have a game today, so there ’ s n"o reas^o^n to blow t'hi's whole thing out of proportion.
Maybe h;e s#hould have just laughed with them ab;o;ut it.
There ’ s a lot about S_partak that isn ’ t right . They haven ’ t gotten t]h]e]ir ac.t together after th`e y.ou.ng.er players came on the te(am.
“ Judging f#rom all of th$is, ” Tarpishev i:s sure that “ this isn ’ t boos_ting optimism before the g^am^e . ”
The two teams will play on 30 S;eptember starting a+t 7:00pm Moscow t_ime.

The l:e:c:tu:re w`as published on t.h.e “ Sirius ” site.
The school students learned t|h|a|t modern technologies need a l&ot o\f energy.
Al;ternative so#urce#s can ’ t produce this amount of energy ye=t.
Nature-like t%ech%nol%ogies t;hat are being developed by th^e young scientists, will solve t,h,is problem, s|ay the forum ’ s organisers.
Apart from this Kova?lch?uk ta=lked about risks and responsibility when develop~ing nature-like technologies.
“ The advent of su-ch t.e.ch.nology is a u+nique phenomenon and a huge benefit.
They mea_n an explosion in medical technologies, improvement o:f t)he life qualit!y and infrastructure.
But there i,s another s{ide.
Development of na@ture-l@ike technologies is in fac$t reproducing the live nature ’ s s{ys{tems.
The+r+e is a&not&her side - it is an intended interference in t)h)e m+an ’ s life.
Risks ar,e everywhere.
When a c*a*r a@p@p@eare@d, people started dying under i?t?s wheels.
But we sti#l#l u!s!e cars.
All t|echnolog|ies are double-sided.
When I a>m creating a med|ical technology, I may be at t^he same time creating a weapon of mass dest/ruc/tion, said the scientist ci"ted by R=E=N TV.
After the fil@m screening an)d dis`cussio`n about the recent scientific achievements, the stud\ents asked questions to the participants of th$e meeting.
The speakers were the candidate of physics and mathematics, head of K)urc)hatov complex of nature-like te:c:hnol:o:g:ie:s Yulia Dya,ko,va and t)he head of Nan&o- Bio- Info- C,o,gniti,ve an\d S/oci/al sciences and technologies (NBICS) complex o|f Kurchatov institute Vyacheslav Demin.
T;he education centre “ Sirius ” in Sochi was created by the education foundation “ T-alan-t and success ” o#n t%he basis of the Oly{mpics i|n|frastru|ctu|re a!t the instruction of president Vladimir Putin.

Russian submarine Kazan frig"hte"ned USA
The greatest danger f<or t_he f"leet of the USA is posed by the Russian su%bmarine Kazan.
S}o said American Rear Admiral Dave Johnson, Rosbalt reports citing T\he N)at)ional Interest.
“ W*e ’ l+l be facing tough potential opponents.
On$e only ha=s to look at the Severodvinsk," he said, pointing a~t a predecessor mode!l of the Ka!zan.
In the op|inion of the com$m$an$der of US Naval Forces Eu|ro|pe James Foggo, Russia has concentrated its efforts on mod}e}rnizing its submarine f"leet.
Macedonia: t'he referendum failed due to the lo-w turnout
The re?fe?r?endum was int"ended to endorse the agreement of the authorities in Athens and Sk/op/je to ren:am:e the Balkan country t+o `,` Northern Macedonia".
Greece objected t.o the use by the Macedonians o}f the name o%f its historical pr[ovi[nce.
T#he renaming offered prospects fo'r t*he former Yugoslav R=epublic to open a way to NATO and later the EU.
But, a;s the EFE agency reports, the just 3"4% tu@rn@out at the Sunday plebiscite "did not reach" the co*nst*itutio*n*al th;reshold o`f 50%.
However, s#ince th(e referendum was only advisory i`n nature, th{e a;uthorities in Skopje may decide not to reject the renaming.
Speaking soon after t(he closure o/f the polling stations, the prime mi'nis'ter of Macedonia Zoran Zaev, a supporter o$f changing the nam^e of t,he republic, said that if among the votes ca=st there a#r#e more `$` yes" votes, then Macedoni'a wil!l change its name, despite the quorum n}ot reached.

Reside.n.ts of Kemerovo outraged by flock of sheep i#n cemetery
O|n September 30, a message w`as posted on a frequented s>ocial network pag#e devoted to Kemerovo by an eyewitness stating that livestock freely ro)a)m one of th;e loca{l cemeteries.
A fairly large sized h!erd of animals has been browsing bet<w<een t?h?e f*e*nces and are eating the grass.
Commentators expressed various opinions: some local residents noted th[at a fe[w livestock in the small cemetery c$aus$es n~o har/m t|o anyone, and t&heir app|et|ite could even help cle|ar the area of we:eds and mow the gr=ass . Nevertheless, some residents of the city are not enamored of the animals.
O>ne outraged resident o$f Kemerovo posted (s*t*yle preserved): "Th'is i/s a burial place, not a pasture.
Sheep ha:ve no bus"iness being there.
Of course, y=ou c/an't say that the sheep are comm^it^i^ng a%n act of blasphemy, but that's not the point . '+'
In any event, one o:f the e'ye'witnesses noted that the pr/oblem of the presence of the animals in t[he middle o[f the cemetery is already k;nown, and the nec~e~ssary measures will b(e taken soon.
'|Davl|e|t ’ (to exer_t pre}s}s}ur}e) or 'dovlet' (to loom over) - which i^s correct?
The word '@dav@let' does not exi+s+t.
'D}o}vle}t' is correct.
The w;or;d `%` d\avlet" with the meanin&g of "d!r!a!w towards, exert influence, a+n impact" exists only phonetically, because w|e hear th>e sound [a] instead of [o] in the word `@` dovlet".
We u'se thi*s wo{rd believing that it comes from th^e word for pressure ('davlenie').
But `}` pressure" and `\` loom over" are etymologically not only not close an}d a*re eve]n in some sense opposed in meaning.
Hav#e a think about that fo;r yourself.
'Dovlet' (t?o loom o$ver) (liturgical, liter}ary, obsolete) means `^` quite, complete, enough, to b$e sufficient for someone or something, t-o sat>i>s>fy".
I`t is related t<o t^he words 'dovolstvovatsya' (to be c~on~tent) and 'udovolstvie' (pleasure).
P/revio/u/sly, it a`lso had the m|ean|in|g of `#` not to depend on anything, t>o be self-contained" - "to pr(ev(ai(l over oneself".
The Old Slavonic "д%овьлѣ%ти '[' ('|dovl|et|i') is akin t`o the words "command" and "will '}'.
"Dav;it" (t%o crush), `+` podavlyat '\' (to suppress) are completely different.
Th%ese words hav@e genuinely creepy "rel^at^i^ve^s '@': daos - "wolf" (crushing sheep), de~y~ja - "to die" a=nd dvaidī - "to oppress '"'.
The similar pho#net#i#c appearance of the words `/` davl_e_nie" (`)` pressure") and `|` davlet '*' ("to loom over"), as well as the inevitable obsolescence of the latter, force:d them to contami=na=te on[e another.
So we had this ve=ry "d [a] vl.et ’", which i}s also used in writing w"ith an `)` a '<', which, really, is incorrect and impos=sible fr_om the point o_f view of th)e pr^ocesses of the origin and development of these words.
So, it's correct to wr^ite "d@ovlet" ("to l#oom ove:r").
But thi$s word is ob(s(o(le(te and in its corre;ct meaning it is n^o longer used.
If yo~u want to note that any circumstances/people exer/t a negative impact on y(ou from above, use the word "davit '@' (`%` t&o oppress").
You can also use t(he construction "exert pressure", but remember tha"t t]h]is soun"ds bureaucratic.

"Kimi, today did yo`u have the chance t$o fig@ht for the pole?
How did the c:ar pe@r@form?
"It looks like Mercede*s w$ere m'u'ch faster t_o_day", said Raikkonen, as reported by F1News.Ru.
But the performance o[f our car was the best since the beginning o_f t}h}e we(ekend".
`|` Du[ring qualifying you were no slower than Sebastian Vettel, but i%n the end the gap was stil#l quite l)a)rge.
What was th)e re!ason for that?"
"I wasn't doing badly, but then one of th/e M!erce!des drivers g"ot a#h#ead.
He was prepari"n"g to overtake and m!ange!d to get rou$nd me, and this evidently lo/st me some time.
However, it is u/nli/kely this greatly a*ffe*ct the result ';'
`\` I`t i`s very d]iff]icu]lt to overtake in Sochi . Will the start of the race b(e the key moment?"
Basically y`ou never know how things will tur^n out.
In any cas'e i?t won't be easy, because our car i}s not=iceab=ly slower than Mercedes".

Russia protected i~tself from terr&orists with its operation in Syria
After three years of Russian military operations in Syri/a, approximately 100,000 terrorist%s have been killed, of whi?c?h 8{5,000 were killed b\y t?he Russian Aerospace Forces.
This wa@s discussed in connection with the third anniversary of the sta*rt of the Rus;s;ia;n military operation i@n Syria by the former co$m$ma$nde$r in chief o{f the Aerospace For.ces, the head of the Fe]derati]on Council Committee on Defen~ce and Security Viktor Bondarev.
He noted the high accur=ac=y of airborne weaponry: Aerospace Forces hav[e precisely struck a(nd co'ntinue to precisely strike al'l their terrorist targets.
In Bondarev's words, after t\h\ree years i~n Sy}ria te~ns o%f thousands of terro'rist targets have been destroyed - including, for example, ammunition stockpiles, fortifications, an;d headquarters.
R/ussian airstrikes broke the jihadists' defences - this was a de&cisiv&e investment in the advance of Syrian g;o;vernment for(c(e(s, repor`ts Interfax.
In th>is regard, i>n t,h,e words of Bondarev, the ope)rati)o)n of ou[r forces in Syria allowed the protection of Russia itse,lf from te)r)rorists, many of whom had Russian passports.
At the start of th+e operation in Syria o'v'er two thirds o<f the territory of the Arab Rep<u<bl<ic was under the control o-f terrorist groups, including the `>` Islamic S,ta,te" (IS, prohibited in Ru'ssia) a_nd "Jab%ha%t al-Nusra" (prohibited in Russia).
Acco(rdin(g to the data of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Force(s, four th%ousand IS fighters are Ru{ssian citizens an&d around five thousand are c(itizens of pos_t_-Soviet countries, reports TASS.
This figure refers o%nly t{o th,ose people wh:o have been identified, and does not taken int/o account those who were not identified, Bondarev emp`has`ize`d.
Th=e majority of t.he.m were trai>ned a#nd prepared to take up arms a>t any moment, and Russian passports gave them the rig,ht to freely enter the territory o}f our country.
Thu~s, remarked Bondarev, in Syria Russia fights international terrorism abroad - otherwise this evil would `,` s}pill over onto u"s . '?'

These murders according to international law a\r\e w<a<r c_rim_es," he said.
I<n Muallem '!s words, U'S'A and their partners showed `=` direct s=upport for terrorists", since the goals of fighters and the we:s:tern coalition in Syria coincided and presupposed `{` sowing chaos, death an#d destruction along its pa`t`h".

Metropolitan Hilario:n compared th#e decision of Kiev to rename th'e UOC with actions of fasists
The head of the s{yno{di{al Department o(f External Church Relations of th{e Russian Orthodox Church Metropolitan Hilari.o.n com(p(ared the r;en;aming o~f the Ukrainian Orthodox Church of th[e Moscow Patriarchate t~o the Russian Church in Ukraine with the actions of fascists in relation to Jews.
`}` I"t is th+e equivalent of how in fascist Germany t.he.y pinned a yell'o'w star on Jews, it me`a`ns marki~ng th+e Church as an enemy organization, an]d precisely for that purpose this draft le"g"is"lati"on was created," said the metropolitan in a broadcast of the tel;evision channel Rossiya-24 (qu+ote from Interfax).
I.n hi's o_pinio_n, this step will have t"he most serious consequences rig:ht now, when the Russo-Ukrainian conflict is at an acute stage.
Kiev in t:his way hopes to receive full control o]ve]r the UO\C and `$` outlaw it", considers the clerg'y'man.
`(` I*t is a Ukrainian ch:urch, and the believers o-f this church consider t`h`e`mselves Ukrainian, they ar?e patriots of their country," he added.
Earlier it be(c(ame k%nown that deputies of the Verkhovna Rada a/re working on implementing draft bill N#o . 4#128 (on changing the go<ve<rn<ance of religious organizations), No . 4511 (on the speci&a&l stat/us of religious organizat;ions,) and No . 5309 (o`n renaming religious organiza%t%i%ons).

Vic'a'r of Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra calls for protec}tion of Orthodoxy and Ukrainian sh{r{i{nes
The Vicar of the Holy Dormit[i[on Pochayiv Lavra M#etr#op#olitan Vladimir called for the protection o_f the Orthodox faith and Uk,rain,ian hol%y places.
The text of his appeal to followers of the Ukrain?ian Or|t|h|odox Church (UOC) was pu)bl)i)sh)ed on Saturday on the monastery '<s we=bsite.
As t\he metropolitan noted, "Christians have been called up'on to confess th~e~ir f[aith a=nd protect thei[r shrines at different times in the history of our predecessors a}nd spiritual brethren.
In light of th@e situation that has developed, and based o[n the information t$hat we have obtained as well as the th\rea\ts of re;pri;sals that are spreading, it i/s cl^e^ar that w<e are bei:ng called on to live through a period of adversity as wel,l . ”
He called for p.rayers and other form]s o#f moral support.
In addition, the vi_ca_r of the Lavra emphasized t;hat "your physi!cal presence will al"so likely be required . '*'
The priest added: "Lenin's spiritual grandchildren a=re threatening reprisals, an)d therefore w{e need t#o defe!nd our shrines."
The message states: "As peop%le who care about the fate of t^he Pochayiv La'vra, an Orthodox Ukra=i=nian shrine and holy p-lac-e of world#wi#d#e significance, we must be ready to defe;n;d it . '}'
T"he Metro#politan urg+ed his followers not to b}e taken in by those who mislead believers.
The vicar continued, `?` T;he UOC has canonical status, a"s w*as d'etermined by the Tomos of October 29, 1990, that was iss)ued by the M_ot_her Church.
And n!o!w someo/ne wants to make us dependent on th?e newly s,tyled Patriarch Bartholomew, who is a friend of the R(oman Catholic pope.
This new style with the consequences tha"t i-t entai<ls is unacceptable to us Orthodox.
We a(re pleased with the st]a]tus that our church alrea%dy has."
H&e recalled th&at since October 1990, the UOC has be+en canonically independent a<s well as completely administratively independent:
"It is in n*o way administratively or f[ina[ncially a/ccou/ntable to the Moscow Patriarchate.
I?n fact, our church alread,y has a tomos.
What further Tomos do w.e ne+ed?" T^h^e metro{pol{i{t{a{n of the Holy Dormition Pochayiv Lavra Vladimir urged believers and all cit{i{zens of the country to ask the!mselves: if ot"her confessions have a Tomos, does t_hat make them independent of t!he Vatican?
The priest emphasized, "Believers have alread%y under!stoo!d a:nd decided whic/h church they will attend.
Ho#wever, someone wants to sow hostili`ty and discord once a`gai`n.
Some are stung with envy of the churches a!nd their shining dome`s, and they w#ant to destroy th?em . '/'

The main Mac+e+doni+an opposition leader refused to vote on t%he re?f?erendum
On Sunday, S"e"p"tember 30th, in Macedonia, a referendum will take place on the question o;f an inter-governmental agreement with Greece o?n r&enaming the Repu.bl.ic o#f Macedonia.
Citizens must a=n=swer one question: "D>o you support membe{rship in th.e E,U and NATO, making an agreement between the R=e=pu=blic of Macedonia and the Republi!c of Greece?"
Nevertheless, the leader of the main opposition pa#rty "Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization - D\e\m\ocratic Party fo<r Macedonian Nati$onal Unity" (IMR@O - D~PMNU) Christian Mitskosky a{nnounced that he would not vote on th)e referendum.
As announced b^y the party press secretary Naum Sto}i}lkovsky, Mitskosky decided to abstain from voting i$n order to express their disagreement w~ith the agre|emen|t, which he considers `[` detrimental . '`'
According t,o t^he press secretary, the current referendum decides the issue of re.naming the cou`ntry and nothing more, since the strategic goal of t|h|e part&y is to achieve NATO and E<U membership.
A week ago, the P{resid{ent o'f Macedonia George Ivanov r.efused to participate in t/he referendum.
He clarified that he chose the name for t~he country 27 years ago in a referendum on independence . The Maced?onian l"ea"d"er lo!oks negatively on t_he idea of ren|aming the c=ou=ntry.
`~` I`t creates a ne~w se#mi-sover#e#i#g#n government with a new name," remarked Ivanov.
T^he agreement o#n t"he new official name of the former Yugoslavian Republ!ic - the Republic of Nor~thern Macedonia - was signed by the heads of the Mi>nis>tri>es of Foreign Affairs o{f Macedonia and Greece on June 17th o}f th(is year du<ring a ceremony on t.he shore o'f Lake Prespa, through which runs the border between the two countries.
This agreement should decide a disagreement that h?as lasted for m&any years over the name of the country, and also mark a step to?wards NAT~O a{nd EU mem$be$rs$hip, reports T(A(SS.

I/n e*ssen*ce, in the territory o"f Afghanistan fighters wage>d a real territorial war against the government authorities and peaceful population of t+he country.
`>` This year set a record f[o[r the number of bloody ter]rori]st attacks, as a result o.f which thousands of innocen`t Afghans have died," remarked Pa)trush)ev.
Afghanistan's tr)ou)bles began long a~go.
After t%he terrorist attacks o:f September 11, t-he te]rrori]st group "Al Qaeda" (prohibited in the Russian Federation), entrenched in Afghanistan, was declar,ed t^o be th-e USA's ch+ief enemy.
Not a month passed before America and i\ts NATO a-llies began O:pe:ra:t:ion Enduring Freedom th}e}re.
Seventeen years have pa/ssed.
Several thousand American troops a/re currently in Afgh[an[istan territory.
Nevertheless, peaceful life is eve#n more illuso%ry n+o+w than before.
American fo,r,ces have been dri>ven behind the fences of dozens of their b!ases.
Despite t|h|e|ir efforts, militants are pai\d off merely not to touch th+em.
The Government of Afghanistan controls a minority of t*he country's territory - 4*0%, a&c&cordi&ng to Patrus'hev.
50% is controlled b)y the Taliban (prohibited in the Russ.ian Fe)d)e)r)atio)n).
Another 10% is controlled by ISIL (proh%ibited i_n the Rus,sian Federation).
But the+y a~re quickly growing.
Their goal is t(o create a barbarian pseud]ocaliphate i!n Ce<n<t<ra<l Asia - exactly the one th!at did not succeed in Iraq and Syria.
By all app(earanc(es, America is b>ehind this.
Am'er'i'ca is also behind the fac"t t@ha@t, after 1*7 y{ears of its presence in the region, the production of narcotics (opiates) i#n Afghanistan has increased by a't least a factor of 4'0.

Macedonians a+re preparing to v!ote in a referendum on joining th<e E`U and NATO, sub!jec!t to changing the name of the country.
An agreement to rename th\e former Yugoslav Republic of Mac`edon`ia as the Republic o_f Northern Macedonia was reached on J(une 17 as a result o`f long-term negotiations with neighboring Greece, whi`ch refused to recognize the right of its northern neighbor to b[e c!alled Mace,doni,a, per,ceivin,g that such a name challenged the sam(e Greek province and Gr,e,ek history.
Lyupko Petkovsky, political scientist: "Th@anks to thi+s agreement, Macedonia or Northern Macedonia is gaining th[e right to a bet't'er future an+d hope for so}cial change.
An}d Gr@ee@ce will secure its right to its past.
There are no pe"rfec"t agre'ements.
Th_ey arise as a result o(f difficult compromises and they c,a,n not make absolutely everyone h*appy".
The ruling social demo#cr#a#t#s, l;ed by the prime minister Zor,an Zaev, ar@e in favor o*f renaming the country.
The con^servat^iv^e opp[ositio[n and the country's president Gj<o<rge Ivanov are against it.
According to journalist Tsvetin Chilimanov, it does not make sense for Macedon,ia t`o join the EU - it i=s sufficient to hav<e par`t`ners`hi`p relations w?ith it: “ Many people who do n=ot like the agreement believe that the current s(o(cialis(t government headed by Za%ev has been imposed from the outside i+n order to change the n[ame o:f the c)ou)ntry.
B-ut this decision will bring about negative c$onsequences.
First of a)l)l, loss of sovereig%nty.
Clearly there a^re countries that would not want Macedonia to remain one of t<he sovereign countries i@n th_e Balkans ')'.
Fei Dulgeri, Euronews: “ The former Yugos&lav Republic of M]a]cedonia is facing the biggest c(hal(lenge i@n i<t<s history.
The country i?s a_t a crossroads.

The real effective ex`chan`ge rate (a figur*e t'hat takes into acco~unt changes i_n the exch\ange rates of the countries that a"re the main trading partners of the Russian Federation) will remain stable, offi>cial>s say.
As f!or in}fl}ati}on, by 2020 i@t will be 3.,5%, and then it will stabilize at the level o@f a.b.o.ut 4%, according to the Ministry of Finan+ce.
