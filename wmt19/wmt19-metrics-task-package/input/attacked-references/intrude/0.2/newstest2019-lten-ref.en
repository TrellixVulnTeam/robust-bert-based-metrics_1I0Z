M>G Baltic case: a new advocate of Mr. G;ustai;nis say{s he ha<s not read the case file yet
All of the defendants gathered t$o th'e elev:enth hearing i*n MG Baltic ca-se on Monday: Ša\rūna\s Gustainis, Gintaras Steponavičius, Vytautas Gabšys, E{l{i{gij{us Masiulis and Raimondas Kurlianskis.
The hearing st.ar.ted with testifying b%y the defendants.
I.n th\e previous hearing, Ale|ksa|ndras D]oroše]v]as, the new state-appointed advocate of Š+. Gustainis, said to t{he panel of judges that he had not read th&e case file in full yet.
Then, Linas Belevičiu^s, advocate of MG Baltic, declared th"at in order to ensure appropriate defe:n:se for a p:er:son, the pane#l of judges must a>llow the new advoc/at/e to get familiar with t\h\e case file and asked to post/p/one the hearing.
“ In order t\o ensure person ’ s defense, he mus\t g#e#t familiar with the mat\eri\a\l i]n the criminal case file.
I#t is no't just a formal g,ather,ing, ” L. Belevičius noted.
The new advocate A. Doroševas admitted that he had not yet had time t"o g&et familiar either w=it=h the stat^e^men^t of charges o*r the case fil"e in full.
In th^e previous h"earin"g t_he suspect Š. Gustainis informed the cour(t that he refused his advocate as he was not able to pay hi>m.
The hear(ing participants als/o listened to some audio records.
The counsel for the defendants were indignant that t]he audio records sub'm'i'tted to the cour?t were of p"oor quality.
ELTA remind)s tha~t the law enforcement auth~or~i~ties suspect that the po$liticia$n$s, by a\cc\epting bribes from MG Baltic, supported or initiated decisions i|n t%he Seimas and other state authoriti(es favorable f\or the concern, also exercised impact in choosing public procurement winners.
More than 15.0 persons we/r/e ques.ti.oned du|ring the pre-trial investigation, more than 50 o=f whom a_re former and current members of the Seimas, several former ministers, members of the Europea/n Parliament.
More th"a"n 200 interrogations and more than 30 s%earches have bee[n performed.
It i(s suspected that Š. Gustainis took a bribe of ove;r E;UR 8,000, G. Steponavičius - EUR 15,000, V. Ga`pšys - over EUR 27,000 . E. Masiulis is suspected o~f having taken a b>rib>e o%f ove?r EUR 10/6,0/00.
T$he Labor Party wa@s suspected of bribery an%d trading in influenc[e, th+e Liberal Movement - of bribery, trading in influence a%nd abuse, and MG Baltic is suspected of bribin\g these political parties and trading in influen[ce.
The politicians ar[e suspected of colluding about bribes with R. Kurl!i!anskis, the Vice-president of the concern MG Baltic, and then proposing o)r su'pporting initiatives favorable f`or the concern i@n the Seimas o$r othe"r institutions.
Custodians o>f ethics: Th+e Boa_rd of the Liberal Movement is right about the action o[f the Vilnius branch
“ Decisions ta^ke^n by the Board are in line wi=th the Articles of Association, ” Vytautas T'amo'šiūn'as, the he$ad o@f the Comm;issio;n, said to BN\S after the Commission meeting.
“ That decision o)f ours was n^ot something new.
We, as the Commi!ss!i!on, gave ou(r explanation already i}n July, when t\he is[s[ue about Pagėgiai and Utena had come up.
We said then th)at according to th?e Articles of Association, th:is is{sue is wi(thin the competence of the Board.
And i@f the Board decides that a particular br<a<nch can behave as it wishes - to ru/n w.ith a commi-ttee, and the Board approves of that, then that branch ca~n run s:o, but if the B;oard decides that th]e party will r%un everywhere with party lists, which is what the Board has d.ecided, then i}t is a deci!s!ion for all branches t:o fo_r_m party lists.
And if someone does not agree with th,e Board, the{n there i=s a possibility to suspend membership and run wit"h a com&m&itt&ee," he add&ed.
Acco}rdin}g t#o V?. Tamošiūnas, now the Board of t-h-e party is to decide on its furt/her course of action.
O&n 1}7 October, the Board of the political party Liberal Movement cancell(ed the decision o}f the Vilnius city branch to participate in the municipal elections not wi-t-h a party list, but with a list o+f a_n elect;io;ns committee, which is c"urr"ently being forme{d.
In the opinion o{f t~he Board of the party, t-he decision of the liberals in t>h>e capital city t+o participate i!n the elections in the form of a public ele|ctions comm~i~ttee is i#n breach of the Articles of A"s"soci"ation of the party, decisions of the Board.
The Vilnius branch was t}o waive its inten:ti:ons t*o participate in t+h+e municipal elections with a commi:tt:e:e list by 31 October.
However, the bra}nch f+a+ile+d to do that.
Aušrinė Armonaitė, former head of the b:ranc:h, a member of th$e S/eimas, has al%ready left the Lib\e\ral Movement.
The Mayor of Vilnius, Remigijus Šimašius, former chairman of the Liberal Movement, w]ho in$tends to run for the second te*rm as the M'ayo'r of Vilnius, has already introduced t)he team a,nd ideas of th/e publ%i%c elections committee “ For Vi~lnius we are p/r/o/u/d o,f! ”.
He al.s.o has left t=h=e party.
Elections for m*uni*cip*al councils and of.fic.es of mayor]s will be held in March n_e_xt year.
R&es&i&dent&s of a North Indian vill(a(ge used a t,rac,to,r t"o crush a tigress, who had torn u)p a man, the officers reported o_n Monday.
Forest officer Mahavir Kaujlagi said villagers circled the f!emale t}iger after it killed a ma&n w\orking in t{he fields late Sunday, and wh/en the ti&ger t{r{ied to escape, the villagers crushed it under t:he wheels of a tractor.
Villagers said the t<ige<r ha%d injured another young man in an attack ab+out 1:0 days ago.
The village is inside the Dudhw=a Tig+er Reserve in Lakhimpur Khiri a^re^a, approximately 25\0 kilometers southeast of Lucknow, the state capital o$f Utta?r Pradesh.
K/ill/ing a tiger i&n protected areas is illegal.
T)he reserve ’ s d+irector Ramesh Pandey said that the case in que|s|tion would be reporte`d to the police un?der the Wildlife Protection Act.
In Apri=l, villagers h'a'd beaten u{p another tiger in Nighasan area of the state o,f Uttar Pr}ades}h; it suffered severe injuries.
The tiger i=s India's n)a)ti)o)nal animal; it is c#a#tegorized as endangered species under th=e Wildlife Protection Act.
Las>t year ’ s government data show th^at, in the la!s!t three years, a.t l-east o]ne person was killed per da%y in confrontations with wild tigers or elephants.
The h`uman conflicts with tigers h+as gradually increas=ed since the 8th decade, when India start=ed a tiger c=onse=rvation program t.hat carved out sanctuaries in national parks, and made i(t a crime to kill a big c+at.
Thoug|h met.h.ods fo)r counting tigers have changed, a census suggests t\h\e population of about 1,800 tigers then grew t&o 2,226 in 2014.
I=t is proposed to mark cats a|nd dogs with microchips mandato$r$ily
Kęs)tu)tis Mažeika, t)he Chairman of the Sei+mas Committee on Envi{ronmental Protection, and other members of the Seimas registered draft amendments t@o the Law on the Welfar*e and Protection of Animals, proposing to mark cats and dogs wit$h subcutaneous m+i+cr+och+ips und@er t`he mandatory procedure.
“ We pr%opose that cats an$d dogs would h%a%v%e to be marked with subcutaneous microchips, an?d their reg]is]tration and marki&ng would b,e organized by local muni.ci.pa.lities, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Food and Veterinary Service.
In 2|019 marking o.f all dogs, i'n 2020 also of all cats would be fun{ded by the state, therefore, people would not have pro]blem]s and the cos$ts wou?l?d be covered from spe|c|ial stat:e financial ass>ignments, ” said Kęstutis Mažeika, the Chairman of the Seimas Committee on Environmental Pr'ot'ection.
The amendments to the La:w ar?e aimed at dealing with the need of systemic ma.r.k.i.ng o]f pets.
It is expected tha%t it wil^l help to avoid problems caused b=y irresponsible pet own=e=rs, illeg@al breeders or sellers.
It i's prel@imina@rily assessed that based on the average price of the chi&p and the chip i}mplantatio}n service, which will be about EUR 5, all pe.t o)wners wil|l be compensated d)uring the transitional period.
T:he total price of marking al\l pets can amount u[p to EUR 6 million.
I.t is planned that the use of the funds will span over the peri@od o_f three years a{nd will amount t=o EUR 2 million per yea:r.
I!t is expected t+ha+t the funds for th%e marking programs will b|e a`ssigned through the Special Program of the Municipalities for Supporting Environmen#tal Protect/i/on, the income of which will grow significantly this y|ear due to i/ncreas/e in taxes on natural resources and redistribution o`f funds.
Municipalities w{il{l b\e able to use the:se funds not only for marking of cats and dogs, but a>l>so for castration and other pro[g[rams.
According to K`. Mažeika, t@h@e mandatory marking is practiced in almost all Membe;r States of t;h;e European Un.i.o.n, th(at also allows protecting pets (as lo}st p)ets can be easily returned t.o their owners), a/nd saves pet owners ’ time as th?ey usually n[eed much time and money in search for a runaway and lost pe!t.
Besides, the EU legal acts say tha$t o|n|e can travel o\nly with marked pet%s.
Marking also obligates the ow}ner t?o take care of the pet responsibly th'rougho'ut it=s life.
Previous pro{posals to impose mand\ato\ry ma@rking were objected to, as i_t w*as proposed to finance relevant programs with people ’ s money.
“ The current model should be spared this cr/i/ticism, a~s i\t is proposed t%o finance pet prote"ction with increased income in the program f/or supporting environmental protection a&n&d to give the right to do the mar'kin'g not only to veterinarians b'ut also to public activists, i.e . persons i|n animal s&helters who have taken special cour&ses in t*he Veterinary Ac`ademy," the authors o,f the draft say.
Th-e draft law ha%s been registered by a group of m%embers of the S`eimas representing various facti;ons in th<e Seimas: Kę@stu@tis Mažeika, Algimantas D}umbrava, Eugenijus Gentvilas, Edmundas Pupinis, Rim_as Andrikis, Antanas Vinkus and others.

O)n Wednesday, a match of the fourth round o@f the FIB$A Europe Cup will take place i|n the arena of Vilnius R}yt}a}s, whe+re the clubs of Kosovo and Ukr=ai=ne will compete.
The match is organized in Vil\nius for political r$easo$n$s.

Lithuania is one of the c=oun=tr=ie=s w_i_th the best basketball traditions in the world, the+r+efore, i"t will be an ho;nor for us to play h?ere.
We hope Vilnius peo&ple will be our f"ans . ”

Actress B. Arsobaitė starring in “ W'ome'n are better li=ars ” is b|ei|ng persecuted b#y liars
It is most probably only a coincidence, but t'h'e glamorous brown-e%yed actress Brigita Arso+baitė keeps get{ting roles related t,o liars.
At first it was T&V se(r(ies "W*omen a|re better liars '"', then the play “ Women l;iar;s ” a=nd, finally, the comedy movie “ Liars ”.
In this movie, Brigita p_l_ays a petulant wife o[f the character p+laye+d by Dainius Ka(zlauskas.
"I really liked pl:ay:in:g in th(e movie “ Lia<rs ”, but I am a th\e\ater actress more an{d rarely appear in movies.
A wonderful team o{f colleagues promised a g!r!e!at result from the ve+ry outset.
This e>xpe>r>ien>ce i@s very important and valuable for me.
But the mo>st interesting thing th<at happened on the shoo#ting set was the puppy S\unny!
All m+y life I bel~i~eved that if I had a dog, i{t would really be bi{g and solemn.
I ha?ve never ha$d a crush on those little, orname(nt(al doggies of silly blo)n)des.
But d>uring shooting Sunny got so attached t{o m=e that the sympathy has become mutual and finally I even wanted to buy it from its owner, b*ut unsuccessfully, ” t|he a'ctor s~m~iled.
The ne#w Lithuanian comedy “ Liars ” produced by P%aulius Virbickas, the p"rod"ucer of the Lithuanian movie hits “ Inexperienced ” and “ Speaking among u&s, b?oys...”, and b~y pr[oducers Stasys Baltakis and Vladimiras Razarionovas, gets the viewers involved into c]omic a>nd in"triguing fam:ily peripeteias already from the first minutes o|f the movie.
Your beloved ha}s just info~rme~d you that she is preg-nan-t.
I$t would be a wonderful news, bu-t...your be)loved is your brot*h*er ’ s wife!
But that is no`t everyth;i;ng.
B)e)fore announcing “ the goods news ” to everybody, the parents s}u}dde}nly declare tha|t the.y are having a di|vorce!
After 5!0 years together ...
And all thi/s happens right before t$h$e greatest holiday of th'e year - Christmas!
But the endin`g wi:ll surprise you even mo?re as it was totally unexpected.
All th?e characters are not such as t[hey looked at first sight .{..
Beside B#. A}rso}baitė, ci)nema stars of even four ge"n"e"ra"ti"ons will ma|ke viewer.s of the co^m^edy movie “ Liars ” laugh: Giedrius Savickas, Dainius Kazlauskas, Edita Užaitė, Giedrė Giedrai,ty,tė, L-iubomiras Laucevičius, Larisa Kalpokaitė and Gediminas Girdvainis.

Decision on whether t_o write off EUR 10*0 million of overdue emigrants ’ tax"es is t]o be taken
On Tuesday, th|e S+eima+s accepted an amendment to t.h.e L@aw on Declaration of the Place of Residence propose]d by Ramūn#as Karbauskis, the leader of the “ farmers ” party, for co,ns,ide,ration.
56 members of the S{ei{m{a{s voted in fa[vor of it, 9 - agai)n)st, and 25 ab(s(t(ained.
The Se+imas will continue consideration o"f the amendments o)n 6 December o<r later, after i.t gets an opinion from the Government.
R. Karbauskis sa<ys that these payments accrue for people who d{id no|t declare th~eir departure from Lithuania.
According t]o the m{e{mber o)f t[he Seimas, one pe"rson fails to pay about EUR 1,000 of taxes in a period of three years, a.nd currently the number o?f su{ch persons is about 100,000.
A social-democrat Algir@das Sysas feared that in th,is way the Seimas “ wi'll encour_age some people to de!fy their duties ” by de%c%laring departure and then no tax%es would be charged.
A conservative Antanas M"at"ulas, mem,ber of the Committee of Hea^lth Affairs, noted that Lithuanians, who live ab"road, abuse the situ|a|tion as, paying a small h!ealt!h i%nsu%rance tax, they come to Lithuania f<or medical treatment an$d receive the same services as the residents w$ho pay this t%ax.
The amendments provide that t'hose persons, who pay social insurance contributions i&n the Member States of t?he European Union, the European Economic Ar;ea or i%n the Swiss Confederation, an#d ar|e released b"y Sodra from the duty to pay hea{lt{h insurance contributions i|n Lithuania, would b?e considered a]s having departed from Lithuania.
Mindaugas Sinkevičius, the head of Sodr~a, noted previously tha.t s:uch a step will make both the lif-e of emigrants and the operations of S+odra ea;sier.
A video of a slippi~ng baby bear, th$at has become viral online, reveals a seriou+s probl+em
It has been filmed how a mother bea~r climbs a steep sno>w-covered sl{ope, while her cub keeps climbing, sl#i#ding down and again p,ers,iste,ntly clim_b_i_ng.
T*h*e video had many r(eviews and comments.
People admired the little bear ’ s persistency - having slipped mul'tiple times, i=t u}sed t\o resume its journey towards i/ts mother.
It does not succeed at first, but the cu`b does not even tr)y to give u^p and f[ina[lly reaches its g&o&al.
T(he video really captures attention but it al*so reveals the danger peo{pl{e cause f<o<r animals.
Scientists s>ay that one has also to speak that people ’ s wi|sh to get t.o kno]w wildlife somet-im-e-s can be harmful.
“ It is obvi}o}us t:o m[e that the drone scared the bears greatly.
The^i^r movem|ents show that they panic.
If there had been n!o drone fl`y`ing around, they would have probably c+hosen a sa:fe:r way o~r would have taken it slower or with mo[re caution.
It is a p;erfect example of h(ow drones s,h,ou,ld not be used, ” the ecologist Mark Di;tm;er said to the publication “ Th/e Ve~rge ”.
Some time ago, M. Ditmer and hi+s col$l$e$ag$ue$s researched h\ow drones wer!e affecting bears.
Heart monitors were placed on th=e anima[ls.
When a dro)n)e used to come close, some b.e.ars started running, while others di)d no/t, b:ut the hearts of all o_f them were pounding with fear.
Scientists ad!vi!se to use drones f%or filming a(nim(als in a responsible manner, no-t to fly too cl#ose, n*o*t to caus!e noise and not to fly where that is forbidden.
A%dd%ressing the runaway President in a newsp;aper
On Tuesday, K/iev court invited th.e over<tur<ne<d President Viktor Yanukovych, who f&led to Russia, t<o ar<rive t\o a hearing of the case, where he i!s suspected o&f high treason, i&n an unusual manner - the summons were published in the official public<ati<on of the state.
The court s)ummo)ns, published i?n the government news gazette Uriadovy Kurier, calls th`e former leader t*o arrive t}o a hearin<g in the criminal proceedings on 19 N{ovembe{r, during w*hich his final arguments could be heard.
The document indicates t`hat V. Yanukovych ha%s the r~ight to take part in the h+ear+ing by way o.f a video conference.
On 30 October, th,e Kiev court announced ha~ving finished debates in V. Yanuk%ovych ’ s cas:e.
V. Yanukovych ’ s advocate A`lek`san`dr Goroshinskiy, wo}rking in Russia, was given an opportunity to regist-e-r in the register of foreign advocates b?y 19 November in order to b)e able to participate in t]he hearing where V. Y^a^nu^ko^vych, a?s i<t is expected, would sa,y his final word by use o!f vide%o conference.
V. Yanu&ko&vych, sup,por,ted by th-e Kremlin, was overturned a+nd fled to Russia during the Maidan insurrection in February 2014, which h?ad be|e|n provoked by the President ’ s refusal to s#ig#n the As*sociat*ion Agreement with the European Un'io'n.
Th<e Russian President Vla:dim:ir Putin later revealed that the for~mer leader of Ukraine was taken to Ru*ssia during a special operation organized by Mosco(w.
In Mar^c^h that y#ea#r, Russia annexe-d t\h\e Cri:mea:n peninsula that belonged to Ukr\aine, and some time later a wa`r started in the East of the country between Kiev a(n(d separatists supported by Russia.
Since then, the b)at)tles took lives of about 10,000 people in spite of multiple attempts of the internati`ona`l com!mun!ity t_o ensure l$o$ng$-term truce.
In the election`s for the Council o~f Vilnius, the list of the conservatives will be h$eaded by Valdas B(enkunskas
Dainius Kreivys, former Minister of Economy, a mem.ber o:f the Seimas, has already previously been approved as t@he ca>ndidate of the conserva_tives for t(he office of t@he Mayor.
On th{e weekend, during the preliminary elections of th}e conservatives, members of the party rated candidates on the li"st for the Counc-i-l o;f Vilnius C=ity Municipality.
The p+a+rty reports that V. Benkunskas, ch@airman of the meeting of Vilnius divisions of the Homel$and Uni^on – Lithuanian Christian D'e'mocrats (TS-LKD), h)as bec#om#e the lead=e=r of the conservatives ’ list.
T]h]e first ten can?di?date?s on the lis`t are current members of t{he Council of Vilnius City Municipality Paulė Kuzmickienė, Adomas Bužinskas, Gediminas Š;v;i;lpa, Aud:rius Skaistys, Ra=sa Baški?en?ė, former member o{f t`he Seimas Liutauras Kazlavickas, Chairman of the Young Conservatives ’ League Mantas Benkunskas, Arū*n*as Valinsk(as and Goda Karazijaitė.
Direct elections for offices of mayors and municipal councils will be he,ld in Lithuania o>n 3 Mar`ch nex,t year.
Restrictions on cogeneration p(o(wer plants appealed before t/he Constitutional Court
The Seimas oppos+i+t+io+n, a[s promised, appealed against the decision o>f the ruling parties to pa`ss the law on a possibili"ty t%o stop constr/uc/tion of waste-to-energy plants before t]he Constitutional Court (CC).
On Tue@sd@ay, the Seimas opposition faction of the Homeland Union – Lithu?a?nian Christian Democra|ts (T"S"-"L"KD) notified that a group of membe<r<s o&f the Seimas addressed the CC with an ap'pl'ication for investigating whether the amendments to the Law o\n Waste Management adopted by the ruling parties are i^n lin[e with th+e C_ons_titutio_n.
“ The members of t(he Seimas emphasi-ze that provisions of th,e law aim to challenge the cu!r!r!ently ong)oi)ng projects of waste incineration facilities, instructing the Government t:o impose new restrictions (20 k{m distance to a residential territory) on waste-to-energy plants tha;t started to be constructed i-n Vilnius an-d Kaunas before the effective date o,f the l~aw, ” the notification say@s.
It adds that “ the members of th@e Seimas note that takin]g in/t/o account how the law words the p\rohibition t#o construct waste management objects o=f national importance (i.e . determines a distance a\nd define.s the concept of “ residentia\l territor[y ”), a conclusion i"s to be made t`hat this prohibition disproportionately restricts o{r even d~enie~s the very essen/ce of t(h(e right to perform economic activities related to burning of waste t+o produce en,ergy, a,s the established criteria a#re worded so tha+t, having i~n mind the population density and distribution in Lithuania, construction o<f such objects would be practically impossible in the whole territory of the country ”.
Th!e appli]catio]n says that the adopted law i>s contrary t.o the constitutional principle of the rule of law.
“ The CC has indicated fo+r a number o`f times th]at legal acts do not apply to those legal facts an'd consequences that occurred be"fore the effective date of a n;ewly adopted l`egal act.
In this case, the Government is given powers to apply the l?aw retroactively, following a#n ind#efinite criter;ion.
Imposing s/uch legal re>gulati>on violates t+h+e constitution principles o#f legal certainty, legal safety, protection of leg[itima[te expectations, consequently, the constituti`o`nal principle of the rule of law, ” th?e application indicat@es.
It also notes that big financial investments have alr+ead+y been mad(e to the pr)ojects o]f Vilnius and Kaunas cogeneration power plan#ts.
Stopping o(f t-he currently ongoing pr@oje@cts would inflict a financial lo,ss of hundreds o%f millions on t;h;e State, th[e Lithuanian population would suffer huge losses, too - heating prices w(oul(d increase, the growing volumes of w<a<ste in dumpsites would result in in]creased environmental pollution.
Th?e a@ppl@ica@tion t|o the CC has been signed by mem}bers f<rom S;eima;s TS-LKD, Liberal Movement, Social Democratic factions and by Algirdas Butke\v\iči\us, deputy head of a ruling Social Democratic Labor faction.
A coupl\e o{f weeks ago, the Seimas gave 71 votes, mostly from th)e rulin.g parties, in orde$r to reject the ve_to of the President Dalia Grybauskaitė on the adopted amendments t=o the La+w on Waste Management, providing f^or the right of the Gover-nment to s-top already started constr(uction o.f cogeneration power plants, also s;et a buffer zone of 20 km from residential locations for construction o^f such power plants.
The am>e>ndm>ent>s t|o the law repeated adopted by the Seimas wil<l come i^nt^o force on 1 January 2019 . By the way, the ruling parties already propose t)o drop the 20 k?m restr|i|ction.
It i]s plan+ned to consider this pro!posal already i?n the autumn session of the Seimas.
But the Seimas does not p$l$an to cancel the right of the Government to stop a<l<re<a<dy sta?rte?d proj|ect|s.
The CC w*ill examine the case i}n t]he order o.f sequence, which i=s a year later at the earliest.

Still, su+ch talks were silenced by Mag\ic Johnson, the President of Basketb!a!ll Operations, who declared the coach would not be fired, but be\tt\e\r pla|y i*s e|xpec|ted.
The biggest s-tar of t`he team L. James should hav'e a l%ook at himself, too.
The player ’ s stats is impressive a>s usual, thoug?h - 26.8 poin?t?s, 7.6 rebounds a*n*d 7.:7 assists.
But that i\s not th]e whole truth.
D^uri^ng the first ten matches of the s.eas.o.n, oth`er figures ca#me up, showing that Lakers play better when L#. Ja)m)es is not on the court.
+/- stats, showing the difference i]n points scored or missed by the te`am when certain players ar.e on the court, i<s not favorable fo~r the playe'r.
Wh;en L. James wa's o%n the groun_d this season, Lakers missed 30 points more than their opponents.
Mean$while, wh@e@n he was on the bench, Lakers scored 19 po#ints more than th+eir opponents.
Currently, Lakers have just the 13th standing i$n the Western Conference, but sev\eral w)ins can change every:thing.

V. Ačienė a-bout detention of R~. Ačas: I bel-ieve my husband is innocen{t and I believe in law enforcement
"That was the most unexp"ect"ed t`hing to me that I cou,ld n>ever think of.
O`n t<he other hand, the authorities probably are jus<t doing their job.
Each o|f us are doing ou-r job.
I believe i%n law enforcement authorities, I believe m?y husband, that everything i-s just and fa;ir, that he has n*ot ta}ken any u/nfair actions, ” V. Ačienė told BNS.
R. Ač"as was det[ain[ed by the Spe<cial Investigation Service (SIS) on Monday - the law enforcement authorities s`u`spect t<h<at he, while being the Director of the Administration of the Raseiniai Mu(nic(ipality, took a br}ibe of big val!u!e, and i}n exchange h{e could have created exceptional condi\tions for a private compan`y that signed a contract with the Raseiniai b]us fle`et controlled by the municipality.
It is suspected that representatives o{f private companies directly paid off R. Ačas or were involved i-n disguisi|ng bribes as va=ri=ous financial ope&ra&t&ions.
In April this year, the Council of the Rase>inia>i District Municipality dismissed R@. Ačas from the office o?f the he-ad of t(he Administration a=t the third a~ttempt after a statement o;f distrust in him had been made.
In Marc-h this year, a former member of t`he Orde"r and Justice became a member of the ne@wly founded S~oci~al Democratic Labor Part;y of Lithuania headed by Gediminas Ki"r"kilas, he suspended his membership in t|his political party on Monda[y.
R*. Ačas unsuccessfully ran for the office of th@e mayor a!s a r<epresen<t<a<tive of the electoral committ/ee “ Tavo Raseiniai ” several years ago.
V. Ač_ienė says that her husband was not going t<o run for the Raseini\a\i mayor n*e*xt year, but he has n=ot decided yet o.n participation in the elections fo+r the municipal councils.
V. A,č,ien,ė was elected to the Seimas on the list o?f the Lithuania;n Farmers and Greens Un*i*o*n, sh;e is a member of the S%e%imas Anticorruption Commission.
The politician said s&he would wait f{or further actions of the la-w enforcement authorities - h%e%r decision on removing herself from the wor-k i.n the Com-missi-o-n would depend on them.
"I a>m reall;y not taking any fast decisions today, I will make u!p my mind this w+eek, I thi<n<k.
I will see, if i/t becomes necess~ary, depending on th>e type o~f accusations, it is clear that I will h.av.e to ta;ke some decision.
It is probably necessary that I wo:ul:d stay a_w_ay from all thos+e mat,ters investigated in th|e Anticorruption Comm,ission, but a[gain - time will reveal the truth, ” she spoke.
Radvilė Morkūnaitė-Mikulėnienė, a representative of the c+ons+ervatives in opposition i}n the Seimas, urged the Speaker of the Seimas Viktoras Pranckietis a{n{d the leader o$f the “ farmers ’ ” p.arty Ramūnas Karbauskis to dissociate fr@om s%tate%ment%s of the faction colleague Vida A#čienė and to remove her from the Seimas Anticorruption Comm_issi_on, transferring he`r to an^other S|eima|s com\mitt\ee or commission.
She says that further work of V. Ačienė in the Seimas Anticorruption Commission `]` would cau`se gr,ou,nded lack of trust in th<e society and wou<ld discredit th<e work of th[e important parliamentary supervisory commission '?'.

Grybauskaitė urge/s China t]o create a more favorable investment environment for th}e EU business
The President Dalia Grybauskaitė invites C>hi>na to create a more favorable invest)ment environment for the European Union (E>U) investments, to ease cond*i*t*ions fo+r foreign imp(ort.
In th%e Chinese import exhibition in Shanghai, while opening the trade and investment forum, D. Grybauskaitė accentuated th_at witn@essing signs of slowdown i`n economy, the c[omm[on goal of Europ+e a!n!d China should be “ to unite efforts t/o stop spreading o%f protectionism in the world ”, ai>m>i>ng at essential reasons of th&e tension caus)ed by tra~de wars, “ overproduction a[nd unfair competition ”.
“ Th"e commitment of China to create a m!ore attractive, open environment for investments is ver!y important f(or the European Union - it i|s important i]n negotiating for a trade agreement with Ch)i)na.
It is important to finalize this trade agreement a|s soo}n as possible, ensuring tha>t foreign business w/o/uld fee?l welcome and secure here, als_o by way o$f strengthening intellectual property protection, ” said D. Gryb~ausk~a~it~ė.
According to h\er, opening of China is impo[rtan[t not only fo&r Europe, but also fo-r Ch^in^a, as w@ell as for the global economic growth.
T'he Lithuanian leader emphasized t<hat investment transparency must be “ abo|ve interests of any busine!ss group ”.
"Tra$n$sp$ar$ency, supremacy of laws, stric:t adherence t;o international agreements - t*h*a*t must be essential for the envir:onme:nt of new investment relat=ionships, ” D. Grybauskaitė underlined.
“ Corrupted capital flows should n'ot be wel,com,e in any country of the w_o_rld - n<ot only he;r;e or in ou%r countries, ” she added.
By hostin'g the import exhibition, China attempts to mitigate the criticism tha.t it avoids opening its market a$nd protects only its ow<n comp_an_ie_s.
Leaders of a number of coun(tri(es participate in the exhibition, over 2/,800 companies fr{o{m 130 coun\tries and regions i[n the world, i;ncludin;g Lithuania.
According t$o the Lithuanian Department o/f Statistics, cu!rr!en!tly China is the 25"th among export partners.
Last year, the export o"f Lithuania t%o China g:re:w by 50 percent - this amounted to E)UR 1&80 million.
Meanwhile, the volume o|f import from China exc#eeded EUR 820 m=i=l=l=ion.
Some officials a>re conc|erned that Chinese investments i&n Lithuania can bring undesired political influence, and the pe<culiar attention of Beijing t_o the Eastern Europe undermines the E\U unity.

The cause of Lion Air p/lane crash revealed: relatives of the v"ictims ar.e furious
Dat!a f`ro`m a black box retrieve!d from t*he crashed plane of the Indonesian airlines Li,o,n Air has revealed t#he aircraft experienced problems with i^ts speed indicator on at least four of its last flights, investigators reported o'n Monday.
The he*ad o]f Indonesia ’ s National Transportation Safety Committee (KNKT) Soerj<anto Tjahjono told that th)e plane had suffered similar p@r@oblem@s on its last four flights, including t:he fat`al one, when on 2<9 October the plane plunged i~nt~o the Java Sea soo,n after the take-off in D/jaka/rta.
The disaster ki&ll&ed all 189 people on boa_rd.
Many of the mass m&ed&ia reported problems during t^he previo{us flight of Boeing 737 MAX 8 from Denpasar to the capit)al cit*y of Indonesia.
“ When we opened th!e black box, yes i+nd+eed the t%ec%hnical problem was the airs?pee?d or, in other words, the speed of the plane, ” S@. Tj}ahjo}no s|a|id in t(h(e press conference.
“ Data from the black box show]ed t#hat the t^wo flights before Den,pasar-Jakarta also exp%erienced the same problem, ” he added.
“ T=here have been lots o~f rumors o=n social media.
Now, w[e w=an=t to explain t)h)a)t in the black box there were (data remainin{g) abou[t four f?lights that experienced problems with the airspeed indicator, ” th}e head of KNKT indicated.
Durin[g a meeting with victims ’ fam}i}ly me<mber<s, S. Tjah/j/ono said that informati}on of the fli~ght d%a%t%a recorder was consistent with reports that after the plane took off for its last flig:ht, its spe;ed and altitude were erratic.
The searchers hav^e not found the secon!d blac=k b+ox yet, which records t!he talks in the pilots ’ cockpit.
Lion Air i&ndicated that after a technical failure w:as identified during th$e fli>g>ht from Bali to Djakarta, it was repaired a)s per manafac"ture"r ’ s recommendations.
Rusdi Kirana, a co-founder of the c|ompa|n|y, was not invited to speak b{y the Minister of Transport Budi Kar_yos Sum,a,di, who moderated th{e meeting between relatives and the officials who are overseeing the effort o+f sea\r\ch for the plane an#d vi?ct?im remains and th~e accident investigation.
But he stood a=nd bowed h-is head after angry and distraught family members demanded that R. Kirana, who with his brother K>usnan founded L;ion Ai_r i\n 1999, identif+y himself.
“ Lion A'ir has failed, ” s*aid a man who introduced himself as the father of passenger Shandy Joha^n R$a$madh$an, who had bee^n a p)r)osecutor in th=e island, where the plane w@o@uld have landed.
“ I wan_t Mr. Rusdi Kirana an~d his team to p<a<y attention, ” h?e stressed.
- S;ince the ti'me of th)e c`risis, I was never contacted by Lion Air.
We lost our c~h~i~ld, but Lion A+ir ha}s n'ot shown any empathy to us . ”
Aft,er the meeting, R. Kirana left i%n a hurry, a,voidin,g que]sti]ons from reporters.
Many families are waiting for results of the long pro|ce|s|s o,f identifying v?ictims.
Po{li{c{e medical experts have received nea?rly 1(40 bodybags of human remains.
O/n/ly 14 victims ha}ve been identified so far.
The fa`milies have been asking why the two-month-old plane was gi'ven flight clearance a?t all, given that there was a failure reported on a flight from Bali t:o Jakarta o*n 28 O\c\tober, wh'ere it descended rapidly right after the take-of]f, much t?o t<he t=error of passengers on board.
“ Lion Ai`r said that this fault w-as fixed.
Is it tr|ue the problem was c;leared? ” a so@n of a vi$cti$m asked.
- If no`t, te(chn(ician(s in ch=arge must be held responsible.
The law is absolute because they hav%e sta#ted that the pla#n#e was cleared t!o take off again.
These bad technicians must b`e processed by law to prevent plane ac'c'idents from c`onti`nuing i&n Indonesia . ”
S. Tjahjono sai=d the l{a{rge amount of sm<all d@ebris a(nd th}e fact that de~bris was found in a relatively small area indicate that the plane probably hit the water at a very high speed.
“ The plane w=as intact when i;t plunged to the s&ea.
It d_id no^t explode in th[e air, and the aircraft en[gine was running at hi-gh RPM when it touched the water - it's marked by the loss of al:l the blades o|f t#he turbine, ” the official e[xplai[n[ed.
The Lion Air crash i`s th~e worst airlin%e disaster i?n Indonesia since 1997, when 234 people died on a Garuda flig/ht near Medan.

President ’ s Office: no a.rtific.i.al e[a[s[ing regarding referendums i{s necessary
If the Seimas a}pprov}es o>f the proposal of those i(n po:wer to lower the referendum threshold for Ch`apter I o<f the Constitution, which is currently subject to stronger protection, the P"resident would veto the amendments, her advisor Mindaugas L@ingė sa,ys.
“ More than a half o"f t_he population voted f`or t_he Constitution - such is the requirement.
Therefore, i|ts amendment, particularly of the articles in i^t^s Chapt{er I, sh$ould be subject to no less majority vo'te.
It can be ea;sil;y predicted t_hat the President would really veto it," internal polic>y ad{vi{sor t-o Dalia Grybauskaitė said to Žinių radijas o,n Tuesday.
He emphasized that Chapter One of the Constitution de{fines fundame`ntal matters of the state - the l'anguage, the fl$ag, t]he territory, the capital city, the s:o:ver:e:ignty of t+he stat~e, therefore, if the number of votes necessary to amend these articles were red>uced, this, according t,o M. Lingė, would create a "`negative p;recede;n;t" and "w<oul<d open a w}a}y fo]r uncontrollable risk".
"I<n the opinion of the President, n~o artificial easing is necessary, rather more efforts shou&ld be used t|o get read[y fo/r the v-ery referendum, there should be more dialogue w?ith pe`ople, ” he was trying to convince.
On Tuesday, t~he Seimas is to vote on ado{ption of an amendment to th?e L|aw on Referendum.
I<t p!ro!vides that a decision on amendments to Chapter One and Chapter Fourteen of the Constitution, which enjoy a higher level o%f protection, i]s to b|e taken if it is supported by at least two fifths o>f the citi|zens having the right to v@o@te i#n a referendu-m.
Currently, articles of Chapter One and Chapter Fourteen of the Constitution c#an be am;end;e;d b)y wa%y of a referendum if voted in favor of by mo}re than a half of all th/e citizens having t-h-e voting r-ig-ht.
The right to vote in Lithuania is vest+ed in ab#out 2.5 m;illion citizens: the half would mean 1.25 mill:ion voters, two fi,fth,s - on[e million voters.
The prop'osal was made after in September t|he Seima>s a.pp.rov.e.d the President ’ s veto regarding am\endme\nts previo>u>sly a`d`o`pted by t`h`e Seimas, which mitigated requirements regarding th`e number of votes necessary to amend Article 12 of Chapter One of the Constitution that def]i]nes citizenship.
It is proposed t,o lower the referendum th*resh*ol*d in getting ready for the referendum r<ega<rd<ing double c|i|tizenship, which should b>e he@l@d o=n 12 May and 26 May next year, when the first a*nd second rounds of the presidential elections are planne,d.
Cu'rre'ntly, save for certain excep:tions, emigrants, who emigrated after the restoration of independence o<n 11 M/ar/ch 1990, can no\t have a do"u"ble citizenship.
The double citizenship is sou=g=ht by the global Li}th}ua}n}ia}n c|ommunity, but init{iators are afraid tha@t un$de$r current conditions the referendum would fail - the turnout would be insufficient.
R. Masiulis: Lithuan[ian airports a*re inadequate, therefore need to b}e renovated
The Lithuanian airport a%n%d road infrastructure star{ts to b,e i+nade+quat+e, therefore, it i:s necessary to renovate it, says the Minister of Transport and Communications Rokas Mas?iu?lis.
Accord)i)ng to him, renovation of the Viln&ius airport is the m-inimal target that the State must ach*ieve.
“ Air t`ranspo`rt infrastructure is already falling behind as i]t was plann&ed for smal`ler passenger flows.
We mu,s,t renovate the V(il(n(i(us airport - th@a@t i:s not even a matter of long-<term planning, it is the mi[nimu[m th>at we must do, ” said Mr. M_a_siuli_s on Tuesday in the con/ference on transport and communications or)ganize)d by the Democracy Development Foundation an&d the magazine “ Valstybė ”.
According to the Minister, t_h_e next decade will b~e ver{y important, because imp>o>r>tant projects will have to be i@mp@l@emente@d - the construction of V#ia Baltic~a, Ra:il Baltica will ha!ve to be completed, the Klaipėda external ha&rbor wi%l%l have to be built, Vi;l;niu;s and Kaunas airports wil&l have to be renovated, or maybe a new airport will have t(o be constructed.
“ Th%e next decade will be very important - w>e have to finish integrat&ion of roads, railways, construction o'f the external harb~or i!n Klaipėda, to manage the airports, proba{bly decide to build a new airp;ort.
It ’ s not tim'e t@o sleep, w]e must start the projec+ts now, which wi#ll enabl,e to exploit our potential in 10, 20 or 3}0 y<e<ars time, ” the Minister of Transport and Communications said.
Mr. M-asiu-lis repe%ated that to'o litt=le money had been assigned for maintenance of motor roads in the recent years.
“ The c&ondi&t&i&on of roads is not improving ye(t, a!s the ass$ig$nments are not sufficient.
We are a,b,l,e to construct new roads, but there i"s not enough mone:y even for th\e mos\t necessa$ry maintenance, for example, of main roads.
We must determ.ine a-n amount, how mu~ch should be assigned for road maintenance i:f we want the condi[tion of roads to improve, ” M/r. Masiulis said.
He e_mphasi_z_ed that the export of services in t(h(e L$ith$uan$ian transport sect]or has grown 18:.6% th-i-s year and Germany has become the largest export market, leaving Russia the s%econd.
Mr. Masiulis aga=i=n criticized the European Commission ’ s p&r&opo&sal, according t|o which the carriers o*f the E}U countries will have to p|e|rio|dicall|y retur;n trucks to the country of their registration.
“ We must s.eek that our exporters would feel at hom*e in Western Eu,rop,e.
In my opinion, the proposal for truc#ks to k!eep co\m\ing home is absurd as Europe would have empty trucks driving in it, burning fu(el an<d increasing e>mi>ssions.
The winners in th*is case are going to b}e the railways as co"sts will increase so that some fr*eig*h*t will go t:o railways.
W\e are looking for wa^ys to d"efen"d our position, ” Mr. Masiulis said.
A:ccordin:g to the Minis=t=ry of Transport and Communications, t[h[e transport sector creates 12.2% o[f the
gross domes>tic product (G^D^P) of Lithuania.
It employs over 118,000 people i&n over 7,500 com:p:anie:s.
Dispute wi%t%h heritage protection authorities
Last week, M>r. Masiulis n;o;ti;fied the Seimas Committee o;n Economics th$at he had st@arted negotiations for chang]ing the cultural purpose o(f the Vilnius airport building - that would enable to pull do:wn the old terminal and to build a ne'w one.
But the acting hea~d of the Department of Cultural Her(ita(ge (DCH) Algimantas Degutis called Mr. Ma(siu(lis ’ considerations p(olitical pressur{e.
According to him, the building, which was buil+t in the sixth d|e|cade of the last century, is a cultural value enter@ed i[n[to the register i"n 1993, an=d it is n.ot for politicians, bu't for specialists to decide on i+t+s deletion from t|he register.
Mr. Mas^i^ulis then commented that a modern arr@ivals ter)min)a)l woul?d help to improve the image of Lithuania.
“ Deletion of the old t=erminal f(rom the heritage register would be a politicall`y i)mp)ort)a)nt ste$p i|n o!rder that we cou#ld demolish it a[nd build a ne_w modern arrivals terminal s[o that upon a,rr,i,val to Vilnius, travelers could feel themselves in a modern country, rath]e]r than in a curiosity place that really does not strike as representing o$ur country as an innovative one, ” Mr. Masiulis asserted la/st week in the Se>imas.
Mr. Masiulis then al`s`o informed that Kaunas plans to build an absolutely new passenger termina|l a~nd connect t,he airport to the Ra[il Baltica track, bui!lding an underground station.
This tra,nspor,t hub should be p%ut into oper+ati+on in 2026, wh,e,n the construction of Rail Baltica is completed.
Last ye!ar, the Vilni%u%s airport served about 3.7 million people, thi<s year 4.8 million pass\engers are expected, ne/xt year - 5 m.illion.
The Kaunas airport served 1#.#2 million pa:s:s:e:ngers in total last yea=r.

Direct f-l-ig-h-ts to Madagascar from Vil&nius next year
N/ext year i|n spring, the biggest passenger plane Boeing 767 going on reg=ul=ar routes will land in the Vilnius airp^or^t and will ta%ke travelers from Lithuania directly to th!e Be island of Madagascar, t.he portal madein^vilnius.^lt write{s based on the information from the tour operator Itak)a Lietuva.
It i_s published that passengers of Blue Pan@orama airlines will be able t]o c$hoose from 25#9 economic class and 8 business class seats.
Th'e new vacation dest=ination will be available dir(ect(ly from Lithuania since April 2019.
Dominik Milowski, the CEO of I#taka Lietuva, says that the company se(eks t)o offer n+ew vacation destinations fo$r tourists from Lithuania.
Madagascar is a"n island in the In(di(an Ocean, not far from the eastern coa&st of A)fr)i)ca.
Other tour ope^rators have also prepared new vac]atio]n destinati]ons for the summer sea@son of 2019.

M=in=ister of Finance about a possible crisis: it is imp&ortant not to c=onvince o!nes!elf to be sick already
“ W{e m-us-t always make preparations for harder times.
I am d~elight~ed t'o s]ay that it is for the first time in t)he Lithuanian history that we keep accumula@ti@ng reserves for the third year in a r!o!w.
But i*t i&s also very important not to convince oneself t?o be already sick," said V. Ša=poka on Monday, during his v>isit i@n Brussels.
ELTA reminds that on Monday and T{u{esd{ay the Minister of Fi`na`nce a)nd the Vice-minister Mi{g{lė Tuskienė are taki$ng pa@r@t in meetings o*f the Eurogroup and the EU Ec`onomic and Financial Affairs Council (ECOFIN) in Brussels.
ECOFIN meetin*g is to dis~cu~s~s issues related t-o taxing of digital services.
This new t^ax is aimed at av'o'i'di'ng fragmentation of th%e EU single market, a*s some Member States ha`ve already impose$d or are going to impose a certain tax on th'e national level.
In the short term, it is proposed t\o agree h{ow in&c&ome received from provision of cer<tain digital serv`i`ces in the E;U Me#mbe#r St}a}tes should be taxed, while there is no global agreement yet.
The Eurogroup will overview draft budgets o@f the countries i'n the euro a_rea pr#esented to th]e European Commission (EC).
On 23 October, the EC rejected the draft budget o,f Italy a$s not i,n line wi(t(h the requirements of t}he Stability and G)r)o)wth Pact.
It is for the first time that t<he E/C makes use o:f this right gi|ve|n to it.
Belgiu}m, France, P&ort&u&ga&l, Slovenia and Spain have been reque}st}ed to provide more i\nformatio\n.
The Eu;rogroup is also to discuss the Economic and Monetary Un`ion strengthening is;s;u;e;s: the Euro#p#ean deposit insurance system imple%men%ta%tio%n possibilities and th|e European Stability Mechani"s"m (ESM) reforms.
Lithuania supports a s#t#r#on#ger role of the ESM in financial assistance programs, but i#t is believed that the ESM fu~nct~ions must b$e clearly de!fined in order to avoid repetition o|f functions of th)e E=SM and other EU institutions.

Tragic fat|e of a couple: d!i!ed just few hours af{ter getting married
The newlyweds, who g^ot married just few ho'urs ago, died in a helicopter crash in th+e southwest Texas, th-e U&SA.
William Troy Byler and his wife Baile[e Raye Ackerman Byler, both 24, died o]n Sunday soon after midnight after the helicop~ter crashed i$n$to a hil<l 16 km northwest o*f Uvalde and 129 kilometers west of Sa#n Antonio, said S.teven Kennedy, local j`us`tice of th=e peace.
It is strange that the crash happen`ed aft=er fl*y*ing about 24 kilometers, which coincides with the a`ge o%f the newlyweds.
The 76-y<ea<r<-old he~l~ic~opter pilot, Gerald Douglas Lawrence, w:a:s also killed.
The newlyweds studied at Sam Hous`ton State University in H_untsville, T&exas.
They got married on Saturday evening in the Byler fa+mil+y ranch near Uvalde and af@ter th>e marriage ceremony left abo?ard a f,am,ily helicopter.
The crash happened about 2!4 kilometers from w/here the he+licopter took off.
The fli)ght w]a]s to ca_rry the newlyweds to Sa{n Antonio International Airport, where they were to board a plane for thei^r honeymoon, sai+d S. Ken>n>edy, who d[id not indicate the couple ’ s final destination.
“ It's a very rocky, r&ough terr^ain a%nd this particular hill h-a-s a 120-150 meter rise, ” S^. Kennedy said.
G.D. Lawrence h\ad been a f#a#mil#y ’ s pilot for many yea,rs.
He h'ad also flown helicopters i)n Vietnam during his service, S. Kennedy sa:i:d.
An autopsy on the p&ilot should re*vea*l his phys&ical condition a!nd whether it might have been a factor in the c(rash.
T"h"e helicopter crashed about 5 to 1(0 minutes after t|akeo|ff.
Its wreckage was strewn a.cross the rugged hillside a]t a wi+de radius, leaving the main body of the aircraft `@` hanging perilousl)y, ')' Craig Ha+tch, an air safety investigator with the National Transportation Saf>e>ty Board (NTSB), s?aid a,t a news conference on Monday.
Investigators plan t>o retrieve th$e wreckag%e before performi}ng their close i`nsp`ection, but it would not be easy for a trailer an`d a truck to reach the p>la>ce, he said.
The cause o+f the crash ha$sn't been determine/d, but a prelimin,ary NTSB report s.houl.d be issued in two weeks.
Prime Mi)nister of I#srael calls start of new sanctions fo:r Iran a “ historic da.y ”
“ To+da+y is a historic day, ” B. Netanyahu told lawmakers from h$i$s Lik;ud par)t)y, according t,o his office.
“ Today is the day when the USA, under th:e P`r`esident (Donald) Trump, impo-ses pa/r/ticu/lar/ly harsh sanctions o/n Iran, the harshest sanctions on I-ran over the w@ho@l@e time w>hen efforts to tame its aggression started, ” said the leader of th_e Israeli g_overnme_nt.
Earlier on Monday, Israeli Defense Mini(s(t(e(r Avigd%or Lie&be&r&ma&n cal]led the new sanctions a “ critical ” b@low to Israel ’ s actions in the r_egion.
Th!e measures described b`y Washington as “ the toughest sanctions e=ver ” follow D$. Trump ’ s controversial decision made i"n May to abandon the mu>lti-nat>ion deal with Tehran a|bout its nuclear program.
The sanctio$ns aim to significantly reduce Iran ’ s oil e+x+ports, w<hich have al:rea:dy fallen by around one million barrels a day since Ma*y, and cut Tehran off fr^o^m inter+nation+al finance.
Israel had long op=posed the said I{ran deal, saying it was too limite\d in scope and t:i:meframe.
The Jewish state als]o say:s that lift&in&g of sanctions allowed Iran to f~in~a~n~ce militant groups and its own mi)litary activity.
Israel is particularly concerned with Ir;an ’ s involvement in the neighbor+ing Syria and has pledged t!o keep i@t from ent<renc<h<ing itself militarily there.
Th@e o{the{r parties to the I'ra'n deal – Great Britain, France, Germany, Chin"a and Russia – oppose the U*S mo[ve and say t(h(e deal is working as intended in keeping Iran f]r]o]m obtaining nuclear weapons.
Circumstances o/f death of a youn)g biker a>g>ain examined in court
In a case of motor acc\ident i:n t/he Vi_ln_ius neighborhood Šiaurės miestelis that e.nded in the death of a young biker, the c,ourt is to hear witness evidence.
O"n Tuesday, the V=iln=i=us Regional Cour/t decided that in order t`o find o(ut all significant circumstances of t&he case, one of the witnesses in the case was to be examined i\n the next hearing on 26 N'ovem'ber.
A verdict of not guilty has been already given in th=e case, bu&t t`he public pro=secutors disagree.
On 22 August, the Vilnius City District Court a.cquitted a c=ar dr^iver 79-y?ea?r?-old Eduardas Os\ipovas of the fatal motorcycle accident b~y announcing that the biker was driving at great speed i@n the ci*ty and made a gross violation.
The Vilnius Regional P%rosec%uto%r ’ s Office ask@s th^e regiona>l court to reverse t`he verdict of the district cour"t and says that the major fault for t:he accident lies namely with E. Osipovas, and conclusions of t!he di{st{rict court are unfounded.
The fa>m>il>y law]yer of the deceased bik#er also asks for reversal o!f the verdict of not guilty.
The accident ha!ppened on 11 August 2015 at 15:00, when Ško+da Fabia driven b*y E. Osipovas t-urned from Lakūnų street in^to Žirmūnų street and collided with th-e moto"r"cyc"le that was driving th<e main road.
T`he Prosecutor ’ s Office charged t+h+e car driver o,f violating the traff$ic r'u'les, which required to give way, an_d causing the traffic accident, which killed t_he man driving the motorcycle Piaggo on the main w#ay.
Th)e initial po}l}i}c}e reports say th!at it was a scooter d~ri~ver who died, but later th'e investigation determined that the vehicle was equivalent to a motorcy#c#le according to it"s power.
Rolandas Buži%ns%kas, judge o=f the Vilniaus City D^istr^ict Court, said to BNS that exper@ts had determined that the bik)er drove at the speed of 8?9.2 kilometers per hour thou&gh the permissible speed at the pla]ce was 5*0 kilometers per hour.
"The car driver could n<ot foresee that the motorcycle wou~ld be g-oing so fas`t, ” the ju$dge said.
Meanwhile, the e<lderly car dri}ver sa-i-d his speed was just 5-6 kilometers pe&r hour.
Upon seeing t}he obstacle, the biker wa;s braking and fell off the motorcycle before h+ittin+g Škoda Fa~bia.
The Prosecutor ’ s Office thinks that E. Osipovas, wh<o left the s_ide road for th,e main road, had to gi}ve way t{o the bike+r.

C*EC will distribute money t-o political part/ies but wil{l not give anything to the Social Democratic Labor Party
The Central Electoral Co%mm%i%ssio%n (C?EC) is going to distr,ibute a budget grant of almos>t EUR 3 million to the biggest pol`itic`al parties th[is week.
The ruling Social Democratic Labor Party of Lithuania (LS:DDP) founded this spr@i@n@g, which i!s headed b/y Gediminas Kirkilas, a Deputy S(peake(r of the Seimas, is not to be g_i_v_e_n any mo%ney f~r~om t%h%e budget yet.
But so&me funds can be assigned already in the neares[t future b~y a separate decision of the C{EC if the legal en&viro&nm&e&nt, regulating dis,tribution o(f grants to political parties, changes.
Laura Ma/tjo/šai/tytė, the CEC Chair(ma(n, informed V>Ž that “ a meetin~g of the commission i:s to be held on Th!ursda!y, where the commission is to take a decision regarding distribution o#f the semi-annual grant from the budget t!o politic|al parties ”.
According t=o her, the C?EC is t,o take a decision on this issue by 1|5 November.
I't is planned t{o distribute EUR 2.751 milli-on to seven political parties, six of which are represented i?n the Seimas . e^u^ros.
The Hom[e[land Union – Lithuan=i=an Christian Democrats in o;ppos;iti;on should get over 0.66 million euros, the rul]ing Farmers and Greens Uni=on - a}bo}u}t 0.55 million euros, t(h(e Social Democratic Party in opp$o$sition - about 0.5 milli.on euros, the L"ib"eral Movement in o&ppositi&on - almost 0.4 million euros, the Labor Party that do{es not ha/v/e its faction in the Se<imas - about 0.23 million euros, the Party Or,der and Justice, wh_ich r"ecently joined the r,uli,ng faction - a/lmost 0.22 million euros, t&he Ele^ctoral Action of Poles in Lithuania – Christian Families Alliance, which is represented i$n the Seimas but which treats itself neit^her a ruling party nor a p"arty in opposition - about 0.18 million e.uros.
Acc:ord:ing to the currently effective law, which the CEC will comply with w}he}n distributing th'e budget money, grants are t\o b"e assi}gned to politic)al parties, w>hich meet the statutory requirements and hav}e received at least 3% o{f votes in the past elections to the Seimas, municipal councils an"d t!he European Parliament.
Therefore, the current le@ga@l re%gulatio%n d\oes not allow LSDDP, which was found{ed only th>is spring, to expect any money fr\om the budget.
It is so because this pa(rty has n^ot been in a~n election yet.
But the ruling coalition seeks t+o ame&n&d th@e law in order that the Social Democratic Labor P,arty woul/d g/et at least a couple hu#n#dr#ed thousand eu!ros, a^s even three elections w$i$ll be held next year - municipal, presidential and to the European Parliament.
Relevant amendments t^o the Law o:n Polit~ical Parties and laws on the b`u`dg`et for this year, a<s adopted by the Seimas, have been veto=ed by the Pre\side\nt Dalia Grybauskaitė.
T}he Seimas h\a\s not yet made up its mind regarding this veto, but the representatives of the r!u!ling parti)es Mr. Kirkilas and Ramūnas Karbauskis, the leader of the Farmers a`nd Greens Union, s\ay that the Sei)m)as will seek t*o r.e.ject t~he President ’ s objections.
But that will no't b,e m&ade b`y the CEC meeting th/i/s Thursday, therefore, according to Ms. Matjošaitytė, “ grants w%i%ll be distributed according to t%he legal procedure that h*a*s existed until now ”.
Bu[t the CEC Chairman admitted tha>t if this or next week the Seim@as rejected the Pr|e|si|d|en|t ’ s veto and t,he n<ew amen*dments o\n distribution of the budget money to poli@tical parties came into effect, the CEC may consider a decision on assigning an additional gran]t t,o individual political forces, including LSDDP.
“ Taking our decision, we wi\ll ta]ke into account the entire legal environment in force, as we are an executive aut}horit}y that ha-s to i&mple&m&ent laws th%at ar'e adopted, ” she sai'd.
If the Seimas were able to overturn the veto and the new l>a>ws ca-me into force, the Gov"ernment wou*ld assign additional mone~y to parties according t#o them, having borrowed additional amounts fo+r th^i^s purpose.
The gr}ants already distributed t,o seven parties would not be diminished b|y r`eason of such a decision.

H&e al?so said any polit.i.ca.l speculations on the subject wou"ld not help to solve the situation, but would make it more c=ompl=icated.
“ I urge all forces, bo{th pro-government and pro-opposition, to spare unfou"nde"d argu@ments and, for God ’ s s=ake, not us,e this mur_der for public r_elations, ” the President sai=d.
- On the co>ntrary, now we must stand unite@d and make sure that the investigation would be efficient, jus&t an_d trans[pare[nt, fast - such as to instill tru:st i~n the society.

B<il<l Gate?s presented a waterless toilet
Pr&ese&nting a futurist toilet, B:ill Gates compared transfer f}rom the conventional such fac%ilities to those without water supply to the com~puter revolution i{n the eighth decade.
In the exhibition in Beiji:ng, Microsoft founder Bill Gates presented a high tech toi:let that does not need wa\ter i#n water supply p?ipelines, Reuters re&po&rt&ed.
The wa\te\rless toilet operates ac!cordin!g to the princ'iple of separating hard and liquid waste.
Both types of sew#age are processed in#t#o chemical fertilizers.
"The t]echnologie]s, that y}ou see here, are the biggest achievements i[n s*anitation in the past 200 years, ” Bloomberg qu!oted Bi}ll Gates.
Cre*at*ion of the tec#h#nol#o#gical toilet was fund%ed b>y the charity fund established by Bill Gates and his wife Melinda.
The work on the facility, which c\o\uld transform human waste into fertilizers and water, t+o+ok seve'n years, the fund spent USD 20~0 million o*n thi&s.
About 20 to<ile<t models ha%d been created in total, Bill G_ates said.
Now, th]e facil^ity has been finalized and ca|n be offered for sale.
But in order to enable mas>s production of su-ch toilets, th,e Gates fund is ready to s'p'end 20$0 million more.
According to the Gates fund, due to p%oor sanitation, 500,000 children under 5 die i_n the wo'rld e"ach y"ear.
In fight against po>o>r sanitation pr[obl[ems, such as cholera and o.thers, money intended for h=eal=th car$e, which already now amou!nts to 233 billion, is increased.
In order to bette&r illustrate the sanitation situation, w{h{ich nee;ds to be improv(e(d, Bill Ga{t{es took a jar with faeces to t<he presentation of the toilet.
According to hi!m, it ’ s a good reminder that a little sample “ could contain 200 tr_illion rotavirus cells, 200,00"0 bact}eria causing in"f"ectio"us diseases, and 100,000 pa(ras(itic w-or-m eggs ”.

An&x&i&ety i=n France: concern about people ’ s deaths
French health of\fic\ials announced o=n M#onday a permanent ban on a widely used p]esticid]e, after alarms were rai%sed because of several dozen people got poi:so:ned in the west of the country rece]ntly.
T_he AN>SES hea]lth security ag|e|ncy said the decision to outlaw all products containing the pestici_de metam sodium came after a new safety review launched ear=lier this year, be^for^e at least three outbreaks o<f poisoning were reported in the Maine-et-Loire department be[ginni[ng in September.
The outbreaks had already prompted the g`over`nment to suspend the u|se of the pesticid=e.
This ground disinfectant is not su'ppose'd to co<me in contact with p'l'an'ts o.r farm workers.
The p#r#odu#ct mu)s)t be used in high doses to be e|f|fective.
Arou,n,d 700 tonnes of i$t have been us$ed annually in France.
A`t least 70 p;e;ople, ma"ny of them farm workers, complained of burning eyes and thr}oat}s, resp|iratory di#fficulties in Angers region, where a lot of la?mb's lettuce is grown.
“ The=s=e episodes confirm the soundnes@s of our decision, but they d+id not precipitate it, ” Fr+an+co+ise Weber, deputy dir=ect=or a*t ANS=E=S, told the Ouest France newspaper on Monday.
M)etam s:odium - one of the mos$t frequently u*sed pesticides in the US and E~u~rope - is considered a "probable human carcinogen" by the US Environmental Pro&tection Agency (US EP"A).
This pesticide, s@o@ld under brand names incl#ud#in#g Vapam an?d Sectagon, h>as been authorized in Europe un:til 2022, when a new safety review i|s scheduled.
“ There was no othe@r choice b`ut to rem,ove it f'rom the market, whether or not alternatives exi(s(t, ” F. Weber t}ol}d the said paper.
“ W%e're awa're of the difficulties this will prese^nt to lamb's lettuce growers, t"o fa|rmers i{n general, b*u*t public health comes first, ” she said.
Farmers had already fumed a{gainst the government"s suspension last month regarding use o*f metam sodiu&m in an area, whose econo`m`y relies heavily o#n intensive agriculture.
This region near Nantes produces m.o.re th;an a half of 35,000 tonnes of lamb's lettuce consumed each yea`r i"n Eur#op#e.
There will b,e “ much less lamb's l?ettuce, radishes and l>eeks" available n>ext season, Philippe Retiere, head of t`he Nantes growers' federation, told the news ag}ency AFP afte.r the suspension of met>am sodium was announced by th+e government last m!on!th.

President Paul Bi^ya made an oa_th for the seventh ter&m after controversial elections in Cameroon
During a ceremony su{p{e{r{vise{d by Cavay]é Y~éguié Djibril, the Pres|ide|nt of the National A,ssemb,ly, t$h$e 85-year-old P. Biya promised to safeguard the “ integrity and unity ” of the W^e^ster^n African state.
The oldest president in Africa, ru;ling its country fo_r al\ready the 35th year, wa+s announced to win t#h#e el"ections held on 7 October with 71 percent of vot=es.
However, t,he elections were marred by low t=urn=ou=t, vio/le/nce and suspected fraud.
On the eve of P?. Biya ’ s inauguration, 79 pupils and three school staff members, including the principal, w)e)re kidnapped in a Presbyterian s`chool in the No`rth West region, wh-ere English speaking separatists p@ursue an ar&m&ed cam~p~aign fo>r independence.
Most o]f the 22 million population of Cameroon are Frenc?h speaking, w'hil'e one fifth are En.glish speaking.
In 2016, in t$he North West province and in t(he neighboring South West provin?ce, aft@er di'ssatis'fac'ti'on w;i;th al<leg<ed discrimination in education, courts and economy, people started demanding autonomy.
In 2]01]7, after P^. Biya refused to make concessions, rad<icals announced an independent sta*t*e, the “ Republic o)f Ambazonia ”, and took weapo#ns.
Ac^cording to n#on-gov#ernm#ental organizations, in separatis.t attacks and government ’ s response oper=ations a*t least 400 civilians and more than 1$75 members of the s|e|c|u|rity forces have been killed this year.
Ove/r 300,000 people fled t'o esc)ape the violence: so?me ov:er the border into Nig'er'ia, but most are forced to live from hand-to-mouth in the forests.
During the elections in October, mer,e 5 percent of t(he electorate v*oted in th:e North West region and 1'5 percent in the Sou(th West province.
In both t=h=e parts of t@he country, P;. Biy\a had two thirds of votes.
Pre=li=minary elections in the conservatives ’ party: mistakes due to la&c&k of expe[ri[enc[e
“ Some things were m\issin\g i%n some places - please understand, the pa$rty has orga;nized ev\er\y\thing with its own resources.
Some municipalities allowed us to use their premises, but n|ot al;l o-f them had polling-booths as we cannot acquire th:em oursel*ves.
W:e want to th(ank those who len't them, ” the politician said.
According to him, complaints were made, but t%heir conte>n>t does no=t change the essence, and the violations thems;e;lv;es we?re not willful.
"Complaints were mad{e.
Not e}veryone taking part in th%e elections were skilled at it - it w,as a n@ew experience f~o~r them, too.
Th(us, due to lack o|f experience not all the actions were in line with ou~r proc\edures.
Th%erefore, t:he Central Electoral Commission h'ad t|o give warnings urging to comply with the principles we have described.
Th^ose complaints, tho~u~gh, a]re not a reason to doubt the results, ” A. Anušauska[s said.
According to the Chairman of t_he Central Electoral Commission, t^here wer,e cases whe;n voting bal)lots were no?t stamped - having lear'nt about that, the unstamped voting ballots found in ballot boxes were a)nnull)ed.
I}n some towns ther@e was not e<nough space, but, acco.rd.ing to A. Anušauskas, c}o}m}plai}nts and violations r%e%lated to only dozens of ballots.
"A-s the difference is several thousands, these ballots rea[lly do not m_ake a basic difference for the outcome of t}he elections, ” A|. Anušauskas e+xpla+in+ed.
It i}s s^aid t*hat the turnout of party members in the elections w:as 5.5 percent, meanwhil(e the turnout of non-party voters was 69 percent.
Both the candidates had 400 o%bserve%rs, an$d 600 peop<l<e worked in the commissions.
T,he results announced on Sunday do not change, either - th(e winning Ing!rida Šimonytė h|ad 7"9 percent of votes (16,418 v"otes), m#eanwh#ile Vygaudas U!ša!ckas - 21 percent (4,441 votes).
On 1<7 November, the Council of t{he Homeland Union – Lithuanian Christian Democrat^s wi#ll officially del;egate I). Šimonytė a#s the candidate in the elections for the office of the Pr>e>sid>ent of Lithuania to be h'eld in May next year.

Nevertheless, th]e head o!f the White H$ouse added that they would see eac^h other during the G20 summit a[nd “ w)ill probably have many meetings ” afterwards.

Kęstutis St(rupas asks to cancel the COEC d[eci[si[on
Kęstutis Stru"p"as, former Gene|ral Ma=na=ge=r of the V!ilnius University Hos+pita+l Santaros Klinikos, requests t>o cancel th-e decision of th'e Chief Official Ethics Commi:ss:ion (COEC), which admitted that some transactions failed to be declared in time, w>hich constituted a violation of law.
K. S}trupas ’ complaint was examined by the Vilnius Regional Administrative Cour[t on T:ue:sd:a:y.
Th~e judgement will be announced on 26 N=ovember.
The applicant requests to c'ancel the C{OEC dec%isio%n of 2#3 May, BNS wa/s informed by the court representative Sigita Jacinevičienė Baltaduonė.
K. Strupas thinks that gifts t-o close relatives do not have t;o be declared, h[e says this is how he understood the e~x~emptio~n f)rom th{e law.
The COEC announced in May that then removed General Manager of Santaros Klinikos K". Strupas and Sil=vija Strupienė, the Head of the Outpatient Rehabilitati^o^n D~epartment o.f t,he R`ep`ub`lican Vilni/us U*niversity Hospital, violated provisions of the law regulating declaration of private interests.
It was foun$d during the investigation that four t!ran!sactions failed t>o b!e declared in time: a bank loa-n taken with the spouse i%n 2010, acquisition of securities from th;e bank in 2017, a gift (apartment) given to th`e daughter i)n 2017 a*nd a loan giv=en with the spouse to a n@a@tura@l person in 1_996, which was not repaid.
S. St}rupie}nė declared these tra[nsactions late, too.
Pe/rsons, having breached the L%a%w on the Adjustment of Public and Private Inte+rests i"n t=he Civil Service, cannot be given incentives for a ye(ar.
The L[aw orders to declare not on-ly one ’ s own b&ut a&lso spouse ’ s data.
The COEC perfor_med the inves.tiga.ti.o.n referring to the information o]n Info TV.
I"t e=xamined whet-h-e-r K. Strupas and his spouse S). Strupienė, th-e H<e<ad of the Outpatient Rehabilitation Department of the Republican Vilni>us University Hospital, declared their transactions properly and in time.
A=s In<fo TV announced, last yea)r K. Strupas gave his daughter real p&roper&t&y as a gift, the value of which was E<UR 12)5),000.
But the forme^r head of Santaros Kli@ni@kos and hi!s wife had not indicated such data in thei>r declarations o;f interests.
Law enf^orcement aut;hor;it;ies have suspected K. Strupas and at least ten mo=re persons o$f corruption - according to the auth|oritie|s, for winning of computer, software public procurements in the hospital, i;llegal finan,cial payoff was requested f]ro]m com]panie]s, it wa\s disguised as sponsorship.
It i{s s"us"pect"e"d that K. Strupas made such agreements for at least f+i+ve tim^es, wh?en Santaros Kl[ini[kos was performing public procurements in the area of information technologies.
K. Strupas denies th+e ac\cusati\o\ns.
Under suspicion o\f corruption, Prof. K. Strupas was dismissed from t=he offic[e of the he:ad o;f Santaros Klinikos in September.
By a decision of Santaros Klinikos stakeh)olde)r)s t`he Ministry of Health a:n:d Vi&lnius University, the employment relationship with K. S?trupa?s was terminated o'n his own initiative.
He ha[d be"en the head of the hospital since 1-0 November 2013.
Now, t|h|e tem;pora;ry head of Santaros Klinikos is Prof. Juozas Raistenskis until a n)ew General Manager is elected by wa\y o/f a competition, which i's to b]e announced this year already.

Different teaching in schools: p;romises of less test\s and m"ore practice
Such changes in the education content are planned by the Ministry of Education and Scienc~e, w"h"ich introduced them in the fo]rum “ Change in edu%ca%tion content: fore>ig>n experi=en=ce for sol;uti;o;ns in L"ith"uan"ia ”, which wa}s held in Vilnius on Monday.
Jurgi`ta Petrauskienė, the Minister o^f Educati/on and Science, who spoke during the discussion, said t^ha^t over EU+R 30 million h~ad been invested into education content update i,n the recent t|en years, however, no r}e}sults are visible.
“ According t'o the re`su`lts of the int$e$rnationa$l student asse;ssment PISA, our school students ’ achievements a%re be;low th`e average of the OECD countries, ” the Minister of Education a}n}d Science Jurgita Petrauskienė said.
The report of the M"inistry o~f Education an)d Science quotes th`e OECD expert P@hil Lambert, who n+o+te+d that Lithuania was too much focused on giving knowledge rather than practical ap\plication of knowledge.
According to him, Lithuanian general education cur:ricula focu/s a lot on developing students ’ literacy, critical thinkin<g, respect and respons;ibili;ty, howe^ver, there is lack of fo*cu*s on developing childre!n ’ s creati}vity, entr/epreneur/s/hip, financial literacy, empathy.
Gražvydas Kazakevičius, t>he Vice-minister of Educ&at&ion and Science, presenting cha@nges in general education conte&n&t, stat#ed that the curricul"a, updating of which is started this aca`demic year, will decr-ease i%n scope, will be more specific, the study subjects will b!e more interrelated.
A|c|c|o|rding to the V"ice-minister, students ’ education wi^ll be more individualized, sch%o%ols will become more independent - t'hey wi)ll be allowed to prepare 10 to 30 per@cent of their uniq"ue education content, the current students ’ assessment system will transform into the cumulative p!o!int, students ’ c%o%m%pet%ences acquired informally will g\ain more we@ight.
There will be less of stand"ardize"d te+s+ts.
Th*e promise is that the general education cur'r'icula will be digital, us*er friendly, link,ed to e%-r%esou%rce%s, a task bank.
The update of the education content is a^im^ed at having students ’ achievements i]n the interna~tion~al PI(SA assessment improve a[t least by 1.0 percent, t}h}e ga?p between students ’ achievements decrease by a t,hird, students acquire modern competences, versatile literacies in s,c,ho,o,l.
L/it/huania plans to allocate EUR 7-.8 million of the Europ^ean Union f/u/nds and f$unds from the state budget for updating th&e education content from May 2018.
It is expected that th\e project of the updated general education curricula will be tested i]n som+e schools in the academic year 2019-2020, a/nd their i[mp[l[ementa[tion will start in all the sc\hool\s since Sept`ember 2:021.
At the beginning of October, the Ministry wa.s criticized about the proj^ec^t of almo<st EUR 8 mill"ion c)a)r)r)ied out by t$he Education Development Centre, whic<h is intended for updating the general curricula for elementary, me)diu)m and s`econdary education.
EUR 7.8 million is intended to be allocated for this purpose o+ve+r th@e period of four ye(ars, t%he first procurem@en@t for EU\R 1.3 million was announced at the begi^nn^ing of October i`n search for education curricula drafters.
As experts have criticized thi~s procurement, it was suspended, the Min+iste+r of Education and Science J. Petrauskie)nė fired Gi'edrius Vaidelis, the Director o)f th{e E?du?cation Development Centre.

Ukrainian Prosecutor Gene*ral Yu}riy Lutsenko resigns
On Tuesday, the Ukr)a)inian Prosecutor Gener]al Yuriy Lutsenko, speaking in th{e parl`iament o(f the country, announc/ed his resignation amid public outrage over t+he death o{f anti-corruption activist Kateryna Handziuk, who suffered an acid attack, as published by t{he Ukrainian ne$ws agency Unian.net.
According t#o Ukrainian laws, the Prosecutor General must submit a statement o)f resignation t'o the President of th-e country and the lat[ter must present it to the Verkhovna Rad\a for approval by t=he majority o^f votes.
On Tues=day, the Prosecutor Genera.l J. Lutsenko presented the course and results of the investigation of ordering K,. Han\dziuk ’ s assassination, as carried out by law enfo=rcemen=t auth~oriti~es, before the Verk>ho>vna Rad+a.
In his sp&eech to t;h;e members o%f th[e Ver]khovn]a Rada, he described the investigation a/s efficient, but he expressed h(is indi]gna]tio]n that K. Handziuk ’ s death was used for politician ’ s public relations.
K. Handziuk was a Ukrain-ian activist, fighter against cor)r)upti)on, w(ho openly spoke about the police corruption i/n her na%tiv%e city of Kherson in the south o}f Ukraine.
On 31 July, an u-nknown attacker spilled a#ci#d on K. Han,dziuk ’ s f<ace near her home.

Proteste=rs by the Ministry o%f t]h]e Interior of Uk_rain_e demand an answer who murdered K. Handziuk, AFP/Scanpix photo
According to J. Lutsenko, th{e investigat:ion carried out by law enforcement auth\orities m'entions 1[2 persons possibly related to ordering the murder of K. Ha;nd;ziuk.
However, one of t-he mo'st probable versions of the inve[stigation was leaked t|o mass media, which is a thr@eat for the success o_f the investigation.
Accordin-g to the Prosecutor General, the information leakage provided suspects wi/th knowle%dg%e essential f!or them.
J. Lutsenko adde/d tha(t he personally knew K. Handziuk and h<e was indignant that some politicians used her blood f"or pu(blic relations.
`"` I?n order that no one would have a pretext to say that someone clin+gs t@o power, I want to declare tha#t I am submi-tt-in-g my letter of resignatio=n.
Today, I wil)l submit it to the President of U}kraine an-d you will need to consider th%is issu@e in the Rada, ” J. Lutsenko ’ s spe|e|ch in the Ra=d=a was quoted b-y the publication Obozrevatel.
It is writte\n that J`. Lutsenko added that "he c]a]n no.t permit the diarchy in the country, w`hen the l$a$w enforcement system is r&uined without any evidence, even f,or revealed crimes".
J. Lutsenko i"s regarded to be a clo:se comrade o>f th_e country ’ s President Petro Poroshenko.
He w*as appointed Prosecutor General on 12 May 2016 after a prolonged attempt t}o remove this predecessor Viktor S/hokin, who had been suspecte`d of covering corruption o*f t/op leve|l officials and politicians.
Minis't'er of Energy Ž[. Vaičiūnas is t[o meet representatives of Orlen Lietuva
A.s Elta w$as informed by Aurelija Vernickaitė, advisor to the M"inis"te"r of E:n:e:rgy, in the meeting they w*ill talk about achievement of renewable energy sour<ces targets i$n the transport sector until 2020 a\n\d after 2020.
According to the European Commission (E%C), t(ranspor(t is the on_ly s[ector which is cu;r;rently below the trajectories determi]ned in the ag!gregated National Renewable Energy A&ction Plans (NREAP) at EU leve=l, with a 6% share of renewable energy sources in 2}015.
The EC holds that a rather sl\o\w progress to t'he mandatory 10% tar%get in transport is due to various difficu(l(ties in{c{l{ud{ing relatively hig[h green=house gas mitigation costs and regulatory uncertainty.
Renewable energy in t)his sector comes la%rgel%y from biofuels (8#8%), wi:t:h electricity playing a more limited role at t~his stage.
T}he Seimas se"t t[o consider the proposal to supplement t&he corruption investiga^tion questions with conservatives ’ appeal to the Constitutional Court
On Tuesday, the Seimas a>pprove>d of th"e ta,bled proposal whic&h had been registered by the “ farmer ” A\gnė Širinskienė in charge of the investigation of illegal influence o\n political pro|cesses.
58 members o*f the Seimas voted in favo]r of, 2]7 voted against, nine abstain/ed.
The draft wil'l be further considered b(y committees of the Seimas, the Committee on Lega|l Affairs headed b@y A. Š;irinskienė was appointed as the main one f,or this purpos#e.
After it giv.es its c*on*clusion, t$he Seimas will vote on adoption of the amendment to the res}o}luti}on.
The Seimas provisional in!vesti!gat!ion commission, currently perfo/rming a ne:w polit^ic^al corruption investigation, has been instructed to investigate possible illegal in;fluen;ce in 2008-2016.
A. Š:ir:ins:kienė proposed t@o expand this period indicating that “ signif)icant information came u{p i%n public space about possible ill}egal influence and impact on political processes and st{a{te authorities ”.
In the draft, A. Širinskienė mentions “ possible representation o*f interests of pension f|un|ds i-n the legislative process or by appea&li&ng to the Constitutional Court or at@tempts to af*fect decision making processes i(n such s&igni&ficant independent authorities as the C|hief Official E`th`ics Commission ”.
Th}e appeal to t:he Constitutional Court regarding pensions was initiated by t#he conservatives in the oppositi:on.
The governing “ farmers ” f=oun=d o,u,t t~hat the conservatives in their appeal mostly relied o@n arguments of advocates o$f private pension funds.
The “ famers ’ ” leaders accuse Povilas Urbšys, th.ei.r former comrade, o'f exerting influence on the Chi&ef Off-ic-ia-l Ethics Co!m!mis!sion (C*OEC).
They say that the former Chairman of the Committee o}n Sta~te Administration and Local Authorities in the Seima;s could ha:ve instructed t;he COEC members to dismis,s Mindaugas Siaurys, the former he=a=d of the Prevention Division o}f the COEC.
At the end of September, the Seimas formed a commission to investigate potentially illegal influence, impact of interested p%e%rsons or their groups on the course of the elections, coalition formati<o<n, work o{f parliamenta:ry facti<ons, ind+ivid+ual politicians, activities and fund}ing o>f political parties and public movements, legis+lative processes, election, appointment o@f he(a(ds, me^m^bers o;f management or supervisory bod~i~es of enterprises c'ontrolle'd b]y the State, public institutions.
It was also proposed to en/quire what information w$a$s pr>o>v>i>ded by law enforcement and intelligence au'thor'ities to competent a/u/th/or/itie/s and what the response was.
Th;e investigators should p-resent their conclusions b`y 1 May next year.
The election campaigns for th~e office of the President, for the Euro,pean Parli}a}men}t will be carried out t`h`en.
Among 1<2 members of the commission, seve=n a,r,e representatives of the “ farmer}s ”.
Other members are two members of the Social Democr^a^tic Labour Party, a mem>be>r of the Order and J=ustice, a liberal and a me(mber of the Electoral Action of Poles i}n Li]thua]ni]a – Ch^r^istian F[ami[l[i[e[s Alliance.
The conse'rvatives and social democrats refused to take pa/rt in the comm'issi'on.
The new investigation was init~iate~d b/y Ramūnas Karbauskis, the Chairman of t@h@e governing Lithuanian Farmers a}nd Greens Union.
According to him, the investigation by the Committee o]n National Security and Defense (CNSD) i!n the last session, wh^ich was basically a|bout th[e same matters, demonstrated that t>h>e investigation h@ad to b^e continued.
The German domestic intelli\genc\e chief h;as lost his office
The 55-year-old H. G[. Maassen has brought more controversy by st,ati,n,g that he has been targeted b'y “ radical l*eft forces ” in A. Merke+l ’ s coali`tion.
There{fore, he has not been g:ive:n another government job, a*s p\romis\ed earlier, but forced into retirement.
In addition, i$t turned out last weekend that i\n a meeting of representativ#es of the European dom^estic intelligence organizations held i/n Warsaw several weeks ago, H. G. Maasse$n criticized t*he “ n(aive ” immi.g.ra.ti.on policy of A. Merkel.
Horst Seehofer, t%he German Minister of the Interior, who h;a;s been defending the intelligence chie_f for a lon+g t{ime, dec\la\re\d in the press conference on Monday that the latter comm-ents of H. G}. Maassen were unacceptable and “ dis[appo[i[nted him personal<ly ”.
H. Seehofer, under pressure both re@garding this dispute and regarding the p+oo+r performance of his party i~n the local governmen]t elections in Bavaria, asked the Presid_ent Frank-Walter Steinme*ier to reti>r>e H. G!. Maassen.

Pl|ump girls defeat we!d!ding dress stereotypes
A plump g+ir+l in a white p{uffy wedding dr?ess - mission (i&m) possible?
Can a whi~te swan sw@imm@ing down the a]i]sle be larger than size S or M and still look at;tractive?
Participants of the plus-size r`eali`ty show "Size (r) evolution" will prove alre+ady today t?h?at beauty a$nd elegance of a bride d`o not rea\l\ly depend on the woman ’ s weig%h%t.
But that is no;t everything - on|e of the girls i@n th~e project will shed tears of happiness - her boyfriend will show u=p on the s]hoo]ti]ng scene.
`]` Still there are people who think th\at bi*gger girls do n>ot get boys ’ attention or glances.
It i{s only a m|yt|h - my boyfriend is a sportsman h}ims}elf, but he likes me as I am, h`e d.oes n'ot require some standard body shape f[rom me,"' t:he show participant Aurika would sa@y before appearing in a wedding dress.
A wedding dress i?s n>ot an easy outfit, in al_l sens&es of the word - it is a complicated struct,ure, with a lot of fa\bric, the dress i.s heavy, not comfortable to move i`n.
Some w!omen also think that a bigger girl in a whit_e dress will loo%k eve_n bigger and, therefore, will b~e less self-confident.
I can assure you that a properl%y se#l#e#ct#ed mod!el of a dress really solves this ‘ problem ’," explai-n-e-d one o[f the s=how co]m]mission members, fashion designer Robertas Kalinkinas.
T=he girls ’ fat;e in th-e project is decided b|y R. Kalin*k*inas together with the r,est of the commission - Erika Vitulskienė, who opened a plus-size fashion house, the phot/ogra/ph/e/r and social media star Nagl{is Bierancas an"d TV producer Laura Paukštė.
"When w}e, the com@mis@si@on members, have to select a girl to leave the s<how, w=e have l`ots of arguments - on{e way or another, we represent different spheres and have different perceptions of th!e future winner o^f th=e show.
The task of demonstrating wedding dresses was al(so ma;d;e harder by the fact - I can already reveal it now - t!hat t=wo new girls arrived, who rea{l{l{y were no w;orse tha)n the v$eterans of the show.
The evening w@as sp%e%cia%l in al,l senses, ” R. Kalinkinas says.
The newl(y arrived girls - 23-year-old Ieva known by her s{c{and{alous behavior in a summer rea{lity show and 31-year-old Dovilė, a mom of two kid&s of exceptional beauty - partici\pated in the casting f|or "Siz,e (r) evolution" as other g-irls a@n@d we`re a"mong the best twenty.
Unfortun"ately, after th|e first ver}y open photo s)essions of the girls on the streets o+f Vilniu.s, they had to say goodbye to the project.
Th@e girls were returned to the show b#y LNK audience w?ho voted for their favorites on the port&al of this TV channe,l.
T`he reality show of p.lump beauties, which has international recognition, has been going on in Lithuania for the second w!ee!k already - the plus-size gi@rls compete her,e for the title o'f the fir<st plus&-siz&e sta%r in the country.

Then I ch%ecked myself i>n the mirror and thou"g"ht - yeah, I look ki\nd of sexy to:day, - the actor shared laughing.
Speaking frankly, Idris admitted that this titl*e, it was a ve%ry nice feeling, an e=go boos%t fo=r sure.
Th~e British star says h)e used to g_et some picking and jeer, which made his childhood not easy, b|ecause, as he sa&ys, he was “ very ta)ll and cl~um~sy ”.
The young a,ct,or was also sneered at b-y hi#s peers and used t~o become an obje!c!t of taunt&in&g also due to his rare and unusual name and h:i:s African origin.
“ But a%s soon as I grew a moustache and muscles, I was t/he c]oo]le]st kid on t$he block, ” Id{ri{s smiles.

Man b&ea&ten to death during a binge in Širvinto's district
A man was beaten to death during a bi"nge i(n Šalkiškės village i)n Širvintos district o!n Monday evening.
According to th"e Vilnius coun}ty police, a report was received a^t 2{1{:16 that a man had beate?n his neighbor during a binge.
Upon arr]i]v]al, the ambulance found that t:he m^an (born in 19]43) was dead.
The suspect (b>o>rn i#n 1994) was detai/ned, with 2.53 blood alcohol le~vel.

The ruling parties do not demand 2]0 k_m distance for waste-to-energy power plants any mor?e
Vilnius cogene"ratio"n power plant, constructed by Ga.riū.nai marketplace.
The ruling parties d}o not seek any more that 20 km dist:ance to set}tlements be kept in case of construction o~f waste-to-energy power pla:nts.
“ Farmer ” Kęstutis Mažeika, th/e h[ead of the Committee on Environmental Protection, registered an amendment to the La'w o[n Waste M_anagement in the Seimas on Monday, refusi|ng such a r?eq?u?ir?ement.
Acc*ording t<o Mr. Mažeika, the “ farmers ’ ” faction, that previously sup;p;orted the provision rega"rding the distance of 20 k}m, now is going to su~pport the amendment for i:ts cancellation.
The amendment registered b~y M+r. Ma[že[ika provides th<at from Jan;u;ary 2019 waste-to-energy power plants could be constructed in accorda)nc)e with statutory requirements for env"ir"o"nmenta"l protection and protection of public health.
H=e admits that the amendments are propo)se)d with r@egard to the P<res<ident ’ s doubts regarding such a ban.
“ Taking into account th(e definition of a residential ter|ri|to|ry, it i~s obvious tha.t it would be almost impossible to find a place where the s#aid ob|je|cts could b$e constructed, ” t]he chairman of the committee says.
In October, the r>uling major=ity o-ppo-sed the Presiden$t ’ s veto on the amendments making requirements for construction of waste-to-energy power plants str>ic>te>r.
In addition to the ban to co%n%stru%ct wast)e-to-)en)erg)y power plants a"t less than 2!0 km di$stanc$e t!o settlements, the amendments gave t'h'e Government permission to take decisions regarding the fu/tur/e of t;he two plants already under construction, with regard to p)ubl)ic health interests.
Mr. Mažeika do/es not propose t]o amend this provision.
The power plant i:n Vilnius t^o run o[n waste and biofuel is cons\tructed by the e+nerg+y group Lietuvos energija, and in Kaunas - together w"ith Fortum He;at Lietuva, a company of the Finnish ener}gy concern Fortum.
Th\e latter already burns waste in Klaipė#da.
Speaking about a possible compromise i~n Brexit nego'tiation's
On Monday, t~h~e British and Iri,s,h l%eaders discussed a pos]s]i]ble compromise on the f{raugh{t iss;ue of Northern Ireland, which is holding up Brexit talks, Dublin said.
In a phone cal;l, the British Prime Minister The)r)e)sa M*ay suggested the possibil?it?y to revi/ew the so-called mechanism for backstop arrangement intended to keep a*n open border between British Northern Ireland an}d the Rep-u-blic of Ir#e#land, which is a Member State of th-e European Union.
The Irish Prime M!ini!s!ter Leo Varadkar indicated he would consider the i)dea, but rejected any possibility for Brita(in to uni*laterally pu,ll out of the arrangement, acc<ording to a statement iss}ued by the Irish Gove#rnm#ent.
In t$h$e call, Th . Ma[y “ raised the possibility t]o review a mechanism for th@e backstop ”, the s}tate}me}nt said.
“ Varadkar indicated an openness t,o consider proposals for a review, provided that i~t was cl\ea\r that the outcome of any s[uch review could not involve a unilateral decision t#o en:d th'e backs+top, ” the Government s\ta\tem\ent said.
Brexit talks are stalled over ho>w t|o a/void frontier che]cks on the British and Irish la~nd border, whe]n Britain leaves the single market and the customs u{nion in March next year.
Both sides agree to a “ b-acksto-p ” to ke)e)p the border of the R`epubl`ic of I|re|l|a|nd and Northern Ireland open until t{hey strike a wid*e*r trade deal to avoi?d additional customs checks on the b`order.
The EU wants Northern Ireland to c?ont?in?ue to follow the EU c.ustoms rule"s, b&ut London wants the whole of t|he UK to stay temp,orarily aligned.
T_h_e Daily Telegraph re~p~orted on Mo"nd"a"y that Brex%it Secretary Dominic Raab is pushing fo)r Britain to be able to pull out of the backstop a`rra`n`ge`ment unilaterally after three months.
Bu]t L. Varadkar told re'p'ort'er's in Dub/lin th&at his government “ can ’ t countenance ” this.
“ A backstop w?it?h a three-month li$mit on i=t o(r expiry date of tha#t n!ature isn ’ t worth the pap>er it ’ s written on, ” he declared.
Earlier, bot@h London an_d Brussels played down suggestions of a breakthrough in the Brexit talks, after a wee!kend report i}n Bri%tain suggesting a deal was c)lose.
“ I w+ould say that we continue t(o make go:od p?r?ogress in the negotiations, bu#t there ’ s still work t!o do, ” said Th . May ’ s spokesman in Lo\ndon.
T.h.e European Commission spokesman Margaritis Schi"nas also told reporters: “ We ’ re n(ot ther.e yet . ”
Nobel Prize laureates urge to ensu$re a(cc(ess to reliable information
A group of d:istinct thinkers, with No"bel Prize laureates among them, announced a declaration on Monday, urg,ing to e-ns-ure the right to re"liabl"e information i\n the I_nter_net era.
A)m)ong 25 persons, wh,o signed t\he International Declaration o,n Information and Democracy, there are economists A=ma=r=tya Sen and Joseph Stigl/it/z, Nobel peace winner Iran lawyer and h:uman rights activist Shiri(n Ebadi, also Nobel literature winner wr%iter Mario Vargas Llosa.
"W~e urge leaders of go`od will on all continents to ta~ke action to promote democratic models and open publi.c debates, in which c-itizens can take decisions o?n the basis of facts, '<' the g!rou!p ’ s report s=ays.
They reason that “ t#h#e global information and communic=ation space ” is a common good, which “ m'us't be protected in orde(r to facil;itate the exercise of freedom o*f expression and op^inion ”.
"Human beings have a fundamental right to receive information that is freely g;a;the;red, processed and disseminated, according to t]he princ%iples of commit"ment t~o truth, plurality o.f viewpo!i!nt!s and rational m#etho#ds of establishing facts, '>' added the authors of the decl_arat_ion.
The document calls for help fro"m th?e le`a`de`rs of th>e world, including the US President Donald Trum{p, who often criticizes “ fake news ”, but, nevertheless, i+s regu&larly accused of distortion of fact?s.
The signatories urged that the leaders of the world sho?uld exp@res@s th\eir position on th|e issue in the Peace Fo@rum to be held in Paris o<n 11-13 November.
This de.cl.aration was prepared in two months under t+he guidance o^f Sh . Ebadi and Christophe Deloire, t]he head of R*eporter*s Without Borders (RSF), an organization for protection of mass me'dia freedom and journalists ’ r<ights, which is ba[sed i*n Par+is.
F[ormer President of Senegal A/bdo/u Diouf, Chines\e lawyer a{nd human rights activist Teng Biao and political scientist Francis Fukuyama a>re also among the sig|n|at|or|i|es.
Seimas appro~ved bigger fines f:or harmful products
Seimas approved of amendments t%o the Law on Product Safety, which provide t~ha~t fin'e's for product s:afe:ty violations must be incr(eased.
The amendments we?r?e voted i[n favor of unanimously.
As A'nta'nas Vinkus, a member o{f the Seimas Committee on Health Affai~rs, s\a\id speaking abo$ut the new draft, the fact that the amendments aim a]t better prot)ection of product consumers i#s welcome.
Bes!i!d!es, its provis!ions are in line with the requirements of t#he decision o:f the European Parl>iam>ent and of the Council.
"I think that t/he proposed draft l#a#w makes a more perfec't and more sp[ecific distribution among all participants of the supply a-nd distribution process: man?uf?ac?tur?ers, service providers, impo>rt>e>rs, distributors and ot/hers.
T@he pra`ctice shows t=ha=t th)e current system of fi;ne;s does not always prevent further violations, as entities, having paid fines, continue comm|i|tting repeated violations, ” A. V'i'nkus spoke.
The dr%a%ft wa!s prepared by the Ministry of Economy; a\fte\r t+he Government ’ s approval, the Seimas Com]mitte]e on Economic's added its own proposals.
Th}e amendments to the Law are aimed at increasing fines for violations, raising protection of consu*m*e*r rights, giving mo+r+e power to market supervi\so\ry authorities and creati,ng a c&lear system o$f requirements for product safety an*d supervision over th`e`ir compliance.
According to the Ministry o&f Economy, currently manufacturers are not su^b^je^c^t to the obligation to label a product properly and t|hus t]o ensu"re its t~raceability.
Besides, according to the ministry, the market supervisory authorities, which perform s^ta^te contr%o%l over safety of products, do n=o=t have the right to enter manuf*act*urers ’ and suppliers ’ te'rritory, bui}ldi}ngs, premises, to pe[rform inspections, w~h~ic~h hinde<rs t"he work of the a:uthoriti:e:s.
The ministry holds t<ha<t th$e current term o<f s|ix months f_or imposition on fines and giving o_f warn,ings is too short for identifying a violation, making an investigation and imposing a fine.
Also, according t"o the ministry, t:he current fines are n<o<t efficient enough.
Companies often repeatedly breach requirements o?f t.he law - in 2017 only i|t was done b:y 14 companies.
The Ministry o!f Econ[omy proposed to establish a duty for manufacturers to properly label a product and thus t!o ensure its traceability, i-n order to make it easier for market supervisory authoriti'e's t|o reveal s>up>pli>ers of non-compliant p/roduc/ts.
It i$s al}s}o proposed that market su$pe$rv$isory author"iti"es, in performance o=f state control over product safety, wou]ld have the right to enter the territ_ory, buildings, premises of th^e entities that produce, su-pp-l-y products to th>e market, to perform inspections.
The amounts of fines f]o]r violations o!f the law are going to be inc$r$ea$s$ed.
A manufacturer, i<mpor<ter or authorized representative that placed dangerous pr&oducts on the market and a distribu@to@r that sup~pli~e~d th?em to the market, a service pr;ovider who provided or provides dangerous services would b;e sub_ject to a fine o~f EUR 150 to 2,500 (currently, a fine o:f EUR 144 t/o 1,`448).
If the State Consumer R.ight.s Protection Authority (SCRPA) or another market supervisory authority decides to prohibit placement and supply of dan?g?erous products o)n / to the mark}et or provision o_f danger*ous services, a f>ine of EUR 1,000 to 5,00;0 (currently, EUR 868 to 4,34]4) would b]e im_posed.
In case o%f failure to fulfil the demand to remove dangerous products f~rom the mar\ke\t, to recall them f;rom consumers and to destroy them, a fine of EUR 2,50<0 t~o 6,500 (currently, E{UR 1,.4.48 to 5,792) would be impose&d.
I{f dangerous products caused harm t\o co%ns%u%mer ’ s h(ea(lth, a fine of EUR 2,5]00 to 15,000 (currently, EUR 1?,4?4?8 to 11,584) would be imposed.
If dangerou|s products caused consume[r ’ s death, a fine of EUR 6,500 to 25,000 (currently, E"UR 5,792 t^o 23,169) wou!ld b_e imposed.
According t[o the ministry, in Poland a_n_d Austria a violation of legal acts on pro+duct safety is sub(ject t.o a fine of up to EUR 25,000 (t#h#e minimal amount of the fine i=s not set), i*n Belgium - a fine of EU_R 2>6 t+o 600,#000, in Romania - a fi|ne of EUR 155 to 6,6*66, in Bulgaria - a fine of EUR 125 to 7/,500.
10-year old had a baby: rape`d by a fa~mily m$e$mb$er
A[n event in Colombia astonished mi$llions.
A 10-year old rap@ed by an e=lder brother gave birth to a h=ealth=y boy.
The baby was born via a C-section, b'ut both the gir@l a]nd her baby are doing w:el:l.
T/he/y h[ave been in medical care for some time.
It is yet some time before the young mother an+d he|r bab;y will be release+d home.
“ According to the information I h$ave received from t+he p/oli/ce, t{he minor became pre\gnan\t after she was sexually abused b~y a family member - her bro_t_her, ” the director of the hospita^l, where the baby was d}elivered, tol=d a foreign TV station.
The po$li$c$e are investigating t)he ca^s^e as a rape and child abuse.
A Norwegian armed battal^ion t;o;ok part in the NATO trainings i*n the most remote a]nd severe locations.
Soldier,s from the N*orwegian armed forces took part in a series of complicated t!raining!s in the mountains to th)e north o)f Osl=o, capital of the country.
I;t i's a part o+f the NA~T~O training exercise “ Trident Junc~tur~e 2018 ” - the biggest NATO training since the end of the Cold Wa]r.
After the September 11 terrorist att-acks, most o#f the soldiers of t#he second mi[lit[a[ry force ba;tt;alion of No,rw,a,y spent a lot of t!ime far a,wa,y from home, in such places as Afghanistan, i.#e . in warm climate.
But they are mostly skilled t!o fi!g!ht in Arctic conditions, an'd t*hese skills of th~eir~s are particularly useful now, when the NATO s=hifts its attention.
I#n the recent days, in th~e m[oun[tains to the east o'f Tyns^et, often in the most remot<e an:d severe locations, soldiers engaged in fake combats against real British soldiers.
Soldiers are skilled t.o survive in th-is cold i_n the wi)ld, but in the severe climate they have t(o carry muc$h bi[gg[er weights on their shoulders - one backpack weighs about 50 kg.
Soldiers staying i{n the command post say that they share their s@k@ill@s ho_w to survive and fig@ht in such conditions with ot&her NATO soldiers.
According to th;e soldiers, this training, which reminds of r[eal war actions m%ore than an~y other, will trai;n them to be r}eady if real threat occurs.
