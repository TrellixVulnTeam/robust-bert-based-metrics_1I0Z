Nowadays, young p^eopl^e never part with thei&r smartphones.
Young gi=rls and boys listening to music via headphones c(onnected to a mobile phone do not h!e!ar a c"a"r coming beh^ind their backs an~d sounding a horn.
T;here are even those who cross a r(o(ad a!t forbidden road sections an$d have an accident.
The tale[n[ted Dasta:n acknowledged t!he feature of fellow people who d.o not want to obey superiors.
T%he headphones invented by Dastan have a safety s(ignal i!n it.

Gorgeous celebration in a&ll the cities and residential areas of Kazakhstan of the 10`0th anni*versary o#f bloo!dthir!st!y red b&u&tche&rs of Leninist Komsomol is a shame fo@r our country, brothers.
Th$is, f`irs`t of all, means Komsomols' slap in th[e face of th:e Independence of the Kazakh Cou{ntry.
Yesterday the information about the g`rea`t celebration of the 10%0th anniversary of re*d butchers tryi|ng th,eir best b}y the initiators, heads of former Komsomo#l, followers initiated by today '\s red butchers Nurlan Omarov in Semey, the birthplace of "Al'ashorda" standing at the o}rigins o)f Kazakh statehood was released.
I was surprised to s)e)e pione@er@s wearing a re=d tie o)n the Internet in Kazakhstan schools.
Now having se>e>n these Russified, i.e . slaves with no origin started to poi+so+n ope"nly the c&onsc&iou&s of Kazak[h young generation I found nothing to s:ay...What a horr=o=r!
How can we understand this Kom*s*omol's backtrack from th_e Independence o?f Kazakh Co$untry, saying we are Russian sl(av(e(s?
O$h, horror, slave's name i%s a s"lave!
We nee#d to understand that r;ec;ognit;io;n by t;hose Tasmagambetov, Aitimova, Sultanov in fact t&hat they are colonizers' slave:s, open expression of their end+les+s love towards R+ussia is an ope~n recognition of the dependence of today's followers of yesterday red butchers fi[rst o~f al.l t<o Russia which we thought to be vanished into thin ai,r up to date.
In 1986, I still remember dishonest actions of those current "forever deputies": K.|Sult|anov, B.Aitimova during famous December events i=n 1986 d-ishe-d on D.Konayev who helped them raise in their car?ee?r?s to Gennady Kolbin, grieving and cry{ing, n$ow they told about tho-se participat`ing in December events: "C*omra*de Kolbin, I will b*ri*ng those bitches y|o|u to punish them ';', and I was th]e on]e to write about this gri@ef in my epos "Zob?alan" (Outrages), du%r%ing the Sovie"t Empire, in particular, i-n 1990, made one-ho~ur long r<adio play in Munich, and I a`m the author of the famous w$r$iting traveling the wor_ld, akyn Zhu(m(ash Kokbori!
T%he Kazakh nation also did no/t forget who inv~ol~untarily quietened down at that time!
As th,e citizen of Ind%ep%en%dent Kazakhstan, as the child of the Kazakh nation, I w[ill a_ccus_e openly the foll{owers of those red butc*he*r*s!
I+f our country is independent indeed, I will openly talk tha?t the day born to punish them as th:e state betrayers constituting a threat open+l+y t`o the Inde:pen:den:ce of Kazakhstan of forever president o^f this co=unt=ry as the wh@ole people!
"My nation, my Kazakh, m}y poor pe@o@ple" (Abay), it is t[he m:omen:t t%o op`enly punish these red butcher Komsomol as the whol=e nation.
Wake up, Kazakhs, h%i%story wi)l)l n]ev]er forgive your next quiescency.
Never fo,rget t{his, Kazakhs!

I have familiari(zed myself with the l=etter.
I hav_e seen it.
In ge(n(eral, I am against i`t.
Because Kostanay region has it}s o]wn name from history.
If I am not mistaken, 1\7 people signed th;i;s l|et|ter.
I kno]w a f,ew people.
When I talked t=o them in person, Sabyrzhan Akhmetuly who was akim in m{any distric{t{s ref`us`ed it s.aying "I have not signed th<is letter".
Kalibek Deripsaldin (co$m$pos$er) said that he also h%ad not sig<ned this letter.

So, w/e w[i[ll see.
But, in gen"e"ra"l, there is m>y viewpoint.
We have the center of the district for[med with Torgay nam/e, coming fr*om long sin'ce.
If i:n 3$0s, 40s the name of K[osta[nay city was Torgay, then the works on re<turni<n<g the pre_v_ious name would be reasonable.
But I a,m again@s@t it, it i<s my viewpoint - Arkhimed Mukhambetov concluded.

`_` B/lack archaeology" fighting rules agreed.
Monuments a>re left open and a=re getting destroyed after `_` black archaeologists".
Ministe[r of Culture and S{por{ts Arystanbek Mu[khamed[iuly stated this during presenting a b]ill "On protecting and using histo_r_ic_al-cultural legacy objects" in Mazhilis.
Regulation o\f archaeological, restoration works carried ou"t on historical-cultural legacy obj-ects requires reconsidering.
It's not a sec'r'et that o}ur un~ique monuments or not yet researched objects are being subjected to searchin[g a"nd digging works, mainly, by `%` black arch;aeolo;gists". Monuments are le~ft open and are getting partially or fully destroyed after th]em.
Besides, there are also situations where construction job)s being carried out intensively in areas neigh~boring historical-cultural l<e<ga<cy objects significantly affe=ct historical who&l&ene&ss and preservation o!f historical and cultural monu;ments a+nd result in negative consequences.
In whole, it '_s no doubt, tha(t it's necessary to strengthen obligations which r%equire act!ual regul:at:ion in legal area and creation o"f convenien?t terms for protection and usage of hi(storical-cultural legacy objects, - said the Mini-s-te-r.
According to hi:m, in thi]s regard finding and registering historical-cultural legacy objects, also sett}ing an order of monitoring their state, preserving historical-cultural legacy obj%ect%s i/n final historical form and introduction of quality new mechan-i-sm-s of usage o+n legislation level i|s co[nsidered.
In addition, carrying out archaeological works and fighting "b<lack archaeology" rules a,n,d terms set, defining leg_al regime of using la@nd plots in protected regions, legal regime o&f regulating the constructio;n of historical a_nd cultural mon$u$men$t$s, using na\tural l@andscape regions is suggested.
International experience has be&e&n analyzed and considered during the bi]ll preparation pr-o-ce-s-s.
For example, fighting `/` black archaeology" meas,ure are int{r{oduce{d i[n R<ussi<an legisla-t-ion carrying out ill)egal archaeological researches, stealing archaeological things, evasion from transferring artifacts to the country and other things.
I(n other word"s, criminal liability is considered.
In Italy, there are ob>l>i>gations in t`erms o@f legislation for private collectors.
According to them, making a list of cul#ture and art obj}ects o,f hist(or(ica(l and aesthetical interest which are in private ownership a~nd its periodical update i^s considered.
Besides, notwithstanding et]hnicit]y, citi)z)enship of the mentioned objects owner;s, their objects are subject to state prot`ec`t`ion, - sai]d A. Mukhamediuly.
