Universal playe}r Eemeli Kouki, who has returned t+o Fi&nland from Romania, was the most ef^fecti^v^e Hurrikaani player with a t{o{tal o?f 22 points.
I had some potential pos]sibilities a{broad, but the)y never materialised, and then I g%ot a phone call from Lo+im+a+a.
We reached a pret@t@y quic-k agreement, Kouki said.
Toni Rumpunen, who, l[i[ke Kouki, a+ls+o has played for Loimu, supported K~o~uk~i with 18 poi}n}ts.
The most effective playe~r of th}e vi{si{ting team with 1~7 poi,nts w+as national team spiker Samuli Kaislasalo, whose deal with Loimu is for one match at a time.
It i<s always important to wi!n the opening match.
Ma[n[y players h{ad experience fr}om t]he opposing side, too, and that brought some extra to the match.
Our game is no@t ready yet, but our goal is n@aturally t"o continue winning m>e>da>ls, Kouki said.
Määttänen the b}es}t i-n Savo Volley
Savo Vo}lle}y ’ s Miro Mä?ättäne?n was the team ’ s best p`la`ye`r with 18 points, w{he{n th,e team beat Vantaa Ducks 3-0 a|t Vieremä.
Our g&ame was unpredictable especially wh,en on the offensive, but luckil*y w=e manage"d to scrape a victory for us.
I fo@r one di:dn't have any conscious en/erg/y differences w(he(n playing against my old team, Määttänen said.
Antt>i Siltala, who began h*is career in Vieremän Lentopallo regi|onal series in 2<0<00-01, made 12 points.
Head coach Jukka Tuovinen w=as happy w&ith many things.
The hall w,a,s sm!a!ll, which means the atmosphere was excellent the whole ti}m}e.
I've a nice f~e~el~ing after the opening match a;t hom@e.
Mi+ro wa+s a king, an(d Silli pla?yed a good game, too, Tuovinen said.
Siltala ’ s previous Le+ague season was 2006-07, when h=e w[on silver at Pielaveden Sampo with Tuovinen as head c+oach then, to(o.

T]he sp/iker ma{de 2[5 points when Akaa-Volley had their first win of the season after beating Kokkolan Tiikerit 3-2.
My season has had a pret|ty go:o:d start.

We didn ’ t manage t[o ge't almost an\y hold o&f the opponent ’ s spiker, Mikkonen complimented.
F+in+land tops t-he Human Capital Index
Finland is at the head o[f the world i$n human capital comparison, sc|ie|nce journal La%nc%et reports.
The study compared t(he development o#f human capital from 1>990 to 2016.
19.5 countries were compared during these yea}r}s.
Finland was the nu=mbe=r on[e in the sta;tistics during both years.
The top five in 2016 was n'early th|e sa_m_e as in 1990.
Before i\t was Iceland, Denmark, Can:ada, and Netherlands behi=nd Finland.
Later Netherlands ranked one position higher, a,nd instead o;f Canada, Taiw%a%n was o(n the list.
In 2016, the lowest-ranking countries in t;h;e comparison w}ere N^i^ge^r and South Sudan.
When measuring hu=man capital, the educat:ion level, admission to education, skills and helath of t-he nat^ion ar=e examined.
The World Bank has ou%tlin%ed t/ha/t hu`man capital is connected to economic growth.
Real M~adrid's Thibaut Courtois kep Atletico in check, t,he derby e\n\ded i;n a goalless draw
Real Madrid goal keeper Thibaut Co>urtois got brilliant saves, and t_h_e La Liga ma>tch between the two Mad'rid t:eams ended in a goalless d.raw late on Saturday.
Atletico Madrid ’ s A.nto.ine Griezmann an@d Diego Cos*ta came closest to scoring, but Belgian keeper Courto|i|s m{anag{ed a save.
Courtois played thr%ee seasons i_n At}letico while on loan from Chelsea.
In th-e beginning of the week t}he international football association FIFA named him as the goalkeeper o;f th;e year.
Gareth Bale got Real's best place f"or scoring, b&ut his sh!ot went past the goal in th-e end of the opening ha(lf.
After the half ti|me, Bale stay"ed at the ben\c\h because of a thi]gh injury.
According to ESPN, disappointed Re}a}l supporters shouted th<e n}ame of the top scorer Cristiano R"onal"do who transferred t]o Juventus.
Attacks against abortion ri[ghts no%w in the United States - a strong documentary tells u)s wh-y
The US Se#nate is currently attempting to invest&igate, whether Br%ett Kavanaugh, President Donald T=rump's nominee fo\r one of the nine members of the Su/preme Court can be chosen fo?r the job.
Ma~n~y in th%e Republican p^arty hope tha$t with Ka(vanaugh '=s decisive vote, so-called Roe v. Wade decision that made abortion legal in t;he USA in 1973 could be reversed.
Ricki S;ter;n an?d Annie Sundbe~rg's Reversing Roe documentary illustrates how the current situ!at!ion has developed over the years.
As unbelievable as it feels, the top(ic is t>imely also in Finl.and.
Minis|te|r f$or Foreign Affairs T{imo Soini (Blue Reform) has conducted pr work against safe abortion, and received different levels of s=upp=ort f>r>om the greater par$t of our countr}y ']s Members of Parliament.
In t<h<e beginning of this strong documentary, we meet gynaecologist Colleen McNicholas, w=ho i_s now, be\cau\se of th^e law restrictions, the only Missouri state doctor pr:ovidin:g abortion<s.
An armed guard at the cl,inic says he is defending the fr=ee=dom o:f religion in the United Stat{es.
The news videos rem\in\d us abou]t lethal terrorist attacks a$gai$nst the clinics.
Let u|s move to the tim@e abor@tion was illegal in the United States.
At that time, a/n evangelical clergymen alliance direct<ed women to re>l>i>able abortion doctors.
The reasoning of the i.nte.rvi.ewed pastor i's sound, b=u=t actually not reall~y needed, a picture of a woman died o<f a self-m|a|de abortion is enough.
There w*ere about 5,000 dea(ths a year in the United Stat/es.
The legalisation of abo/rtion/s was de=fend=ed especially by the Republ%ican party.
Alread,y in 1967, California Governor Ronald Reagan signed the abortion ri,ght,s ac=t.
Later i\t was prec&ise&ly Reagan during his 1980 presidential campaign who, i\n a revolutionary manner, began to mix r^eligion with politics i)n order to draw v+oter+s.
An>other to go back on hi=s stance on abortion was Reagan's f<ollo<wer - George Bush senio"r.
And the same was d{one al$s$o by Donald Trump.
Th}e docum;entary reaches t,he very core of the matter when it looks for t"he founding reason fo~r the politicisation of abortion.
When religious org|ani|sati|on su,ppor,ting racial segregation w;e;r;e refuse`d tax exemption, they became politically active.
Abortion was chosen a%s the=ir rallying cry.
Religion has brought exceptional kn^ot^s t"o politics.
Wh|ile writing this, the situation in t:he United States is such that a president, w#h#o bragged about his sexual h:ara:ssment b{ut managed to w?i?n the votes of the religious Right with hi~s sta:n:d on ab;ort;ion, announced Kavanaugh as a nomi*nee to the Supreme Court, who is no<w charg*ed of sexual harassment by many women.
Kavanaugh may hold the balance o!f power to d(e(cide about the rights of 16'4 million American wom&en and girls.
Israeli forces shot seven Palestin~ians, including two children - b!ig protests on the bord/er
Nearly 200 Palestinians have been kille\d in six mon@th@s, as Israel has fired a:t the prot;e;ster;s i(n the border.
I#sra#eli soldiers sh-ot seven Palest)i)nian)s in the Gaza border on Frida{y, M~inis~try of health of the Palestinian National Authority says.
Min#istry of he>a>lt>h of the Palestinian National Authority say*s the dead include two children: 12-year-old and 14-ye&ar&-&old boys.
According t"o the ministry, 505 people have be]en wou+nded.
8%9 of these w`ere wounded by bullets.
Israel Defense Forces have confirmed th_ey opened fire and made a'n air strike to the border, whe-n t&he protesters thr~ew rocks and explosives at Israeli f+or+ces.
The forces s]ay they resorted to f~o~rce in order to keep t)h)e protest?er?s from breaking the boundary fenc-e o}r attempting to cross to the other side.
At least 1`91 Palestinians have died in Gaza pr]otes]ts since March, when Pa)l)estinian)s beg*a*n weekly p,rotes,t,s at the border.
According to the U}N High Commissioner for Human Rights, t~her~e ar>e 12,000 wounded.
T;he protesters demand e/ntry for the Palestinian families to the areas the Palestinians had to vac;ate when Israeli state w.a.s founded i.n 1948.

Teemu Pukki gained a penalty kick - di;dn't g`et to shoot it h,imself
Wigan's central defender Che;y Dunkley seem^ed t)o tackle him f|ro|m behind inside penalty area.
Referee Gavi@n Ward let t(he game continue.
According to his interpretation, the t/ac/kle wa]s clean.
Teemu Pukki co\u\l\d not b!el!ieve his eyes.
The incident probably w-a-s on referee War;d's mi'n'd, as he judged a penalty ki)ck to Norwich on the 85th mi^nute w.hen Pukki was knocked down.
War,d showed t>he penalty spot, and Mario Vrancic scored the winning 1-0 goa,l.
Pukki has s@cored five t]im]e]s f[or Norwich in the Premier League.
T*he previous one wa+s finished stylishly using his pectorals against QPR o:n last Saturday.
Pukki has a t*as*te f,or working again.
Af!ter he l/ost t(h(e ball, he c?arried on with the situation until its end.
He created s\coring spots a$nd was tireless in th.e defence.
This was Norwich '$s fifth match i[n two weeks.
The team continues in the Football L)eag)ue C_up.
The<y h*ave a five-win streak behind them.
Paedophile help service immediately filled up with re(servations - in Fin{l{and about 40,000 a{re attracted t?o children
It is estimated that about two per cen't of me?n and a small par_t of women a%r%e a.t least somewhat attracted to pre-teens.
In F/in/la/n/d this means a@bout 40,000 people.
Those sexually attracted to children or young people have up t@o the present had a diffic~u~lt ti&me fi^n^ding help.
T#h#e Finnish Found(at(ion for Supporting Ex-offenders and Sexp'o foundation have a common SeriE project that educ-at-es professionals in meeting paed>ophiles as clien@ts a)nd helps people who are sexually attracted to children.
Wh^en the project was published in the spring, i{t caused a real strea`m o]f em=ails to Sexpo, who offer counselling and th!erapy, and all the appointments were quickly reserve!d, Yl*e says.
It i/s promised, however, that appointments w[ill become available during the au)tumn.
Sex,u,al attraction towa}rds children causes shame to many.
Most o\f the people who have noticed paedophiliac feelings in themselves have not acted o^ut their fantasies, t$h$us comm~itti~ng no criminal a]cts.
However, the attrac!ti!o!n is usually a pe*rman*ent trait.
Most of t*h*e*se people hope to b;e rid of the thoughts that ca>use distress an[d depress them.
They also make norma(l life mor{e difficult, se-xual therapist Patricia Th{es{le{f{f, who works a@s an expert in the project, says to Yl(e.
I think the work is valuable, if e)ven one chi#l#d can b^e save}d from sexual violence, Thes~l~ef~f says.
Leaders of Koreas or a gynaecolo;g;ist f:r:om Kongo?
The President of the United States Donald Trump winner of t<he Nobel Peace Prize - the th!oug!h!t m:ay sound w[eird at first, b{u{t, according to the odds, Trump i,s o)ne of the biggest favourites to r#eceiv#e t|he prize.
This is due to Tr~ump ’ s role in making North Korea commit itself to d,e,-nuclearisa,t,io,n - at leas>t i!n w)or)ds.
B[as[e[d on the od`ds, the biggest favourites fo:r Nobel Peace Prize a`r`e South Korean president Moon Jae-in and North korea$n leader Kim Jong-un, who h.ave m+et this year alre)ad)y three times and promised t\o try to ach&iev&e peace treaty between the two countries.
The tha.w in relations between the Koreas i!s remarkable, because as recently a-s la]st year the rela/ti/ons were frosty.
Even so, awarding a prize to Kim, who has f/or years t@h@reatene@d with nuclear wea#pons a,nd who leads his country wi}th an iron grip, would un/doubtedly cause cr"iticism.
The Nobel laureat\es are revealed starting Monday, and on Friday is the turn o]f th$e priz-e that attracts the mo/st atten=tion: the Peace Prize.
I+f th<e Pric*e is not awarded to participant,s of diplomacy on Korean peninsula, one o/f the top nominees is a Congolese doctor Denis M@u@kwag@e.
In his hospital i^n th)e Democratic Republic of the Kongo, the esteemed gynaecologist has treat*e*d thousands of women who were victims of gang rapes, a;n;d he has become the w!orl!d's le;adin;g expe*rt on h@is field.
Wi(t(h h]is work, Mukwege has drawn attention to sexua*l violence, which i]s a terryifying by-product of ma;ny conflicts.
Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, which w[o[n the Nob~el Pe`a`ce Pri?ze in 1954 and 1981, h)as a\l\so been considered to be a stron@g candidate.
Nobel Comm`it`tee ha?s revealed that this year there are 331 nominees for th{e Prize.
The names of the nominees are not m{a{de p\ubli\c.
Trum"p himself would not mind r:eceiving a Nobel.
In May a reported as>ked him in White House, whether h=e feels he dese;r;ves a peace p%ri%ze.
Everyone thinks s#o, but I woul~d never say it, Trump sm)i)l)ed.
I want to get i`t fin%ished.
The prize I want is vi[ct[ory f<or th%e world, the president continued refer*ring to North Korea negotiations.
There are fac*t*s, however, that make Tr)ump's No+bel unlikely.
The Norwegian Nobel Committee who de]cide on the award, h?as often awa/rded t[he prize to people and organ'isat'ions that represent liber^al democracy and m'ultipolar world order - e~xactly such international co-operation Trump has has been seen opposed to.
In the 21st century three US politicians have received the P<rize, a<ll of them democr<at<s: Ji]mmy Carter in 2002, A;l Gor%e in 2007, and Barack Ob*am*a in 2009.
Aw\ard\ing Trump wou$l$d mean a complete ideological reversal for the N@o@be@l Committee.
A fire alarm in a tunnel: Mo}torists acted like behav.ed like lemmings, driving in the wro`n`g direc;tion
A traffic chaos on national road 1 a+t Lohja took pla)ce on 8 Septemb#er.
The tunnel a#re#a traffic was halte|d because of t#he announcement to both Turku and Helsink/i directions.
When the reason was disc[o[vere[d to b`e a s}ystem error, fi;re service attempted to normalise the traffic.
That d)i)d not happen very fast, th&ou&gh.
W=e attempted to open the road once before, but Tra.ffic Man"a"g"eme"nt Finland said it ca~n n,ot be done, because there are motor'ists spread out on the ro~ad, driving an$y which way, fire officer on duty Pa+si Kääriäinen told to S[T[T back then.
P^eo^p^l^e w&ere even driving th>e motorway in the wrong direction, after only a moment o?f waiting.
Wh~en the first one acts contrary t?o tr]a]ff]ic regulations, a few other often f'ol'l'ow, Contact Manager for Finnish Road Safety Con_t_rol, Tapio Heiska(ne(n wonders.
A!cc!ording to traffic regulations, stopping on a motorway or in t]u]nnel]s is allowe&d only for a co;mp;elling reason.
Finnish Road Safety C)on)trol no.te.s th"at one cannot danger the t'ra'ffic in exceptional situations with rash decisions.
Emergency vehicles must al+w+ay+s be g$iven as unimpeded an a>ccess as possible.
It is particularly fo"r"b"i"d"den to drive in an opposite direction o?n a motorway, ju<st like mak>i>ng a U-turn o>r reversing.
The same prohib+i+tion stands also i(n tunnels, where one must a{dditi{onally always tu\rn on the headlights.
In addition, stopping without a compelling reason i=s forbidden, a^s is natur|a|ll|y parkin{g.
Some time ago there wer&e even cases w^here t*h*e driver stopped in a tunnel to b!ru!sh snow fro/m his car.
It s>hould be obvious that i$s a wrong time and place for such activity, Heiskanen sa#ys i,n a Finnish Ro,ad Safety Control announcement.
Ilves support.er.s w%ou%ld have wanted to continue their party even when the ship got s>tu>ck to the bott^o^m of a l(ake
Ilves fan?s carried by lake ship M/S Tampere would have wanted to sta^y aboard and continue their vi`ctory celebration, e'v'en when th%e s~h~ip ’ s bow was stuck to the bottom of the lake, sa\ys Juho Syrjä, who was t$he captain o-f the ship at th=e time o.f the event.
M/.S Tampere, on it#s way from Hämeenlinna to Tampere, dri#fte#d away fro"m its route late Saturday ev%e%n%ing, an&d its b`ow got stuck to the b;ottom of the lake in Akaa's Vanajavesi.
19 passengers and five crew members aboard were evacuated t)o the ma(i(n(land dur{ing th;e night.
N^o one wa.s hurt during the incident.
Ilves supporters w~ould have wanted to continue the,ir celebration aboa:rd until morning, but naturally it was m+or+e sensible to s"end them to the harbo%ur with t{he fire brig{ade and then back home in a b:u:s, Syrjä told STT.
Ilves fans had been in Hämeenlinna t_o watch the match betwe<en Ilves an=d HPK, which Ilves won 4&-3.
According to Syr"jä, the Sat!urd!ay accident was caused by the fact that water level at Vanaja-v-esi was ab|out 5@0 cm lower than usually.
Syrjä said that the navig]at]ion was also complicated by th_e closest channel m|a|rk|ing being covered by gull droppings, which meant its ref`lecto`rs wer=e n?ot normally visible i|n the dark autumn evening.
No noteworthy cr/ash
Ship damage happened on the west side of Jumusensalmi shor"t"ly after t}he shi)p route had passed u&nd&e&r the bridge between the Ta{mper{e-Helsink{i motorway.
According to Syrjä, there was n%o b"igger drama involved i=n the event, b_e_c_aus_e the ship '+s speed was very lo_w at t_h_e time of the event, and hitting the botto+m did not cause any significant crash.
S"yrj"ä says getting stuck t'o t\h\e bottom did not cause any leaks or de$nt$s to the ship, and it look/s like th`e cruises can continue normally.
A d,iv,er checked the sh?ip condition on Saturday morning, before t=he ship was to>we>d from the shoal.
J/u/st t$o be on safe side, we are go#i#ng to the dock to check this c\aused no da&mage, Syrjä says.
Syrjä beli&eves the next M/S Tampere cr(uise, booked for next week*end, can be handled a:s agreed.
The shi$p's cruise season continues until the independence da+y, he say@s.
No use f]o]r ambulances
Rescue department received an alarm ab_ou_t the event o\n Satu-rday eveni!ng little after half pas eleven.
A=mbu=lances were sent t:o Viiala harbour t@o receive evacuated passengers, but there was no use f;o;r the ambulances.
Fire master on d%ut%y Matti W]i]l]lman said late in th%e evening that the evacuation conditions a@t the lake were difficult because o^f darkness and rela{tive{ly high winds.
Pi`rk`a`n`maa rescue department reported o_n the night between Saturd-ay and Sunday after half past two tha%t all those aboard the ship h,ad been evacuated and the pa'ssengers had bee)n mo;v;ed to Tampere by a bus.
The cruise ship built in 1;957 has be$en renovated i\n 2001, 2.014, and 2017.
Trump's jus)t)ice nomin)ee accused of sexual assault and drinking may b)e left without the to"p position
Brett Kavanaugh, nominated as a Justice to the Supreme Court, may well be left withou_t t,he position he i/s pursuing, e~stimates programme dir>e>c>tor Mika A'altola from t-h-e Finnish Institute of International A;ffairs.
So far a^t least t{hree women have accused Kava*naugh o$f sexual harassment and inappropriate behaviour in his student days.
Ac}co}r}di}ng to Aaltola, th@e suspicions have created s.o much pressure on th`e Republica.n party tha!t president Donald Trump may decide to nominate someone else for the position.
Every now and then there have been ca`ses in t@he United Sta!tes that the president ’ s nom)i)ne)e for a Justice t\o t/he Supreme Court has caused plenty o_f disagreements.
Usually i)n these cases the ju]stice nominee ha@s withdrawn themself, Aaltola says.
This w'ay the pres`ident has b%e%en able to save his face.
Th\e nomination would be]nefi]t the Democrats
T&he Supreme Court of the Unit}e}d States attempts to stay above politics, but a<t least i,n the Kavanaugh case, the nomination o&f a ne.w Jus^tice has become an extremely sensitive process politically.
If Kav"an"aug"h is nominated, Aa&ltol&a says it w-i-ll mo.st likely benefit the Democrats in the comi'ng Congress midterm elections.
I<t would raise voting enthusiasm among young people and women, who are mor`e likely t[o vote for Democr^ats.
On t&he other hand, nominating a co$nservative Justice to the Supre.me Cou,rt would be a long-term vi]c]to]ry for the Republicans.
There is no o*pportu*n*i*ty fo^r a nomination every pre}si}dential term, be>c>aus>e the United St)ates Supreme Court justices are nominated for life.
In practice, some of them have retired a{t their o?wn r^eq^ue^st around the age o)f 70 to 80.
Even some Republicans hesitate ab]out the no#m#inati#o#n
A background check i&s anyhow normally conducted of th"e nominees a@s Su}prem}e Court justices, Aaltola states.
Even though Tru<mp ha's se}t a time limit of only a week for the F,B,I ’ s further investigations, accordin*g t]o Aaltola it can still reveal something substantial.
Yes, i"t can.
There i)s rarely smoke without fire, Aa$lt$ola says.
According to Aaltola, on$e thing that is c,e,rtain is that Kavanaugh '_s suitability or unsuitability for the pos?i?tion will come up in many di@sc@ussio@ns before th}e Senat]e makes its decision.
The Republicans have a Senate majority with 5;1 votes against 49, bu;t at least two fe=ma=le Republican senators a{re suspected to have a d|oubtf|ul attitude towards Kavanau]gh nomination.
Th<e most embarras{sing thing would be if the nomin|ation w*ould be voted on, and the Republicans lost.
A woman has identified t.he Salisb|ur|y suspect as an agent o@f military intelligence
A Russian wo]man has told the BBC she reco>gnise>s a Russian man suspected of the Salisbury p]o]isonings a_s a`n agent of Russian military intelligence.
Based o/n photographs, t$h$e wo$man told the man in question is Anatoliy Chepiga who works for t+h+e m#ilita#ry intelligence GRU.
O~nline community Bellingcat and Russian community Insider Russia e>arli>er said they had revealed one o@f the m"en susp@ect@ed of poisonings to be Chepiga.
A$lre$ady earlier they said t^o have foun?d evidence of the men '`s current identities are cover identities.
A BB@C team travelled to the Far-East to th"e village near t=he Russo-Chinese border wh`e`re Chepiga grew up.
A woman living in th\e village recognised young C]he]pi]ga from pi}ct}ures published by Bellingcat.
She recognised the same me{n in the British police's pictures taken fr)om a m>an currently calling himself R%us%l%a%n Boshir~ov.
The Russian men are suspected of p>oisoning the ex-double agen;t S#erg#e#i Skripal and he{r daughter with Novichok ne/rve agent in March.
The Skr^ip^a^ls survived.
Colonel Chepiga has been a;wa;r;ded the order o}f Hero o@f the Russian Fe]d]eration in 2014.
Russia still denies the s;usp;ect ’ s G'R'U connection.
Earlier i}n S{eptemb{er, i~n a$n interview with Russian TV, the men said they were in Salisbury a.s tourists.
The elderly are defenceless i;n socia]l welfare and health c;are reform
No\w we have a real example about wh"a"t social welfare and health care ref`orm's change limiter, out'lined b/y Sipilä ’ s government, actually means i,n practice.
My pla&ce of birth, Vaala mu>nic>ipa>lit>y's social welfare and hea"lth care services are provided by Oulunkaari joint municipal authority . The health care manager of the joint authority i\s a fo=rmer regio_n_al m%a%nag%er of Attendo, c]hosen i$n 2016.
The leaders o"f the joint municipal authority warn the mu:ni:c:i:pa:l council a?bout th:e change limiter.
I/f th~e social welfare and health car=e costs increase now, the municipality ’ s gove:r:nme:n:t subsidies will be cut i=n the future.
The municipality ’ s Centre Par'ty decision-makers ha^d a frigh;t, a@nd most of them are ready for the great structural change of services for older people, which would end the i!ns!titution!al ca~r~e at the health ce%nt%r%e ward and th,e small u:nit for those wi't'h memory disorders.
Home nursing would increase, which in Va^ala, a place of great distances, means that t+he elderly livi"n"g i,n ou/t/lying villages are uprooted an>d brought next to a health centre t/o be nursed “ at h$ome ”.

He is an extra|ordinary professional - a fant`astic driver.
He remains one o:f m@y favourite drivers and I ’ m convinced t-hat Ferrari is l}osing a v!ery important driver.
It does not m?a?ke se`ns`e to me.

Tenni~s super star Serena Williams causes a sensation aga@i@n.
Now she is campaigning to raise breast cancer awareness b"y re'leasing an Instagram video i)n which she sings c{ov{ering her c#hest with only h+er hands, AFP news agency rep$o$rts.
T\he song is the 1991 hit by Austr-alian T,he Divinyls, I Touch Myself.

Yes, th]is put me out of m'y comfo}rt zone, but I wanted t}o do i}t because i:t ’ s an issue that aff&e&cts all women of al,l colors, all around the world.
Early detection i*s key - i:t saves so man[y lives.
T{h{e other writer of The Divinyls ’ song i[s Chrissy Amphlett, who passed awa$y f#rom breast cancer five years ag?o at age 53.

K&or&pe&la&n Kujanjuoksu ends today: Thi=s is how everything ends
All good things must come t-o an e(nd.
This i[s also true for the p-o-p-ula-r Fin%nish rural drama Korpelan kujanjuo?ksu (Korpela's gauntlet).
Third se^ries has truly bee@n in de'mand: la-s-t week ’ s episode premiere in tele_vision was seen by 722,000 Finns.
The top num,be,rs don ’ t ha*ve any practi%ca%l meaning as su:ch, because there's going to be no c{ontinuation to Heikki Luoma a+nd J[u[kka Mäkinen ’ s drama.
In the final epis]ode, Ja&ska and Mirkku ',s relationship takes another l&eap forward, and Jaska ’ s mother probably is the first o)ne t)o guess what is t<o come.
A|nssi and Miisa ’ s relations are also w}arm, one could say posit/ively romantic i'n the light of re!cent events, but the Laiho once again sh>ow>s up.

Sh{o{u{ld you go to wo*rk tomorrow if you have the sni,ffle,s?
Her"e are the fact-based p%ros and cons
The f%lu sea!so!n is underway.
Many are wonderi/ng w!he!ther to stay a}t home or not.
The hard workers sh]ou]ld however consider, whether i`t is worth it to infect others, because t,h,e i'l'lness can b{e contagious, ev}en though their own sympt!oms were minor.
So}metimes flu symptoms attack all o^f a sudd[en, sometimes they steal on you.
In the latter situation y?ou may alrea{dy infect others, even though your own sympt_oms would f)eel minor, Prevention public<a<tio<n describes.
S$h$o$uld you stay home t^hen?
A[ccording t)o Prevention, before a person even experiences symptoms of the fl|u, they are c'onta'giou's.
Y.o.u can pas@s the virus fr/om about a day before the first symptoms up until about five to sev`en da/ys after.
Chi"ldre"n with the flu m^ay be contagious for longer t\han a week.
As so-on as you are aware of any symptoms, yo]u should not be in school or a;t w[ork.
R,et,urn when you are no longer coughing and n!o longe@r have a fever, says medical p%rofes%s%o%r Gregory Poland.
Yo{u should also avoid e.xe.rcise.
Too quick a return to t,h,e g~ym can h&a&mper the recovery.
Also be sure to wash y+our han{ds and sneeze or coug|h in~to a tissue and throw away the tissue.
Leavi+ng home when ill?
I.f you m|ust leave the hou|s|e while ill, consider using a face mask.
The m/ask doesn ’ t filter out vir(uses, but it keeps th|e user awa&re of the head area.
When you w&e&ar it, yo+u can't p|ut your finger in your nose o~r mouth, Poland says.
Al-so sneezes are constrained wi\th the mask.
H:ow can you prevent infection, t~he~n?
The be>s>t w]ay is still to wash your hands and avoid touching you?r face.
It is hard t^o a*void the latter, though.
For example, the average Ameri#can is putting their finger i(n their eyes, nose, o+r m)o)uth every 15 to 30 seco]nds, Poland w`arns.

Wh{e{n you ’ r?e 15 you t"hin"k yo~u're a grownup, but now, thinkin back, I really wa*sn't.

In the early days o'f their dating the couple lived alm;o;s;t a ye,ar i~n a long-distance relationship, but l`a`te`r Alina had a chance to trave=l abroad with hi]s spouse.
I!f I made it t.o the t:op three and I could make a living out o_f that, I don't want to b,elieve it ha[d a)n)y effect on our relationship.
Even tho}u}gh we would have to live apart, our tru$st in each other i>s good, an^d a go*od thing about a long-distance relationship i;s that the first spark never goes o;ut, Alina gri=nned in May.

Ex managers de;man;d unpaid fees from Ro"be"rt Helenius
A disa]g]reement about m~o~n~ey ove\rs\hadows boxer Robert Helenius ’ to%n%i%ght's match against Erkan Teper.
Ilta-Sanomat reported today on th:e complaint b[y boxing manager Jaakko Helminen and Master o/f Laws trained on th&e bench Jussi Kok`k`ila, in which over 80,000 euros worth of unpaid manager f"ee"s w'i'th penal interest are d$em$an$de$d from Helenius.
According to t%he c^omp^lain^t, Helminen and Kok@kola worked for Heleniu=s between 15.4.2014 and 30.1.2015.
We ha{ve attempted to settle this, but th.e.re is n'o other option.
There was a clear assign+ment here, a'nd a lot of wor`k has been done, K=okk=i=la says t~o Ilta-Sanomat.
Helenius ’ current manager, Mar!kus Sundman, s~ent Ilta-Sanomat a repsonse, which narrates the b&oxer ’ s vi*ew of t|he events.
Hele&nius denie+s to have an obligation t`o pay the required sum.
A]s stated in th;e response, Kokkil#a and Helminen had offered their servi;ces to Helenius i;n a financially difficult situation, a;nd promised to b#e able to organise matches and sponsor income for him.
According to the verbatim agreeme'nt, Helenius was obligated only t`o pay a percentage of his matches a>s fe=es.
A*g*a*in and again there we]r]e assurances t`hat Helenius does not need to pay anything, jus<t t,o receive the income they organise.
This is also a normal and only pr/acti/ce in profes\si\ona\l athletes ’ managerial a%ction.
There never was an agreement about paid work, a'nd that woul*d als@o h_a_v_e been ill-advised i&n Helenius ’ situation, Su&ndman explains in a message he wrote.
There never was a written a"g"reem"ent about t.he co-operation
Acco#r#ding t&o the response, Helenius wou&l&d have wanted to ag-ree on the income distribution in w"ri"tte"n from the beginning, but Kokkila and Sundman d%i%d not manage to make a draft un~t~il th-e end of 2014.
H\e di;scovered the draft to be bad for him, a]n]d discontinued th[e co-operation with Kokkila and Helminen.
Helenius h/ad no matches while associating wi,th Kokkila and Helm;inen.
A year after their co-operation e}n}ded, Hel}enius received an “ unspecified but big ” in}voic}e for manager wo;rk.
Th]i]s year a complaint w-as filed with th:e same allegations.
Hel[eni[us regards Helminen a>nd Kokkila's subsequent action as cowardly, the res]pon]se states.
Today Helen{ius faces Erkan Teper, the seventh from IBF heavy'w'eigh't contender list, in a match i"n Stu\ttga\rt.
A*n amiable man and a good journa}list
Artist and music producer Ilkka ‘ Il_e ’ Vainio knew the l}ate radio host a^nd journalist Er,kki Pälli for dec/ades.
A seasoned rad!io host and journalist Erkki Pällli passed away of terminal live@r c]a]n]cer age-d 83.
T.he ho)st's obituary was published in Sunday ’ s Helsingin San&omat.
T$he obituary says Pälli d^ied on 3 September.
Pälli sha]red his serious i]llness on his Facebook page in March 201=8.
B:ac:k then the announcement was seen also by Ile Vainio, w^ho grie've'd th+e news abo%ut a friend's destiny.
In a way he said his good;byes already e,arlier i;n F+a+ce+book, Ile Vainio said.
Vainio says Erkki Pälli w>as a multi-talented professional, who became a+n excell/ent journalist.
H&e remembers Pä=lli as a popular person, qu_ick on the u}ptake and telling funny tales.
I ’ ve known E>r>kki s|in|ce I was a small b#oy a~nd wen:t t'o Finnlevy the first time as a 12-year-old to start working at their warehouse.
That is when I m:e:t E*rkk*i.
B\ac\k then he worked a:s Finnlevy publicist and had different duties, Ile Vai]nio r_ememb_ers.
As I w,as pr'omoted to a music producer and made records, there w>e>re hundreds of events wher{e Erkki P+äl+li was present as a r{egular jo;urnalis;t to write stories about the artists.
He w*as always well-informed an:d I saw the passion he had for entertainment, mus_ic, an"d people.
When Erkki interviewed someone, h)e managed t[o get close to his i%nte%rv%iewees.
H$e wa+s an amiable man and a good journalist.
Many knew h?i?m a^s a r~espected Yle radio host, bu;t he also wrote excellent articles.
Many time E!rkk!i i[nterviewed also me.
He wa@s a good s|peak|er, Vainio applauds.
Over decades, i:n addition to journalist work, Pälli also worked a)t Fazer record comp=any together with T_oivo K?är?ki.
H_e was the m"usi"c producer on Vesa-Matti Lo'ir'i ’ s records.
However, Pälli ’ s g#reatest passion was radio wor[k, w:hich he did w.ith his own, un\ique style.
He worked in the radio since 19\60\s, and be-came familia+r to many listeners from Yle '[s ether.
Pälli ret-ir-ed in 1998.

Executive Director Mika K.ulm.al.a praises their fas^t reactions and stringent ec[onomic discipline.
Last au=t=umn, we responded quickly t=o the situation and ma}de adjustments.
C\areful planning o%f operations an;d f=inancial control are instilled in our wh.o.l.e organisation, Kulmala says in the press release.
We have als*o succeeded i&n p&artn&er a#c#quisit#ion, and in addition the profits from the world cups were maximal during the past s>eason.
Ho,wever, we must c_ontinu_e to be careful when managing expenses, and a%t the same time we mus\t constantly loo=k for new forms of f]inancing.
I h_eard my w#if#e cry for help, but t[hen silence
Do#zens of bodies l?ie in the h)ospital courtyard in the ci?ty of Palu, located on Indonesian island of Sul-a-wesi.

The p~a~t~ients are also treated outside because of th]e a.ftersho.cks.
One o}f the people moving i#n the hospital area w;as a 52-year-old Pa#lu resident Baharuddin, who was s(e(ar(chin(g for his son.
Like many Indonesians, h"e uses onl,y one name.
I h-ave one child, h$e ’ s missing.
I last spoke to him before he went t{o school in the morning, Baharuddin to,ld news a|g|ency A.FP.
Dw]i Haris, w\h\o was lying outside the hospital in Palu, ha$d suffered injuries in his ba^ck and a(r(m.
When th]e e(ar(t(hq(uak(e b"eg"a"n, he was in a local hotel with his wife a"n"d daughter.
The family had b>ee>n invited to Palu fo$r a wed,d,ing.
I was probably caught under a col<l<ap<sed w"al"l.
I heard my wif;e cr_y for he[lp, but then silence.
I don ’ t k^n^o^w what happ(ene(d to he`r and my child.
I hope they are safe, Haris to,ld news agency AP, according t>o Brit}ish med)ia.
Small s;hop;s are looted
I*n Palu evacuation centre, 35-year-old mother of a s&mall child Risa Kus!uma attempted t_o calm down her fev+erish baby.
She describ$ed the city atmosphere as t=ense.
There i{s little clean wat@e@r.
Small small s@h@o@ps are looted eve.ryw.here, said Kusuma.
Many Palu residents have slept outside o<r i-n temporary ba,mb,oo huts.
Even thou,gh their homes would still be some+how standing, the p=oss=i=ble aftershocks could destroy them for go#od, burying the res!id!en!ts.
Accordi}ng t`o ne?ws agency AP, over half the prisoners in Palu prison escaped after t}he prison walls collapsed.
Reportedly there were about 560 prisoners, so th;ere are perhaps abo{ut 300 f:ug:itives.
The Jakarta Post r$ep$or$t$s that also a p%art of Donggla prisoners have esca"ped.
According to the newspaper, the pri/s/oners got into a rage and set fire to the prison after t~he guard=s h"ad forbidden them fro/m leaving t}o sear=ch for their relatives who had suffered from the earthquake and the tsu&n&ami.
Palu airpor<t has been r[e-ope[ned mostly for relief flights.
One of the first t'o l:a:nd on th>e airport was a military C-130 t,rans,po,r,t aircraft bringing relief items.
Commercial flights to Pa_l_u airport ar~e a<llo<we<d only to a limited extent.
T,h,e pilots had t_o land to the airfield without air traffic cont,rol, because the control tower was badly damaged in t"h"e earth qu<ake.

We hoped she would b(e admi.tte.d to the university before going to a beaut]y contest
Russian father Dimitr}i an(d Ingrian mother Svetlana h@ad faith i>n their daughter ’ s success in Miss Finland final.
Parents of the new Miss Finland Alina Voronkova, Dimitri Voronkov a`nd Sve+t+lan+a Voronkova, were proud following t:h:eir daughter ’ s fi`rst moments weari{ng th}e crown.
They arrived to audience fr)om Pertunmaa, and planned to drive b^ack home a[fter the fi_nal.
The spi~r~its were wonderful!
We believed in Erika t'he whol[e ti*me, but half an hour before the results we we=re be,ginning to be nervous, Svetlana laughed.
Svetlana i#s Ingrian an>d Dimitri Russian.
Al(ina speaks fluent Ru+s+sian, even th$ough she has lived her whole childhood i>n Finland.
Svetlana s<a<ys that as a small child, A=l=ina was interested in acting and man)y oth.e.r things, rather than a beauty queen car/eer.
People we"re often commenting t*h*at Alin=a is so pretty she shou<ld be a beauty queen.
But s~h~e said she wanted to b;e a ra]dio host.
It was)n ’ t unt}il l'ate'r Alina got interested in beauty contests.
The parents hoped Alina would be admitted i_n the university before participating in M<i<s<s Finla;nd cont|est.
This becam}e true, and finally Alina wan^ted to complete her Bac-h-elor ’ s degree b~efore beauty contests.
We kept asking already last year why she w\on ’ t participate, but sh,e wan~ted t#o co,m,plete the Bachelor's.
The pa[rents believe Alina wo>n becau}se she is a wholesome example for young people and for adults, t.o.o.
S\he exer:cise:s a lot and eats a healthy diet.
And Alina likes to b"e in the limeli.ght, it s$h$o$ws.
Alina ’ s boyfriend Joonas Hurri is a profe%s%si%o%nal ice ho{c{key player in J{a{p{a{n, and he wasn ’ t able to come t@o Finland t(o sup}port his dearest in th`e final.
A_lina ’ s parents believe the pair ’ s relationshi{p will withstand the year a>s M<iss Finland.
It is me}ant to b]e!
Th\e parents hope their da]ug]hte]r would visit them soon.

Sari Piippo left h`er career in Brussels a^n^d became a stay-at-home mother in Finla{nd - got an ide-a of a comic an^d lack o$f draw;in;g skills did not slow her down
Luomuhömppä (‘ organic silly ’) originated from an utterance o*f my husba-n-d, when he su[gge[sted it could be a pers'on in a s'tory I was developing, d*es*cri*be*s Sari Piip|po, a com,ic blogger from Espoo, stay-at-home mother, and f!ormer EU tran=slato=r.
Sari Pi?ippo says she w[as an EU-translat.or i!n Brussels concentrating o]n economy and l]aw, until the family ’ s fo%urth child was born ten years ago and they became returning migrants.
I ’ ve loved being a stay-a{t-ho{me mot=h=er.
Thi-s has been the best t?ime of my life, b#ut at some point I started to wonder what t|o do when I grow up, an>d even my youngest one started t"o be pr,etty bi/g.
Th:en in 2014, comic came i&n.
Piipp^o says s`he had nev^er even dreamed about making a comic, e$ven though she had be*en reading Donald D,uck, T}intin, and Asterix ever since she was little.
I h=adn ’ t drawn since childhood, but when these scripts for Luomuhö)mpp)ä th)en start\ed to emerge, the situ'at'ion changed.
First I crea\ted some dozens o~f scripts for my own ple?a?sure.
My daughter Viivi Valkama (b . 2000) is a sk,illed dra;wer, but I did!n ’ t manage to pers%uad%e her to hel\p me until s+umm+e+r 20;16, when I bri#bed Viivi with a drawing tablet.
Her enthusiasm lasted for about a dozen strips, a$n$d t{h{en I had t,o start trying myself, Pii!p!p!o laughs and say"s t,he drawing tablet w[as a great supporter for her.
A drawing tablet i=s an e,asy a*nd handy way to try to g`e`t something done.
I didn ’ t even try to draw on a paper, Piippo de+scribes he>r relationship w:ith drawing, w{hi{c{h s{h{e usually does in t"he evenings.
Scr"ipt"s p&op up in my mind al\l the time, but us^ual^l^y I never finish a comic at on=e go.
A single t_hree-p_an_el strip may take even se#veral hours.
I ma'y do one panel at a time a#nd I l-ove to play with colo+ur+s.
Beginning to draw is always the m`o`st diffficult thing, s,in,ce drawing isn ’ t m/y for_t_e.
Sari Piippo says t@ha@t when i(t comes to mode;rn comics i"n newspapers, s&h&e appreciates for example Dilbert by Scott Adams.
Characters of Luomuhömppä inc.lude a carrot-figured mother, obsessed with everything organi$c a~nd head f\ull of lettuce hair.
Other characters are M#ies (Husb?and), P$i$s$si$s (T*e*en Girl), and Kaksoset (Twins).
In the world of Luomuhömppä y/ou are w:hat y$o$u eat.
The ideas for t+he comic com/e fr[om the creator's own life a_n_d social media.
Sari Piippo does n&ot want to preach or for'ce any i(deas, e;ven though there are occasionally more serious sub^jects in Luomuhömppä.
Piippo says she has her husband a,nd chil;d;ren rea~d the comic.
It ’ s a really g@re@at feeling t*o look at a com$ic you ’ v)e drawn and t\h\ink that this is w&h&at I did today.
T}here's challenge enough f!or a stay-at-home mother!

Indonesian earth quake: An a"ir traffic co>ntro>l>ler sacrified himself - did!n ’ t leave a frac[tured t|ower until he managed to save hundreds o}f travellers

Rehn pondered the possibility of Europe esc}alating i]n a trade wa/r at Yle “ W#e must se-e the next tweet ”
The trade war between the United State~s and C>hina i(s reflected in t!he world economy as a whole.
Growth forecasts h[ave been lowered throughout Europe, and als%o th/e Bank of Finland has s]light]ly lowered its own ec*on*om*i*c growth estimates.
Speaking a`t Yle Ykkösaamu, Governor Olli Rehn said t"ha"t even though incr!easin!g tensio/n has no direct effect on Euro\pea\n flow of trad!e, it does w[ea[ken the trust, which i=n turn is ref"le"cted on companies ’ investment decisions.
The sam"e applies t<o the impacts of Finnish companies ’ exp?orts.
Rehn thinks so fa!r Europe has tak[e[n good care of its d@u@t@ies.
It ha?s b*een able to create a truce with the Unite>d States, and, for its part, calme}d the situ%ation down also with China a}nd Japan.
Rehn does n`o`t thin'k that Europe will be ground under the feet o>f a trade wa+r.
We must s^ee the next t-weet and make estimations afte!r that.
Our partner in Washington is quite un"pred"ictabl"e, h\e however s'aid i#n the Yle interview.
Europe also h%as its o@wn risks.
One o|f t#h#em is the third largest euro are$a economy Italy, which is also on{e o"f the mo+st indebted states in the euro area and the w=hole Western world.
The market h/a/d a severe reaction t#o a budget showing a c@l@ear deficit pres#ent#ed by the Italian government on Thursday even%i%n%g.
Next year's de'fi'cit is over 2.4 p_er ce;nt of GDP.
Rehn considers I)tali)an situ`ation to be alarming.
Five p[er cent of the c`ountr`y ’ s loan stock are problem l!oans, and over ten per cent a@r@e unregulat&ed loans.
In addition, the public finan-ce-s are s?hak?y, an|d again it seems that the coun{try is goi.ng to exceed its liabilities i?n relation to its European partners.
Ma*ybe we should not yet b+e imagining new crises, Rehn replied when inquired whe.t.her It:al:y i.s leading Europe to a new economic crisis.
Another m{a{tte{r taxing Europe is British de>parture f!ro!m the EU.
Rehn hopes it can be se@ttl@ed a,t peace.
A quarrelsome exit would h.ave mu:ch more negative effects.

It probably is al}l right, i*f the<re a>r>e Finnish names involved, Rehn sa%id, adding t=hat he has no further comments on the matter.

A mis?s?ing mushroom pic:ker found thanks to an ‘ unconventional exp(eriment ’
The Finnish Police's drone skills are the top o{f t{he w&or&ld: ‘ We are asked t[o provid@e training ’
According to the Director o+f the Police University College, i?n addition to looking for missing persons, t@he police ca$n u!se a drone in c:rime scene investigation and in intelligence ope@rations.
O.n T?ue?s?da?y, using a drone, Oul`u po"lic"e found a missing mushroom picker in Raahe in only a few min.ut.e.s.
The Di|re|ct|or of the Police University College, Kimmo Him~berg, tw!eete!d about the case and mentioned for e:xample that ‘ thanks to unconventional experimenting and eff{ic{ient traini%ng, w.e are at the top o'f the w`orld also in this ’.
Drone i[s a fairly new d+ev+ice, an*d even newer in police operations.
Th{e{r{e are n:o statistics available about Finnish police being a master in drone us[e.
According to Him#berg, there is a w&id&e co-ns-ensus about this.
This has been obvious for e"x"ampl"e when Finnish police's experienc"es have been reported i(n int=er=national events.
There i)s a lot of interest towards i>t elsewhere, Hi.m.berg says.
There are many, w&ho are a?re ke@en to v^i^sit Finland to see the police ’ s drone operations.
We are asked to provid%e t{ra{i{ni{ng.
Becomes m{ore and more common
Himberg points out that i\n Finnish winter conditions, findi&ng a missing person a"s soon as p=ossibl=e is vital.
As stated, in Ra[a[he ca;se the missing per,s,o,n was fou]nd i&n just a couple of minutes using a drone.
Finnish Polic>e has alre^ady trained hundreds of drone pilots.
According to Himberg, t!he plan i?s to tra;i;n more.
Alre^ady n]ow the drone is used a lot in police operations, and their us)e will increase and become more comm@on i]n the future.
I d\are to s-ay this, Himberg says.
In addition to fin_ding missing people, Himberg say"s the police can use dr_o_ne_s i.n, for exa@mp@le, ac.cid.ent or crime scene investigation and in certain k,inds of intelligence operations.
For example if a`n area must be reviewed from a distance, i|f t!here is a possible threat o'f violence the(re.
In thes%e cases, a dron]e can be used for advanc(e inquiry.
Karjalan Rugby prom>oted to the fi@rst division
Karjalan Rugby celebrated their 2nd div\i\si\on w(in i(n Kuopio on Saturday.
During t|he halftime, the J.oe.nsuu team w~as still losing 7-12 to Helsinki Rugby Club, but du`ri`ng the second half th+ey s&tar&t&ed to get the hang of the game, defeating t|heir southern g'u'ests 26-12.
T'he 2nd division title also means t(h(a(t Karjala Rugby will b-e promoted to the fi$rst division, a his{to{ric event.
The team ha)s played in t#h#e fi]rst already befo*re, but back then Finnish ru.gby series was divid;ed into two levels, FC series a=n=d 1st division that had several groups.
The team plans t&o accept the league status, but it mea+ns a lot off wor$k for nex{t winter.
The current player roster of less than tw>enty players must be inc$rea$sed to 2{5.
1]s]t d>ivisio>n a'lso means more games and longer game trips, so the funding must be organ&ised accordingly.
Kotkaniemi to begin his season i[n Mont#rea#l, head coach conf"ir"ms
The h<ead coach of NH$L team Montreal Canadiens, Claude Julien, conf@ir@m@ed o*n the team ’ s T^wit^ter account th;at th+e Finnish forward Jesperi Kotkaniemi begins his season in Montreal.
Montreal reserved the prodigy Kotkaniemi, 1-8, during the fi_rst round as number three in t?he s)ummer ’ s Entry Dra)ft.
Th~e f^o^rwar^d joi)ned Montreal p$rac$tice strength in the late summer, and has perfomed well i[n the September practice matches.
Kotkaniemi managed to score in his ver;y fir+st practice ma~tch.
The he:a:d c,oac,h Julien said the Finn has ta:ken big development steps since he arr{ived at the rookie camp.
NH,L s\e\as\on begins next w}eek the night between Wednesday and Thursday Finnish time.

Wh{at i*s a good leader like?
T(his week Finland has h}ear}d a lot o\f discussion about leadership.
Chairman of No^kia, Ri~s~to Siil;asmaa, discussed his book Transforming Nokia that d`eals with his leadership philosophy in an interview for H\elsing\in Sanom?at (HS).
A+t the same ti}m}e he criticises his predecessor chairman Jorma Oll"ila's leadership style.
Ollila categorically denied the claims, but also e"arl"ier reports on Nokia have dis(cusse(d the leaders ’ inability to work a`s a t)eam; the cul(tur(e of fear a,n,d sile$nce that in part ca_used the down]fa]ll of the mobile phone business.
The risk-taking capa?c?ity and agil)ity o_f the company's rise period were lost.
This week also saw the business lif>e me%ga event Nordic Busin#e#ss Forum organised in H@e@l@sinki . The eve_nt gathered the cream of Finnish busines.s to Messukeskus.
In addition to the main sta?r Bara+ck Obama, 12 stars of business wo]r]ld were seen on the st!age.
Th+e+re was a lo't of talk about good leadership.
Leadership theory legend Gary Hamel said that a good leader must hav.e the courage to take a company to th>e future also whe'n everyt)hin)g is go_ing fi*n*e.
T-h-e problem i:s that decisions are ma,de by those, who are most mentally bound to the dec\isi\o\ns of t]h]e past.
John Mackey, the founder o(f Whole Foods supermarket chain known fo:r its e+xten+siv+e organic product selection, said a leader has to b~e able t"o convey t)he company meaning to the whole st,aff.
And that meaning h'a's to b?e something more besid%es simply making profit for the owner}s.
Au.thor o|f a su_cces_sful book on introverts, Susan Cain expla>ined research has proven the most successful leaders to be hum#bl#e.
They ac\t i$n a peaceful, quiet, and d]ete]rm]in]ed manner.
Often th;ey are introverts.
Professor o\f Finance Aswath Damodaran reminded the listeners that a good leader '(s characteristics must m`a`tch th^e company ’ s life cycl'e stage.
I]n the early stage of the company a lead>e>r must be able t`o tell a sto`ry on which the company's f|uture is founded.
A company grown to a matur{e stag]e needs a leader who know t$he numbers.
These lessons were attended by 7,}5}00 No~rd~ic Business Forum visitors - mostly Fi-n-ni-sh leaders.
The!y were at a risk of an information ove&rload.
Being a good leader requi\res a lo(t.
Tha|t is why leadership so often fails, also on the hig;he;st l(evel.
Siilasmaa and O^l^li^l^a were also pre,sent.
They ha=d a friendly discussion beh/ind-t/he-sce/n/es.
Though they wer}e hardly contemplating whether t|he|y were the right leaders f)or Nokia at th|e right time.
And their humili"ty was not easy t_o estimate as a.n outsider.

We cannot yet disclose where the car wa"s found, say?s H@enr@ik Storm for/m Copenhagen police communications t&o Ilta-Sanomat.
According to Storm, the police does n(ot believe t>he missing bla(ck Volvo h-as no direct connection to the thr`ea`t.
According to him, t|h|e biggest dang(er is over.
Danish Ekstra Bladet rep*orted the police press b]rie]fing on Satur$day.
The officer in charge of the inves[tigati[on, Jø!rgen Berg\en Skov, k*ept silent abo"ut the progress of the operation.
He did not want to te;ll t&he category o|f the offence for the inv=esti=gated case.
Skov did however s(ay i;t is a ‘ se/rious crime ’.
It was a ma`tter o(f threat to human life.
Three people have been searched fo:r duri,ng the operation.
The police do not say wheth!e!r th|ey ha`ve been already caught.
According t~o t>h>e newspaper, the ferry service limitations have b:e:en cancelled.
Th>e Copenhagen pol[ice followed the events also vi"a their Twitter account.
STT reports that according to the police, th'e g}ene}ral publ&ic has no reason to worry, because th@e t~hreat was directed a.t certain people.
The name of Macedonia has been a cau.se for disagreement for decades - now t>h>e nation v&otes on the issue i@n a quarrelsome v[ote
Macedonia, located i&n the Balkans, is currently voting on the propo`s`it`ion for the cou/ntry's new n:ame.
According t<o a deal between Macedonian and Greek g'o'v'ernme'nts, the name would be Rep;ublic o*f North Macedonia.
S{o f+ar Greek has vetoed Macedonia ’ s bids t:o join NATO and EU.
Ac:cording to Greece, Macedonia is the name o\f i.ts northern region.
The question i|n t<he referendum does not mention a new name, but inquires whether t[h[e vot*e*r support Macedonian membership in E/U a:nd NATO by accepting the deal.
T-he voting had a slow start a<t least in a s}chool located in the centre of capital city Sko(pje.
A retired nurse Olivera Argirosvka, w_ho voted a/t the s{chool, hoped that the deal gains s`up`p`ort.
Referendu|m means chan_g_e, if it opens the d"oors to Europe and to NATO.
I't means change especially f%o%r the young people, s[he said.
In official communications, the na`me used for Macedonia, in}depe}ndent since 19@91, has bee}n the former Yugoslav Republic o-f Macedonia.
Prime Minister Zoran Z/aev ’ s gover=nmen=t has campaigned for th/e ratification o}f the deal.
T%he nationalist right wing opposition, including the President Gjorge Ivanov, ha've encourage)d people t(o boycott the referendum.
In addition t)o the result, there is the the voter turn{out to wait for: wh!eth!er it wi`ll b,e over the required 50 p_er cent.
The referendum i@s not binding, but if the ye@s vot.es win, i`t would give a mand&ate to change the constitution.
To change th>e constitution, a majority of tw@o thi;rd;s in the parliament is re,quire,d.
Th_e Greek p&arliam&en&t also has to ratificate the deal.
The polling stations a,re c*l*os*ed eight o ’ clo,ck in the evening Finnish time.

Students act a rare tr}e}at: a classical tragedy - s:imple Oresteia impresses wi.th its v!isualit!y.
Classical tragedies are a rare trea$t o'n Finnish stages.
For example, there has n%ot been a c-lassical tr$agedy in the Finnish National Theatre s]ince Sophocles ’ Philoctetes in 199(8.
Now Theatre Academy t?ak?es the on\ly complete classical tri@logy, Oresteia by A'esc'hylus, to a tour that begins from t,h,e National Theatre.

Dram+ati+c lights and presentation revea{li{ng the s!ides of the theatr]e space emphasise the simple and clear stage thinking.
I:n the centre of i$t alternates the dynamics between a}ctors p`layin`g main roles, stepping forward from the chorus in turn, and th)e c}horus.
The performance utilise.s b\o\th d$ouble and triple portrayals of the main roles.
Th%e actors never leave the stage, s"o also for example the murde%rs of Ag_ame_mnon, who re"turns from th+e war of Troy, and his prize of war, Cassan`d`ra, are sho-wn on the stage, unlike in the c/l/assical tradition.
Of course t!he perfo~r~manc~e does not even claim to b"e faithful to th'e classical performance tradition.
I`f anything, the viewer is presented with a modern interpr^et^at^io^n, f,ai,thful to the te+xt, and continuously aware of its ritual-like root{s.
Roiha has managed t<o cr,eat,e a rhy)t)hmi)c gro!up from the Master-level actor students, a group t'hat performs as a tight-knight team, even a|s a single organism.
The ch'orus parts especially a$r$e where th@e actor`s and their very expressive, sculpture-like group formations do themselv@es justice i=n the bare stage adorned only by a white curtain.
I]mp]ressive.

Fists were doing the talking o"n several occasions i+n Kajaani
A man in his thirties assaulted t^hr^ee men in a restaurant in t~he centre of Kajaani and i|n f#r#ont o@f i%t on Saturday after midnight.
First t~he man hit a man inside the restaurant, after which h`e was removed from th/e pre~mises.
Outside he pushed another man t%o the ground, and as a thi|rd m%an intervened in th(e situation, the attacker h]it h|im, too.
The polic(e se@i@zed the attacker.
The man continued to act in a^n aggressive manner in t,he police sta!t!ion, kic>ki>ng one o~f the police in the leg.
The man a%lso threatened to assault a}nd kill the pol]ice.
The man was ta!k!en int%o police custody to calm d\own.
The i@nc@ident i?s investigated as th=ree assaults a{nd a violent resisting of an official in t/he performance of his duties.
Also another assault took place on V"ä"l"ikatu in the c@entre of Kajaan"i on Saturday after mi"d"night.
A v'i'ct'im was assaulted b(y two men.
First a Kajaani ma(n in his twe(ntie(s hit t@he victim.
A while later another man knocked him down, a/nd the ma>n w[ho earlier hit h"i"m f$u$rthe$r kicked the victim.
Outsiders pul^l^ed the attackers away from th&e victim and the police wa[s called.
Th,e offenders however manag{ed to leave befo'r'e the police arrived.

A long-t'erm radio h~ost Erkki Pälli has died
Er`kki Pälli, known as Yl*e's long-time journalist d|i|ed of cancer aged 83.
Radio host Erkki Pälli, 8@3, has di]ed.
H^e passed away of terminal liver ca~ncer he told about on h|i|s Facebook page in Mar:ch 2018.

Ev\en the doctor has said i`t, I live one da"y a"t a time, he commented his s^i^tuati^on to Iltalehti a month ago.
Th~e security of ladies and men i#n shops must b<e guaranteed
The first t$ime I was paid for a newspaper story w`as in 19#84.
With this level of ex;perience, when a news story m!an!ages to astonish m:e, it i@s usually a bi:g thing.
When I wrote (Kar(ja(laine(n, 2.7.9 .) about the insecurity of workers i%n retail, I was astonished and occ|asion|ally ev_en a bit ang]ry.
For that story, I also talk@ed with Erika Kähärä, S&ervice Union United (PAM) special`ist in w:orki:ng envi%r%onments.
Sh~e says the cri&me statistics do not reveal the actu;al situation.
This is a growin$g problem, even thou$gh employers naturally claim other|w|ise.
The police are informed onl=y about those c%as%es that are cle>ar>ly serious, and ma~ny real violent situat$io$ns are left unreported.
‘ B$a$sed on the Occupational Safety and Health Act t,h,e c'ompanies certainly have a responsibility to compile statistics of thei"r close call sit;uation;s, but th"ese s<tat<istics are for internal use only, and their inf@ormatio@n is not collected anywhere ’, she sai*d.
The mental injuries a>r>e n(ot included in the statistics.
Violent situations alw>ays have had the problem tha:t the:re do not always result in physical inju.ries.
D;es;pite this, psychological tra,umas can be much more severe th:an bruises and cuts.
It i<s difficult to draw a l>ine between a violent situation a}nd an im>pend>ing violent situation, since also aggre)ss)i)ve threats of a certain level must be considers a[s violence - even though there w(as no physical violenc@e.
T{oo many ar?e a-frai-d at their workplace, e#ven though no actual violence would happen.
Some neighbourhoods are trou#bled.
The s*h*op has hired s*e*cur*ity guards.
When the business opening ho<urs became deregulated, there was a lot of discussion also in th@e media ab)out i)ts ef:fects to the salespersons ’ sa"f"ety.
‘ Back t-h-en quite a few employers orga`nised se+c+u+rity g\uards fo)r at least the night-time hours and to preve#nt working alone ’, Kähärä commented.
When nothing h]appe]ns, w-r-ong conclusions are drawn.
This seems to h`ave had a!n effectiv{e influence, but this brings about a n/ew negative trend.
W.he.n security managed to control the disturbances, a(n impression wa@s created that this security would be u=nne=c=ess=a=ry.
Now ma@ny pl]aces are looking for solutions to eliminate exp.ensive security services.
Petty a&ss&aul&t is an actionable of(f(e(nc(e, and i.t is quit+e understandable that an assaulted salesperson does not want to make a request f{o{r investigation about a@n off,ender who usuall:y lives close to the shop.
B?ut, acc=or=ding to a s!ubsecti!on in the s)ame 20,1,1 act, petty assault is under a pr$osecuti$one$r ’ s jurisdiction, if it takes place in a workplace.
I thin{k we need preced&en&ts now.
The next time a shop lady or man is assau\lted, t$he police should investigate and t-he prosecutor p,ros,ecu,t,e.
Af<ter a cour.t would put a few assailants to prison, and i>f th|e judgement is from t-he tougher en/d o.f the penal scale, the manners would smarten up.
A society that requires a small place food shop t!o be open nearly da:y and nigh should guaran:tee t-he safety of s\ho\p assistants.
He^idi Sohlberg taunted a beau>ty queen before live broad^cas^t - ‘ Sar?a, remember that Iiro is married ’
This year, the beauty que]en c@oronation won ’ t be seen traditionally o<n T$V, but i*t ’ s broadcast via Viafree site.
The show wil+l b[e h,o,s,ted by ex Miss Finland, Heidi Soh:lberg, and the host of Viasat's and Viaplay's NH^L a$n$d KHL studios, Iiro Harjula.
The ho@s@t for backstage and re^d carpet is Janni Hu<ss<i.
Before live broadcast, the host trio informed t+he invited guests an;d media rep"resentatives present abo:ut ho:w the broadcast will progress.
In the be:ginn:ing, So,h,lbe,rg asked the audience to g,ive Harjula resounding applauds.
Scr,eam now, ladies!
Lo^ok at our male ho*st, Sohlberg enthused ove?r her colleague while the a&udienc&e cheered.
Many Miss Finlands from earlier years follo!w th:e contest from the fir's't row.
Among others, Sara Chafak and S#ara Sieppi were sitting n)e)xt to each ot`he`r, and Sohlberg cracked a joke to either o^f the[m.
Sara, remember th_a_t Iiro i/s married!
Sohlberg cr\ac\ked, looking at Sara*s.
Most likely S`o`hberg directed her joke t=o recently divorced Sieppi, who laughed at th.e c{omment, even though she first l:ooked confused.
Siep!pi discussed h-er divorce t!h!e first time in Ilta-Sanomat weeked newspaper.
The beau\ty queen said sh=e doesn ’ t w&ant to publicly open u~p about t:h:e reasons f<or the divorce, because that is just between her and Roope Salminen.
S@he said she ’ s in n}o hurry to fi<nd a new relationship, b_u_t th>at she is going to focus on herself.
I will focus on my own things, and a!b!ove all, will begin to live my li]f]e b`y myse)lf, S)ara Sieppi said.
Harjula's marital sta\tus e}mer}ge}d also later, w^h^en Sohlber:g accidentally called Janni Hussi and Iiro Harjula a couple.
T<he host trio shared a laugh a`t the blunder.
W=a=sn't Iiro m,a,rried, or how was it?
Janni Hussi a{cknowledged th]e mistake.
An Ostrobothnian man tortured his d@o@me@stic partner b)y s(las(hing, burning and feeding a strong sauce t<o her
P~oh~janmaa (Ostrobothnia) District Court has senten)ced the 3?4-year-ol?d Kokkola resident to three years o$f imprisonment for t_he numerous crimes ag?ai?nst his domestic partner.
The means of com+missio+n o)f the offenc%e include, among other^s, a belt, a cable, an"d cable ties.
The court sentenced these objects forfeited t(o th\e state.
Th;e most severe charge concerned a suspected agg%ravated rape.
This charge was however di/smissed b]y the district court.
The Kokkola man was considered guilty of four assaults, an~d aggravated assault, coercion, illega(l threat, deprivation o+f liberty, aggravated de=p=rivati=on o}f liberty, and tw#o malicio)us damages.
T[he c^rimes were committed between the 26th of last Ma#rch and 24th of las(t May.
A"f"te"r th?e final deeds, the man wa-s apprehended and detained a couple of d$ays later.
On Thursday o)f th(e past week, Pohjanmaa District Court passed its judgement and rul{e{d that the 34-year-old must continue to be kep]t in Va}asa pri?son.
No proof ab\out the rape
T-h-e 34-year-old wa*s also ac/cu/sed of two aggra/v/a/t/ed de(p(ri(vations of liberty and of an aggravated rape on the 22nd of May.
The court however dro*pped these charges as un^s^ub^s^tantia^ted.
T,h,e case w<a<s tried behind closed doors.
The district court judge gave a public report on t&he sen<te<nce, th^ou^gh.
According t-o the district co}ur}t judge, t'he accused had directed violence, threatening, and coercion to his domestic partner in situations wher:e sh}e was ti}ed.
Th:e accused s@lashed his victim with a k*nife, burned her w~ith a cigarette, fed her s<trong sauce, and poured water and coffee o@n her.
With its s>en>tence, the court orde}red that t}he means of commission of the offence we_r_e t'o be forfeite}d to th*e state: a belt and a cable, cable ties, a bathrobe bel"t, a k*nife, and a billhook.
Four witnes=s=es
According to the dist!rict court, the parties con:tinued living together between the d#eeds.
The judicial decisi{on states that a large number of th~e most serious deeds hap+p+ened in t'he end o@f the crime period.
Four witnesses wer'e heard i^n t^h^e court, two women and two men.
The 34-year-old m"u"st pay 5800 euros as compensation f:or pain, ache, suffering, and tem%po%rary d~a~mage.
Doubtfully he has such mon'ey, sin%ce the convict al~rea~dy has earlier debts i!n collection.
The im)priso)nment is not the man's f)irst.
Iltalehti will not publ*is*h th*e name of the conv{ic{t in order to protect t$he victim ’ r privacy.
During the time of wr]it]ing, the recent district court sentence i)s not non-{a{p{pealable.
Euro,pe in a four-point le_ad to Ryder Cup finals
European golf professionals streng)thened their lead ag{ainst Un$ited States in the traditional mat|ch play game on Saturday.
Europe leads 10-6 in Ryder Cup played near Paris, when t;here ar@e still twelve S)unday twosom/es coming.
Europe won t@hree of the four four-ba<ll matches tha<t began Saturday, and in the afternoon foursomes t~he wi&ns were shared 2-2-.
E_urope_an g]u]idi]ng lights were Tommy Fleetwood and F#rancesco Molinari, who won all the f`our matches th'ey played as a pair during Friday and Sat\urday.
Ea'rlier no Europea<n pair has reached a feat like th\at.
On Sunday the twosome attempt to mak`e more hi\story.
N.o European player has w\on fi#ve p'oints in a single Ryder Cup, and only th=r=ee A+mer+icans have managed such achievement: Arnold Palmer and Gardiner Dickinson (1969) and Larry N;e;lson (197,9).
HJK c~ondemns its supporters violent troublemaki@n@g i[n the m;a;tch against Honka: ‘ Violence does not belong to football ’
Veikkausliiga premier division football team HJK issued a pre<ss release on Sun=day, denouncing its supporte'rs disruptive behaviour in the m]atch against FC Ho]nka in Tapiola o^n Saturday.
‘ On behalf of our supporters, we apologise t"he events that took place af{te{r th\e Ho.nka-HJ.K match ’, the press release st$ates.
After the match, circa 50 HJK supporters rus#h#ed to t%he field, an+d some seemed to b&e trying to start a fight w{ith Honka sup%porters.
And a figh?t also broke out between th`e supporters.
S\ec\urit\y offi$c$ers did no:t manage to calm t,he situation down, but police officers an{d also mounted police officers were needed.
HJK '"s press release states the team players a?nd officials a+re shocked about the i"ncid"en"t.
The after-match incidents are against the values of our lon!g-established team o+f 111 yea-r-s.
‘ We absolutely dissoci$ate o`ursel`ves from all such activ;ity that endangers th+e match safety ’, the press release decla~res.
H!JK promises to aid the au`th`o`rit`ie`s an?d event or-ganisers in investigating th;e potential elements threatening safety, and in removing unwanted side effects.
Fan cul$ture is a part of f*ootball and an important thing t^o HJK.
W?e will in every way support positi_v_e, h_a_pp_y, and encouraging activiti{es in football stands.
‘ Vi`olenc`e i#s not part o'f that ’, the press release says.
A Phi,lip,pine inventor fli|e|s with a drone car - this is how y#ou avoid tr!affic jams
Men$diol$a is a Philippine inventor, hip h*op dancer, and a Gyro Gear^loos^e of som`e sort.
He is one member of t^h^e growing group wh/o swear to have inv.e.nted a flying ca"r - or at lea<st t:heir own version of it.
H"e has com`petito`rs such as Audi and Airbus.
However, Mendiola does not belie[ve i`n the mass manufacturing of hi;s vehicle.
According t"o reports from from the world, h/e has used a great d/eal of hi;s fortune to build hi@s dream.
Si!x years ag*o he began developing his flying car.
Now h}e ca+l+ls his development version a dron car.
He say^s he recentl(y conducted the first successful tes\t flight - h:e floated i+n over seven metres with his machine.
One o>f his goals was to avoid traf&fic jam.
I hope the machine evok:e:s po#sitive reactions.
Five years a=g=o t'his was jus/t a dream, Mendiola said according t{o British Daily Mail.
JH=L anticipates: Industrial action beginning to]morrow wi&ll be visible in children ’ s daycare and i{n social a!nd health services
Overtime a}nd shift-trading ban<s beginni#ng tomorrow in t]he public and welfare sectors concern espec"ial"ly social and health services and children ';s daycare, estimate(s Päi}vi Niemi-Laine, President of J-HL (the Trade Union for the Public and Welfare Sectors).
The impac(t w=ill be wide, and it will most certainly manifest in not having enough sta{ff availa>ble.
Everyone has t+o th?i?nk about how t}o collect their children.
The employer ’ s task now is to take care o|f the services and th<at n>o on\e ’ s life i>s i"n danger, Niemi-Laine says to STT.
According to Niemi-Laine, the l^ack of employees was visible also in the beginning o$f the y>e>a>r, when JH)L members were b#a#nned fro@m overtime and shift-trading because of agreement negotiat(ions.
Throu_g_h the#ir flexibility, the employers have made po)ssi)b)le to not hir{e staff, but use employees ’ ov&ertime or shift-trading.
This is n'ot yet an industrial acti`on.
When talking about occupational safety and health, it is a no>r>mal thing to take care that each employee h!as regular w`orking hours a_nd works on_ly those re=gular hours.
With these actions, JHL oppo<s<es the governments attempts to weaken the lay-off pr]ot]ectio]n i'n small bu.sin.e.sses.
Labour market d,irector for municipal employers Markku Jalonen will not estimate th}e effects of overtime a|nd shift-t]ra]ding bans in a>dvance.
H#o#w#ev#e#r, he does not beli{eve them t`o be very revolutionary, eve&n if the services can weaken.
Emp!l!oyers around Finland are aware of this and have m<ade th,e possible preparations.
Th[e public, we[lfare an-d technical se@c@tor covers such a wide area that it is difficult to say anything.
The effects ca{n very quite a lot depending on fiel\d, region, and employer, J]alonen told ST=T.
Jalonen s#aid som{e e"xper"iences were received a|lready last week when the Finn%is%h Union of Practical Nurses Su?pe?r a!nd the Union of H'e'a'lth and Social Care Professionals Tehy, among others, organised similar three-day actions.
The"i"r effects r+em+ained quite small.
JHL overtime and trade-shift ba<n ap+pli+es to f^or example employ}ees in municipalities, church, and state, as we!ll a>s in private social and health sector.
For exa^mple family daycare providers have been excluded f|rom t$he ban.
At this st#age, the industrial action applies to n-early 1&0&0,000 JHL members.
According to Nie%mi%-L%aine, JH;L acti;ons can potentially last for a long time.
The uni)on is prepared to take oth\er industrial actions, if drafting of th+e lay-off b(ill continues.
The government should now recognise that the;y are running agains#t a wall in hig[h spee.d.
In Jalonen ’ s opinion, both t:he trade union movement an.d the government must m;ee;t the other h-alfw-ay.
The unusual thing here is that people are a}lready pul_ling out their big guns, e,ven though th&e proposition h;as yet to be made, wonders J(a(l(onen.
G;reat Barrier Reef is formed by children and adults - p%erformance exerci#ses consist of learnin[g the motions o}f a ray and a sea horse
Gre|at Barrier Reef by Oth:er Spaces collective had its premiere last spring in Hamburg, a]nd last Saturday was its second performance in Fi)nl)and, this time i(n Ka'nnel't'al'o.
J%ust like the previous performance of the grou&p, Great Barrier Reef is a performance that is created t|o|g|ether with th]e audience from the beginning until th#e e_n_d.
This t?im?e, how=e=v=e=r, also a more clearly-defined performance is f\o\rmed to refresh and d@istil the perceptions from th+e beginning exercises.
There i^s plenty of fantastical magic in this theatre pl[ay al^so for children participants.
A chi!ld ’ s v!iew h*as been considered also in the preparatory s{tage of the performance.
Still, Gre|at B:ar:rier Reef is not a children ’ s perfor!man!ce, but a performance formed in co-operation b/e/tween the adults and th?e chil}dr}en.
I(t gives t?he adult]s knowledge and observations about the way children receive information and create a'rt.
The children ’ s ability to throw themselves in t!he exercis/es and co*mmo*n games also dispel?s the distance between g&row&n-up&s and children.
Great Barrier R#eef h|as a little bit of a fairy-tal;e ballet, circuit training, and natu+re-+t+hemed lesson in it, b^ut i~ts final setting is organised around different visits to non-?h?um?an situations.
Great Barrier Reef begins with learning about corals an*d ab+o+ut movements o%f organisms a*nd fish who live within the r-eef.
Six dif[ferent exercis$e grou#p#s teach for example abou|t the motions of a ray and a seahorse.
Fina[lly a performance lasting a l]ittl]e under a=n hour is fo;rmed, and in i=t the music, lights, shiny paints and c(ostume(s help in getting t:o know t@h@e life within the coral reef.
I~n Great Barrier Reef, th\e participants ar:e both diving people observing the life within the reef, and corals th-at ar!e being observed.
They also play th*e part of organisms ob#serving corals.
The looks at many dif)ferent directions and perce>p>t>ion>s create a performance that is dense an&d teeming w$ith life.
T&o be an organism ’ s vi-ew, a(nd organism observing a v'iew, or a=n organism or view observing another organism - and all this a-t the same ti;me.
Children seem t"o have n$o problems to do this.
Oth+e+r Spaces collective ’ s exercis:es aim to reach th@e limit between thinking and action, bu,t it is challenging to reach it whe*n the gro;up is comprised of both children a)nd adults.
On the other hand, children ’ s part'ici'pation m,ak,e,s it mo[r[e meaningful.
After the workshop, a si/lent demon|strat|io|n for endangered coral"s is organised at Sitratori.
On)e should not let themselves be hardened by the destruction surpassing hum!a!n unders*tandin*g, even th#oug#h it ca@n be difficult to understand the significance of pra]ct]i]sin]g on^e ’ s own compassion in the face of these visio@ns of destruction.
Ot=h=er Spaces has cr]ea]ted its performance in such a way that it hon,our,s the variety o>f life also w>ith a political gesture.
There are also other gene"r"a"tions, other consciousnesses, other spec(ies an"d their future generations i!t clears the way fo(r.
Children grow up too fast - I ’ m happy t=here we;r;e n*o smart phones when I was a chi.ld
Present-day children a$nd young people ar\e more and more i&rrespon&s&ible.
Y~oung people start smokin.g and drinking when they ’ re younger an+d younger.
I th^in^k children should b@e children thoughout their childhood, and not mess u>p the*ir lives because of intoxicants and s.e.x, bec@a@use all the others s?ay they are doing that.
I was taken aback, when m=y friend told me sh%e had h+ad to pi"ck up her fift+h-+f+ormer sister from her ‘ boy<f<riend ’ s ’ house during weekend.
When she came to get her drunken s;i;s;ter, sh`e told abou~t her sex experiences from t|hat evening.
I could ’ ve not im{agine{d m*y own sister i/n t_he same situation, because thro+ughout our childhood we ';ve b'een told and advised that we should not touch intoxicants and s*ex is an adult thing.
I hope present-day ch_ildren co}uld liv<e a proper ch_ildh_o_o_d, and th(ey wouldn ’ t n@ee@d to grow up too early because of the peer pressure created by friends.
I keep seeing yo-ung-er and younger girls on Instagram, wearin_g make-up and rev)ealing c'lothes in their pictures.
Snapch=at is us@e@d during evenin-g to take and send revealing pictures.
I<t i[s m#or#e and more difficult to guess, which age the girls are.
Present-day 13-year-olds can easily loo#k like th=ey ’ r{e 18 or even older.
My childhood consisted o{f playing in the f,ores,t and boar#d#games.
I ’ m ha|ppy there were no smart phones w^h^en I w;as a child.
I got to be a child for many, m`any years, an.d I didn ’ t hav<e t]o w#onder what others thi:n:k about me.
Y(le: O|fficial have told the political lead"er"s that t.he case Airiston Helmi ha(s nothing to do with national security.
In an int~erv~i~ew with Yle, Ilkka Kanerva said Finnish Security I$ntel$ligence Service and Finnish D.efe.nce Forces cam.e to inform th!e Defence and the Foreign Ri&ghts C.o.mmittees earlier this week.
The Fin?nish state le-ade-rship has been t~o~ld that Airiston Hel$mi investigation currently has nothing t(o do wi&th national security, but organised crime, Yle reports.
The anon^ym^ou^s sources ’ information w%as confirmed to Yl?e by the Chair of the Defence Committee, Ilkka Kanerva (Na)tional Coal>iti>o>n).
According t+o Kanerva, t$he Defence Force|s and the Security Police visited t{he Defen-ce and the Foreign Ri_ghts Committees to tell about the ongoing investigation.
This is p%rima%ri%ly considered as fin@a@nc@ia@l crime.
They were rather strict about not speculating abou@t an,y,t,hing els-e, Kanerva commented i}n the Yle interview.
According to Yle infor%mat%io%n, the at&tach&ed material so far h$as no-t shown any connection to national security, but the investiga~tion is jus!t beginning.
We hav@e no way of knowing what might ye(t b&e re]vealed, one of Yle's interviewees stated.
The extensive house searches started a w\ee\k ago in the Turku archipelago and o(n mainland b{e{g the question about whether the i-n-ve-st-ig-ation i&s simply about financial cri=me or i]f it h!as something to do with Finnish internal security.

And su~rely Liverpool manager J&ürge&n Klopp had the same i^dea when coming to West Lond;on.
T@he Reds had started t[he Leag{ue with six consecutive wins.
Liverpool had a stronger star{t, a]nd especially Virgil van Dijk seemed to control h]is end of th[e fie%ld alone.
A|s f[o[r Chelsea, on Wed|nesd|ay they won a fine Football L=e=ague Cup away win on Anfield Road.
Then Eden Haz\ard came o"ff the bench t*o decide the match with a beautiful indi'vi'dual performance.
Obviously no.w Hazard wa?s playing from th@e very first minutes.
On t.h.e 25th minute h$e first pl@aye@d a tight triangle with Mateo Kovacic a-n-d Jorginho.
Fin+ally the Croatian sa;w Ha#zard rushing forward an{d sent him a perfectly balanced through ball.
Hazard strayed a bit to the edge of the pe.nal.ty b~ox, but from there managed to sweep a perfect left-footed voll;ey i]n to the lo!wer c/o/rner.
Pool's Brasilian goalie Alisson was a bit slow with h_is save and only managed t)o tou=ch the bal`l with his finger@tips.
Klopp m@u@st have felt the losing position be(ing slightly u=nfai=r, since almost r*i*g*h*t after Antonio Rüdiger c=l=e=a=red M#o Salah's shot from the goal line.
In the s"eco"nd half, also Chelsea keeper Kepa s,aw some serious acti&o&n.
Basque goal<i<e had a quick r&eac&tion t:o Sad,io Ma>n>é ’ s shot, and pushed the b.all from the foot of the goal post to a corner kick.
As for the oth_er end, Alisson resetted Hazard's fast break wit*h hi@s d!ive.
The gue*sts ’ best chance came on the 72nd minute, as James Milner's crossing fo|und B}obby Fir`mino.
However, the star Brazilian's header wa`s directed tow{ards his national tea.m m<a<te David Luiz, which saved the hom:e team's lead.
Even that did n'*t ho,l,d anymore o]n t=he 89th minute, when substitute Daniel Sturridge had a free s]ho]t from 25 metres.
Sturridge was playing on his old home stad(ium, an~d to honour that, the forw&ard th(rew a powerful shot in the upper co-rne-r.
Liverpool '[s winning start of the L'eague came to an e.nd with the 1-1 draw, b;ut it still holds the top posit&ion - together with Manchester C~it~y.
Chelsea is also still go;ing for the championship with only two points fro^m th%e t}op.
D@i@s@c@us@sion about clock switching divides the p,eop,le
I remember some decades a>go a n_ewsp_aper a\sking severa)l Finnish influential persons what divides Finnish people.
O}n}ly response I remember was Juice Leskinen ’ s: ‘ N:en ’ end(ing.
Some sur\na\mes have a ‘ nen ’ endin"g, some d:o not.
Di@v@id@ing lines can sp=r=ing up anywhere, and thi`s was one of the p;ossi;b;le reasons.
In EU, Finland has achi<e<v<e<d t&hat th#is annual clock changing is about to become hi|story.
Many agree that switching c^l^o^c^ks twice annually has been simply fooler[y, a;nd that it has caused many pr\oblems.
In the end, thi*s achievement seems to b|e the easies,t part of the solution, even though it has n\o\t been th=at easy.
The most difficult part n_ow is to choose the ul/tim/a/t/e time: current summer o=r win{ter time, or some other time zo_ne.
The people c~an also have their say o(n otakantaa.fi si]t]e.
Th>e on|lin|e survey has been o"pened by the Ministry of Tr'anspor't and Communications, and it will be open until Friday 1|2 October.
Discussions are he=at=ed both around cof+fee tables a$n$d in social m*ed*ia, and everyone has something to say about the mat<ter.
Those favour|ing winter time ju`stify their opinion with the effects of morning s;unlig;h;t to peoples ’ well-being, and those d,efending summer t/ime with the effects of eveni]ng l}ight on peoples ’ will to spend t<ime outside and th]at way to their well-being.
Bot*h sides have solid supporters an!d good arguments.
According to research, morning light sets the pace f.or a person ’ s d+a+y and increas*es e&ne&rg&y levels.
On the othe+r hand, if a perso-n does not particularly su:ffer from waking u$p when it ’ s dar_k, light increases the time p}e}opl}e spend outside and better e.nables for example aut?umn yard work.
Th,e amount of extra light hours after a normal wor/k da=y h\as already been calculated.
I w!o!uld rather take both, bu&t it ’ s unlucky t[h[a[t w[e cannot help our location i^n the nort^hern corner of the Earth.
Th"e wi]n]t]ers are anyway too dark, the summers t:oo light for many people.
It i<s typical for di?scussio?ns about this matter t-o support one ’ s own views and oppose the other side ve+r+y uncompr#omis#ing#ly.
There is no need t=o listen to the justifications o(f t[he opposing s(ide, since the most important thi-ng i"s how one feels about the matter.
Si;n;ce almost everyone has a\n opinion about th:is matter, i[t is somewhat pointless to try t=o change someone ’ s mind.
I't i$s effort well wasted.
It is easy to have an argument abo|ut this topic, since it does not require to really go into d&etails, a-nd a.n op]in]io]n is just-i-ficati-on enough.
These kinds of topi#cs are generally those, who incite most fur+ious, and m~ost futile, d`e`ba`te.
Obviously it will be annoying if a wro@ng opti+on is chosen, bu]t we will s\ure\ly reconcile ourselves with i~t.
And, should life feel to,o glum, it alw>ay>s offers a suita>ble scapegoat.
J?osba foug?ht a narrow away win
Josba '-s fir"st aw"ay game in floorball Fi$rst Division against Nurmo ’ s Jymy res^ulted in full three league points.
Jo`s`ba return'ed ho:me from Seinäjoki with a triumph/ant 6-5 (3-1, 0-3, 3-1) victory.
In the beginning of the third period, Nu:rmo was s!till a goal a!h!ead, b{ut Josba experimented with line-ups an]d rotated players.
I$n 50.47, brothers Eetu an\d Juuso Lehtiniemi plotted the 6;-5 winning goal.
A(s both t"eams got penalties, many c^r^u^c^ia^l minutes were played with even strength.
The m`ost eff,ecti,ve Josba player was Juuso Lehtiniemi (2+<1).
The secon*d cha\i\n had a good firepo'wer anyway, as Teemu Tuhkanen (1+1), Jere Kaartine-n (1+0) and Jere Kettunen (1@+0) al_l scored.
Also Miika Kosonen (1+0) play,ed in the s,econd chain whe:n he scored.
After three league ro=und=s, Josba has s;ix points.
The next oppone^nt is O2-Jyväskylä i_n an away match i{n two weeks.
Eno church celebrates its bicentenary o_n Sund.ay
Eno church bicentenary i>s celebrated t$omo$rrow o$n Su%nday, for some part in a very sad atmosphere.
Kiihtelysvaara church arson a week a>go was a sho;ck.
Also Eno church was gu{arded o?n the two nights after the f}ir}e.
Despite the p~a~in, today i=s a day of celebr[at[io[n.
E,v,en i]f noone would want i[t t]o be so, Eno church is now the oldest church in the Joensu&u parish union.
T,he c\h\urc\h on a hill in the centre of t?he village has always been the h}ea}rt of En"o, despite all s>or>ts of municipal and other mergers.
A family service beg/ins at Eno church a!t 10 o ’ clock to#day.
After t@hat, a Karelian banquet tabl}e i+s set at the church hall.
There is a lot of different things happen?in?g during the d]a]y, both in<s<id<e a~nd out.
It is possible for example to v;isi;t the church building gu)id)ed by retired sacristan o|f 37 y|ears, A+ri Räsänen.
Church bir=th celebration also i`s an end o@f an era.
The church hall, built in 1*98*2 an(d already taken ou[t of use, wi%ll keep its doors open for t;he last time today.
Currently we h"ave temporary fac)ili)ties at the old municipal ha`ll, chaplain Markku K@o@stin@e@n says.
The church h<all was destro#y#ed by indoor air p[rob[lems, but the ch^ur^ch h_a_s been healthy in place for already 200 years.
Elon M}u}sk steps do<wn as ch+airma+n of the board for Tesla - Fraud c<harges settled with $40 million
Electric c)ar manufacturer Tesla and the company ’ s CEO Elo'n Musk have settled their cas)e with the Securi|ties and Ex>chan>ge Commission SEC, w)h)o regulate the U.S. secu~r~itie~s industry.
SEC sus+pected Mu(sk t.o be guil't'y of a securities fraud, and Musk was in danger to be removed from t+he man\ag\ement of the company he founded.
However, Mu!sk is allowed to con=tinue as Tesl@a CEO.
Instead, Musk has to step dow&n f-or three years as c$h$ai$r$man of t`he board for Tesla.
T^he co>m>pany has to hire an outside chairman.
Mu*sk will als_o be under stricter supervision.
According to the s,ettlement, T-e-sla will have t$o appoint two independent d[ir[ectors and oversee M[usk ’ s communications in the future.
I@n addition, both Tesla and Mu?sk h=av=e to pay $20 million (ca . 17 million euro) to s,e,ttl,e t{he case.
‘ The resolution is intended to pr|e|v|en|t further market disruption and h.arm t+o Tesla ’ s shareholders ’, say,s S^EC co-director Steven Peikin.
T|he case beg=an in August, when Musk tweeted t!hat he could t+ake Tesla private.
He also wrote that fund@i@ng has bee`n secured.
This twee>t c/aused Tesla ’ s stock pr>ice to rise temporarily.
SEC suspected Musk guilty o}f a securities fr+a+ud.
According to SEC, the tweet was false and misle`ading, an,d Mu_sk had not discussed the dea"l with the company ’ s other dir$e$ct$o$r$s o!r potential financing partners.
In practice, SEC charged Musk wit=h misleading t^he invest-ors.
On Fri$d$a$y, SEC announced it is going to su:e the company and Mu=s=k.
SEC t#ol#d i`t is seeking to impose fines on Musk and t,o ban him f.r.o.m being able to hold officer o:r director pos{itio{n{s at publicly-traded companies.
SEC ’ s summons scared the i~nvest~ors, and Tes@la's share too$k a nosed@iv@e.
Ov@er 800 pe<op<le died in an earthquake and tsunami i&n Indonesia
T\he death toll from Indonesia's quak-e an?d t,suna,m,i dis}aster has soared to at least 832, th!e disaster agency said according to news agency AFP.
The number of death.s is believed to grow hig`her, since the investigation o/f damages is till on<go<ing.
Vice President Jusuf Kalla predicts t}he de'ath toll cou[ld reach into the thousands.
An eart}h}quake on Frida(y triggered a t+sunami that surged over th%e Palu city in the island of Sulawesi.
A warning about a tsunami was issued r;ight after the qua}k}e, but it w!as qui$ckly cancelled.
According to official^s, ne:a:rly all the known deaths ar|e a$t least so far from Palu.
The rescue officials ar,e wo<rri<ed about th<e Donggala area close to the quake centre, where the situation is for t=he mo(st part unclear.
Already now several pe[ople are kno?wn to have died.
Cries o%f he;lp from the ruins
T[he Indonesian army h>as be~en called to aid the rescu>e workers in searching for victims.
President J-oko Widodon, who arrived in the destruction area today, asked the troops to b_e read-y to work d:ay a&n&d night.
One of the focu$s points of the rescue work is a Palu hotel, t~h~e rui(ns of w\h\ich are suspected to sti~l~l hold 5%0 to 60 people.
Muhammad Syaugi, head of th#e na*tion*al Search and Rescue Agency managi^ng t-h-e rescu(e work, sa.id that one people has been pulled o%ut alive from the ruins of Roa-Roa hot&el, popular with business travellers.
W,e a~lso heard people calling for help, he sa_id.
Syaugi said heavy lifting equipment i"s n(ow quickly needed i,n the quake and tsunami ar!ea.
Many Indonesians have turned to Facebook and other social media i`n order to find th/e/ir m#i#s#sing family an|d friends.
Help, you i$n Palu a@nd nearby.
M;y friend ’ s family members a)r)e still missing, one o|f the writers pleaded in a Facebook gro{up.
Politicians ’ phone numbers leake^d t}o troublemakers in Britain
Many B{r{itish politicians were subjected to n+uisa+nc+e a#fter their personal details were leaked because o`f an app security flaw.
T#h#e troublemakers had acce?ss to e.g . Mi;ni;st;e;rs ’ phone numbers.
T'he ap%p in question w'as a mobile application used f}o}r Britain ’ s Conservatives ’ party conference.
Fo*r exa/m/ple Brexiteers Michael Gove, Secretary for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, and former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson were a@mon@g t$hose targeted f`or dist'urba'nc'e.
Sever*al min~isters received nuisance calls.
Because of a security flaw, m=em=b=ers of the public were a:ble to acc|ess the poli]tician]s profiles in the Conser]vative party annual co\nfere\nce ’ s mobile application.
They could enter the profil|es using a poli{tician ’ s email address, which i{s w)id)ely available online.
Th@e person entering a profile could view and edit the data s}tored with?in.
For a brief moment, someone manage[d to swap Boris Johnson's p]rofile picture f:or po@rnograp@hy and change h+is job t>i>t>le to a libellous one.
Michael Gov$e ’ s picture was changed to one of media tycoo<n Rup^ert Murdoch.
Dawn Foster, a c^ol^umnist for The Guardian described the problem by writing that the conference app a%llows one t:o log i;n as other people with t^h^eir email a%dd%ress.
After t<hat it is possible t!o view the contact detail>s in a person ’ s pr_ofile and, for exa>mpl>e, s`end messages as them.
The co'nfere'nce app essentially made every jou<rnalist, politician a%nd attendee ’ s mobi_le number public, Foster criticised.
A Conservative par/ty spokesperson apologised for t$he breach.

T\he Wall Finland quiz show's audience has a hu,ge number of appl\a\u\ding P&oles every week
The sharp-eyed viewers p{aid attention to the studio audience re\a\ctio\n\s i}n T_he Wall Finland quiz show.
The America!n television f#o#rm#at The Wall ha?s spread qui(ckl(y worldwide, and its Finnish version arrived at channel Nelonen last Sat`urday.
Hosted b{y Hei<k<ki Paasonen, the game show has been filmed in Poland in the same studio, whe]re the o.ther international productions o_f the format are mad@e.
T@he shooting possibilities of the studio i[n Poland are exceptional, because th\e format's tall, 12-metre gam#e wall requires a generous spac:e.
During the opening episode, social media highlighted the show's studi%o audien?c?e, w!hich peo-ple guessed to b}e Polish.
There w-a-s a T|wi|tter disc&ussion about whether t!he possible Poles sitting in the studio understand anything about the game played in Finni@sh.
Unne Sormunen, ma:nagin:g director of Fin&nish programmes a:t Nelonen, explains the issue t)o Iltalehti.
She says the st:udio audience consists o?f th)e players ’ close friends, other Finns, expatriate Finns living i;n Po?l?an?d, and P)olish viewers.
The Finnish production audi!en!ce co'ns'ists of international applauders, just like the a'ud'ie'nces of other countries ’ T(he Wall episodes, filmed in th"e same production spa;ce.
Fi$nald a;lso has these groups, the so-called p%rofess%io%nal audiences th~a~t visit different programmes ’ shoots, Sormunen explaines.
She reminds people that following the game is not s^o difficult t%o understand, even if one does not unders,tand the langu@age it is p)laye)d i!n.
I!t i:s easy to separate the red and green balls falling fro/m the wall.
Howeve'r, ther>e are interpreters presen[t i)n the studio to translate for those speaking a foreign language.
There are t\wo interpreters who interpret simultaneously everything t;ha;t ha$p$pens to the studio f+loor manager.
The manager then g_i_ves i/nstruct/io/ns to the audience and describes f*or example wh+at kinds of jokes people are telling a$nd wh:at is the current situation, Sormunen says.
She compares the situ&ation wit$h how things were don<e re^centl^y with David Hasselhoff in a Finnish production.
Som]e years a*go, David Hasselhoff was involved i)n Talent Finland fi<lmi<ng here in Finland.
He had a c+ontin+uous simultaneous interpretation coming t&o his earbud the whole time, and h;e kne'w everything that w[as said in Finnish, Sormunen summari@ses.
A typhoon tha,t batte{red the southe'r'n p&arts of Japan proceeds towards the mai{n islands - official warn about landslides and flooding
Officials also warn ab(out p%o%ssible landslides and flooding.
At least 50 people hav<e been in=jured in t@y@ph@oo@n Trami, bu't the off$ic$ial say there have been no major injuries and th\er\e is no information so far a>bout fatalities.
I/n the southern is/land o"f Okinawa, the winds were so strong they upended c<ars.
According to Japan B@r@oadcas@tin@g Corporation people have been evacuated t~o shelters, an~d there a(re ove=r 300,000 households without electricity.
Over a thousand flights h{a{ve bee=n c|ancelled, and high-speed trains have in pla"ces come to a sta@n@dstil@l because of the storm.
The storm i[s ecpected to hit near O>saka a}r}ound noon Finnish time.
The capital Tok`y`o is no/t directly on the path of th`e st<orm, but strong w^inds and rain have been promised there, too.
Trains have been cancelled i.n T(okyo today.
According t-o meteo.rolog.ist, Trami w-ill continue to torment Japan until Monday.
The sk$y gets even cloudier for Ä-ssät
The beginning o:f the season h?as been a b/ad one for Ässät.
The situation i(s alrea+dy al>most pitch black, as the team lost t*o Vaasa Sport on their hom.e grou?nd b@y 3 goals . The final score was 3-6 (0-2, 0-'3, 3-1).
T@he P[ori team now has h"ad five consecutive losses, and a point total of two from s$ix games.
None of t%h%e defensemen or p;layers fr>om two lower strings of the team has made a go-al.
And t'he pressure ke%ep%s building.
When playing against S$p$or$t, the c$ro$wd$s started to leave t`h`e hockey arena already when t[he[re wa{s still about half of the game left.
We ’ ve only play@ed six games, and th$er$e ’ s n{o reason to gi{v{e up.
W$e have to be worried though, since our game wa+s t#ha#t bad.
Especial'ly per-forman-ce during sec^o^n^d period was shamefully bad, describes Jarno Kärk[i, who made 1+2 points for Ässät.
Sport natural:ly enjoyed their vic%to%ry.
The team had a previous game on Friday, s@o th!at could h)ave had an effect on their pl{ayi{ng.
And ma>yb>e i,t di}d, but Ässät j}u}st didn ’ t manage to capitalise on it.
Bread day visito-r number co(ntinu(ed to grow
The mo}ther of Bread Day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, marvels at the atten=d=an=ce i,n the bi~g hall's auditorium.
Somehow I thought there would perhaps n|ot be t&ha&t many people this year, Hyvärinen thought i~n t(he morning.
In t<he autumn of 2017, Bread Day was organised at the same ti'me wit[h Finnish plowing contest, so maybe t'he expectation was t>h>at the attendance c=o=u=ld ev*en go down f"rom the year before.
But unlike expectations, the aisles we,re crowded already before ten, the sellers sai)d t|he|ir products were so-ld o_ut, new c(rop porridge was sol@d more than last year, nearly 500 portions, an%d Hyvärin~en heard there had also been a rise in the numbe~r of cars.
The attenda]nce e~stim~ate has been about 6,000, Hyvärinen says later in the af"te"rnoo"n.
Dur[ing t;h;e five hours in t(he morning and afternoon, the programme had espe@ci@a@l@ly many things for families with child*re*n, which probably w~as th<e reason why there was a record number of them pre!s!ent.
Hyvärinen also est~imated the event reaches p=eo=ple fr{om even further distances.
Every year, the sellers also co+me to Lip&eri from a larger a-re-a.
This year, there were nearly a hu<n<dre<d sal]es represen/tatives, handicraft, pastry, and harvest product sellers i<n t\he bread parish.
The moth-er of Bread Day, Pirkko Hyvärinen, ma?rv?els at the attendance from th>e hall auditoriu<m.
The Bread Day beg=a=n with a harvest blessin(g.

7 mo^s^t beautiful lights - th]is is how yo)u recognise a good lamp
Bring the spac#e to life, create a_n appropriate a^tmosphe^re to the decor, a%nd read a book without tiring your eye[s.
It is wort!h!whi!l!e to i[nv[est in good lighting.
We collected thre|e good reasons t%o investi in lighting.
The tips c>ame from Innolux D@irect@or of Sales an"d Marketing Tarja Jokiniemi.
Do a favour t+o y*our eyes
The importance of lighting g"rows together wit*h age.
Sufficient light can help in those probl<em<s many peop{le get w&hen they age, a[s visual acuity decreases a,nd more and mo*r*e suffer from glares.
A~s one gets older, also th$e need for l\ig\ht grows.
A person in their sixties requires three t-imes t|he light t|h|an a pe.r.son in their twenties.
It i]s worthw'hile investing in the therapeutic effects of l/igh/t and in lamp qualities already for heal|th reasons.
A go#o#d l^a^mp gives enough light but d`oesn't caus_e glares, Jokiniemi gives tips.
Create beaut*y around you
A beautiful decor is brought out on)ly with suit+ab+l+e li%ght solutions.
Modern home decorator ha;s plenty to ch<oose from.
A subdued japandi style combini:ng Scandinavian and J/apanes/e th,i,ngs is currently popular.
On the o>ther h=and, also the modern and playful retro style d_r_awi_n_g inspiration fr}o}m the 70s has had a boom i(n popul(arit(y, with its diffe?rent metallic tones and icecream colours.
Authenticity ch%arms i{n the s$a$me way it does in other house decor.
The materials no>w in:clud:e wood, concrete, ceramics, paper, leat/her, and bam;b;oo.
Express your personali,ty
People invest in the`ir homes much m!o!re than before, and decor has beca}m}e a w*ay to express o)ne ’ s personality.
In*s*tead of mass pro|ducti|on, people want to have a tail/ored, even a b|old lamp that ha;s a story to tell.
People are clearly lo{oking f>or Finnish and Nord[i[c products with a well-known origin an{d designer.
They are very desig>n->aware, Jokiniemi s~ays.
One does not necessarily bu_y th^e m;ost recent trendy lamp to one ’ s hom>e, but rather a timeless c}l}assic one has saved many y/ea/rs for.
Certain kinds o?f timeless, jewel-like, elegant classics h?a?ng on from year t"o ye!ar, Jokiniemi says.
Thanks and goodb:ye!
KooKoo showed the door t[o t%he%ir Canadian forward afte^r three matches
The ways part!ed f=or Ko)oKoo and forward Brendan O ’ Donnell.
T)he Canadian forward wore or)ang)e and black f_or a total of three Liiga matches wit@hout points, KooKoo ’ s pre?ss release says.
O ’ Donnell transferred to K(ooKoo i&n Augus%t with a one year contract inclu>ding a trial period until th"e end of September.
Dur/ing the last season, the 26-year-old f?or?ward played in KHL team K/unlund Re%d Star and in KHL farm le-ague VHL in KRS Heilongjiang.

Pelimies wan=ts to show example i.n recy=cl=ing - the merch>a>nd>ise is shipped in recycled boxes, plastic gave way t*o paper
Pelimies, a sho*p specialising i}n game;s, nowadays recycles not only games but also packaging mat}er}ials.
Brick and mortar shop customers ’ items are no longer packed i.n p{la{stic bags, but in paper ba\gs ma{d{e from recycled mate-rial.
Items purchased via w=eb store are packed for example i(n packaging that has com<e fro-m the importers.
All the arriving packages a^re reus%ed.
W-e may use t&he boxes about t/en time*s, as long as the package is in usable condition, Ville P,uuru,la from Pelimies Oul<u says.
As p"ad"di"n"g material, the company mainly uses newspapers and other lik-e r|ecycle|d material.
We avoid bubble w~ra~p a*s much as possible.
In the near future we p@l@an t;o switch over to re#cycled m]aterial also with envelopes.
T\he company wants to b#e an example f\or others, too.
According to Puurula, recycling causes n!o a@dditi@onal trouble.
It's not a bi|g problem t'o begin recycling.
I"t wil~l also bring savings, when for example pasteboard packages a=r=e reused.
Recycling fits naturally i,n Pelimies ’ operations, because i`n add'iti'on to new products, the shop ')s primary range of products i}n}c}l}ude f{or example secondhand games and devices.

Russian intelligence se#rvices ’ sabotage activities have a lo}ng tradition
There i`s no reason to suppose tha%t the Foreign In\tell\ig\ence Service o)f the Russian Federation (SVR) or The Main Directorate of the General Staff o\f the Armed Forces o&f th{e Russian Federation (GRU) would have aban/d/oned this m|od|e of operation.
During Soviet tim[es, so called DRG grou}ps sp"e"cialise"d in sabotage activities.
The n{am{e comes from Russian words diversionno-razvedyvatelnaja gruppa: sabotage a;n;d intelligen.ce group.
Th=e agents of S"o"viet security service KGB wo%rking in western countries prepared d[etailed plans f%or important sab.ot.a.ge targets, says KGB archivist Vasili Mitrokhin (1922-2004) w]ho defected to the West.
His information was published i'n Christopher Andrew ’ s books i}n the late 1990s and in th]e beginning o#f 21st ce$n$tury.
Among others, the targets included harbo@urs, s|h|ipyards, big d'ams, oil refineries, and gas pi_pe c#onne#ction#s.
I~n Germany, KGB acquired Bunderswehr, railroad, gamekeeper, and road worker unif^orm^s and accessories t[o b}e used b;y DR$G groups in cover operations.
This trick was used by Russian paratroopers in the Crimea in Fe]bruary 20`14; they d^ress^ed in local Ukrainian riot poli=ce's gear, set u*p c>hec>kpoints o$n the roads leading from pe\nin\sula to Ukraine, and sealed Crimea off from its m{other country.
During th~e c.old war, a:gents hid equipment packages with mines, expl}osi}ves, detonators, a=nd communication devices in the ground for sabotage gr-oups.
A"s lat<e as in 1998, a KGB cache wa;s found in Switzerland, and when officials spray|ed i>t w&i&th a water cannon, its booby-trap detonated.
Police caught four dr:ink-drivers in th^e region during the night

In th[e Outo`ku`mpu centre a 20-year-old out-of-town man drivi\ng a passenger car blew 1.33 pe]r mille.
T'he p;olic;e suspects these male drive/rs of drunken driving and the P@o@l@vijä@rvi driver additionally of aggravated e@nd@anger@ing of traffic safety.

True s>tory o<n TV today: A climber l`eft to die twice
Am,erican Beck Wathers wrote a bo{ok 18 years ago.
Left for Dead: My Journey Home Fro>m Everest is ba+sed on the man '\s own ex+perien+ce+s.
Tonight ’ s movie i=s based on th+e+m.
Everest has its premiere i#n Finnish TV n+ow.
In May 199_6, climbers o:n Moun]t Everest were overtaken by a disastrous snowstorm.
Baltasar Kormákur ’ s 2015 direction tells about t^he fight for surv/iv/al that has been c#ove#red plenty o+f times.
There have bee@n pre%vious films - and documents - about the tra@g@e@dy.
The real events are looked throu=g=h al+so in t+h+is article.
2^2 y[ears ago, the world's highest mou{nta{in took the lives o@f eight climbers.
Two of them were experienced expedition leaders: Scott F(ischer an+d Rob H>al>l.
It was precisely Ha[l[l, who was W~eat~hers ’ g:uide.
An eye surge,r,y performed just be%fore his depar%ture to Nepal mi/gh/t have saved Weathers ’ life.
B?ecaus?e of that and the air pressure, he lost his e&ye sight, which mea}nt he had t^o pass the clim-b t+o the summit.
Rob Hall continued t@o climb an[d didn ’ t retu]rn.
H}oweve}r, Weathers ’ life-and-death stru!ggle had only j-us-t begun.
As the storm bl*ew up, he got lost a~nd didn ’ t find his way back t^o t:he c<amp.
Wh_en people came to look fo+r the man, they found him i$n such a ba[d condition tha(t they did;n ’ t believe he would survive.
Weathe^rs was left t{o die.
As if by a miracle, he still m*an*ag*ed to f!in!d her feet and find t-he oth+er+s.
Weather)s was badly frostbitten, s=o they still though he was dying, and on&ce again he was lef%t t-o his own devices.
It is obvious t;hat against a:ll expectations, Beck Weathers sur_vived.
At some point, also his f@ell@ow climbers began t]o believe in his chan|ce|s to such a=n extent they h~elp~ed him.
T@h@e film features J!o!s!h Brolin as Beck Weathers,
Jason Clarke as Rob Hal[l, an|d Jake Gyllenhaal as Scott F*ishe*r.
Other roles feature fo$r ex-a-mple Robi/n Wright, Keira Knightley, and Emily Watson.
Eno chu.r.ch bice=ntena=ry has been celebrated today
The 200-year-old ch%urch o[f E?no has been celebrated within the church precinct today.
The church was opened on 4th October 1818, an~d t>o celebrate the anniversary, a celebration f/or th=e who|le family was organised on Sun^da^y.
At then o ’ clo$ck t;he cel_e_brat_ion began with@i@n the church p&recinc&t with a family service, after which a Karelian banquet table was set at Eno church h|all.
T[he church was full.
517 people too%k part in t<he family service.
Eno vic"ar Armi Rautavuori was happy that people showed u[p in th(e church in s`uch great numbers.
It will be a gr~eat j^oy fo_r a long time yet a`n`d gives energy f:or my wor[k, Rautavuori (in the picture) says.
The Kiihtelysvaara chur]ch fire has resonated with m?an?y, and it w>as not ignored in the Eno c=hurch bice.nt.e.n.ar.y celebration.
Eno chur_ch i@s now the oldest among Joensuu Evangelic Lutheran p:ari:s:hes after Kiihtelysvaara c/hur/c/h was destroyed in a fire.
Kiihtelysvaara w=ood=en church was completed i+n 1770.
A prayer meeting was organised at Kiihtelysvaara i<n th.e morning, w/here the people calme.d down an_d reminisced the church that was destr=oy=ed in a fire.
Pictures and videos: A medi~can~e fl#ashe#d its pow?ers in Greece - the sea disappeared a@nd a stree|t turned into a river
A s.trong, hurricane-type autumn storm rolled t*o Greece from the s&out&hwe&st on Saturday.
A Medit#err#anea#n hurricane, a medic]ane, h[as been named Zorba.
The Hellenic National M-et-e-orolo-gica-l Service issued a red weather warning to are_a_s of Attica, P-el-opon-n-esus, the Ionian Isl'ands, th?e Cyclades, a>nd Crete.
Pictures taken f~ro~m the ar(e(a show a l<ot of flooding all around Greece.
A video published on Twitter shows, how, i?n?ste?ad of a s/treet, a river caused by flooding sudd`enl`y appeared betwe:en ho!uses in the town o!f Kiato located in Co*r*inth*ia.
Anoth$er video shows a car being carried b|y floodwaters.
In the southern par/t of Peloponnesus peninsula a strong wind caused r_ough sea;s.
The Finnish Embassy in Athens instruct^ed people on i&t&s Facebook page to p,rep,are for a storm i_n Greece.
The embassy urges people t~o f-ollow weat(her forecasts and local officials ’ instructions.
A mediterranian hurricane, also known as a me\d\ic\ane, brings about torre!ntial rains a/nd even a thr}eat of f?looding.
C;NN reports that according t+o a study published i+n 201.1, only about 1-2 medicanes occur per year, typically during the months o{f Septe^mber and Oc+tob+er, whe+n sea surface temperatures are still quite warm.
The c;urrent storm triggered flash flo^odi^n^g across T-unisia and Libya before moving north over t*he Mediterranean towards Europe.
A cau]s]e for c;oncer;n in Greece are t@he ref)ugee camps on islands, like on Lesbos.
The thousands of Syrian and Ir-aqi refugees living in the cam!ps have limited possibil"i"t"ies of finding prope/r protection.
Also the areas destr~oyed b(y last summer's wildfires near Athens are unde\r threat.
A medicane raged i+n Gr(ee(ce also in last November.
No going offshore, the flights sti$l$l on schedule - ther+e are currently thou|sa|nds of Finns holidaying in the Gre|ek islands t.hreate.ned by an autumn ga%le.
All offshor\e tours ar;e cancelled, an<d one sh_ould be caref]ul also when walking, so that branches or other loos"e objects flying in the storm d}o not hit one.
During the weekend, the guides distributed these ki#nds o;f in{s{t{r{uctio{ns for t'he about 3,500 Finns holidaying in Greek vi>a Aurinkomatkat.
The instructions ar:e needed, bec(ause ac&cording t&o the forecast, it is possible that the Zorba storm batterin#g the G>reek islands this weekend can reach even a hu,rricane level.
For exam?ple, near the island of C?rete, t<he wind velo"city in gusts can rise even up to 45 metres p~er second.
The rottenness of the weathe&r is made worse by t:o:rr:en:ti:al ra\ins.
According t%o tour operators, all the p[eople who have g-iven their phone numbers and have travelled with Aurinkomatkat and T_u_i from Finland t$o Greece, have b/een warned about the s+t+rong winds with a text messag\e.
Still sunny and wa]rm
According t(o Aurinkomatkat Deputy Communications Ma%nager Inka Ikonen, by Saturday early ev#ening, the h^oliday reso%r%ts have managed to avoid the worst.
For example, the fl|ights have landed a%nd t}o}ok off according to normal schedule.
Nat<u<ral<ly we are cons&ta&nt&ly following the situation.
Safety com}es first.
Tui ’ s Emergency Phone D|uty Officer Antonia Schroderus says a]lso t~h~eir flights have r[an on schedule.
We are constantly in con{t{act with our staff i.n the resor<t.
It was sti|l|l peaceful at least i)n C>rete, s;h;e said early on Saturday evening.
Tui has cur~rentl~y a little over 1,5\00 Finnish travellers loc=ate=d in t&h&e most popular G;r;e;ek islands, Rhodes and Crete.
Additiona\l\ly, there ar-e some a few hundred travellers staying in smaller lo/ca/tions.
For example, the worst stor-m will mo#st likely reach th^e island of Kos on Sunday morn}ing.
At the same time, Rhodes even saw a bit of s*un on Satur@da@y afternoon, and the te+mper+ature r,ose to 2?7 degrees, says Ikonen fro|m Aurinkomatkat.
It is estima-t-ed that Zorba will continue to tro_u_ble Turkey next, eve]n tho[ugh it will be slig~h~tly eased off.
T*o prepare for this, we hav+e already c\ont\acted our staff in Turkey, and for example checked the number of Fin;ns w`ho have f^lown to Antalya with Tui, Schroderus say+s.
Shirly Karvinen and Janni Hussi wore the exact s|ame evening gown fo)r the beauty contest fina{l - this i{s how t,hey reacted
A media personality and fitn?ess beauty Ja]nni Hu-ssi arrived at Miss Finland fin!al o;n Saturday wearing a low-backed evening dress.
Hussi say}s sh@e got the dress from Meslew.
I went t~o th+e shop and decided to tr`us`t the professionals, who did f?ind me an absolutely gorgeous dress for t<o<night, H(ussi smiles.
Host Shirly Karvinen had chosen to wear the exac=t s[a[m[e silver=y evening dress.
The pair themselves noticed thei^r matching outfits and rea:cte:d with lau&g&hter.
Karvinen told Ilta-Sanomat her preparations w+e+re hur#ried, an.d she had to get re+ad+y in an aeroplane.
Hussi was a backstage and red carpe[t host i?n the contest fi|nal, and s,he interviews the arriving fron|t row stars.
Hussi ha,s a recent m'ov'e behind her, s}i}n}c}e she moved t$o Jätkäsaari from Kamppi on Friday.
For t"he time being I ’ m going to s]tay there, w.e ’ l?l see what happens.
The essential thing i;s tha-t the new f;la;t has a separate study, Hossi reflec}ts.
Bef}ore the move, Hus{si holidayed alone in Greece.
I&t was lovely, I was at the hotel f!or a week without go#ing any.where.
A!s my stress eas_ed I g^ot a co>ld, but otherwise the holiday was really successful, Hussi says.
Shirly Ka+rvine+n ’ s aeorplane behaviour attracted a l.o.t o;f attention - the pensioners ’ cur@io@us eyes were on her
Host an?d Miss Finland 201:6 Shirly Karvinen told at t+he re-d carpet of Miss Finland fin#als that she has been busy with radio hosting and Love Isl?a?nd Finland shoots.
Karvi?nen has i>ndee>d been so busy she arrived t#o th}e final directly from a Finnair flight.
I did my hair and ma#ke-up i,n the aeroplane.
This is real g"la"mour.
I c;hange;d into m+y evening dress at home, Kar<vinen laughs.
Karvinen says she drew ou<t her makeup k|it surrounded by pens|ioners.
Her p/re/para/t/ions d]r]ew the fellow travelers ’ attention.
I had a big mir:ror and via the mirror I cou#ld see people lo#oking.
My makeup was amusing a.t least to ot&hers.
Karvinen flies t\o Spain onc"e a week.
S#he spends a few days a}t a time i*n Marbella.
Karvinen says she has enjoyed her work as host fo\r L+ov+e I(sland Finland.
She describes her expe\rience so far t'o have been also thoug}ht-provoking.
Karvinen says s$he said hel%lo to the sh*ow's singles on Friday.
Somehow it w]a]s rea"lly tough.
These are p:eopl:e's real f"eelings, Karvinen describes the show '~s singles ’ fee\l\ings.
How to wear over~-~th~e-knee b@oot@s?
Three p@erfe@c@t example outfits
Clas}sic clothe=s are garments that work from season to season, in any o(u(tf(it.
Often classics are decades old, bu~t sometimes ne&w&er items can c]ome along.
An autumn a&nd w@i@n@ter seasons ’ hit s$hoe a few years ago, over-the-knee boots are not goi!ng anywhere.
As the name de/scribes, boots coming u?p to above the knees repeat stylis-hly ye=a=r after year, season after s;eason.
Impressive boot@s divide the users ’ opinion#s, but you should b_e bold and try th$is, w%ell, bold style.
You see, over-the-?knee boots sui!t almost any kind of outf<it.
N]o matter whether it's denim, lace, tu=lle or tricot, the boots ’ si'm'pl'e le:ath:er or fa-ke leather surface works.
Long bo,o,ts look good both wi{th party lo)oks and with everyday outfits.
Black o"ve"r-the-"knee boots match even very soft outfi=ts.
They balance the femininity of a pi(nk, floral ple{a{te{d skirt and a so@ft, massive knit jus{t right.
A fresh but s\tylis\hl\y autumnal everyday outfit t&o suit a romantic tas&te.
A str!ong a\nd sligh:t:ly retro outfit i(s created with a long, copper brown velvet dress, over-the-knee boots, impressive ear,r,ings, and a studded s!m!al!l bag.
Ev-e-n though over-t|he-knee boots hav*e a ce]rt]a]in elegance, they are also a perfect match t(o a relaxed everyday out"fi"t, together with a t-shirt, long shorts, and a t%re%ndy cap.
Wonderfu%lly easy and y&et so stylish!
Tw*o robot cars t$o begin operation in Espoo
T,h,ey will operate the re?s?t of the year and take passe"nger"s, Espoo city r<eports.
Otaniemi robot cars act as a bus simulator, because the plan is t}o beg-in operation wit!h a robot bus i$n the ar$ea next s)pr)ing.
The project concerns developing an*d piloting a year-round rob&o&t vehi[cle traffic, and te}sting the vehicles technical functionali$ty in Finnish conditions.
The trial will investigate h}ow r"o"bot c%a%rs manage with the current street network.
At the same time, t?he city offers robot bu|s developers a possibility to develop th,e technology in a real env-i-ronment, Head o_f Traffic Management Johanna Nyberg s>ay>s.
This is the first time robot car<s operate completely automatically amo?ng other tra*ff*i*c without a%ny specific traffic arrangements.
The vehicle safety i_s on t,he re|spon|sibil|i|ty of a/n assisting passenger always aboard the vehicle.
T~h~e vehicles sense continuously sense their environment with many diff?erent sensors, evalua`tin`g if the road i-s unobstructed.
I@f it is n:o:t, they decipher whether the sensed obstruction is a vehicle, a bicycle, o}r for example a s!now flake, says Harri Santamala, C@E@O o'f Sensible 4, t#he company i\n c*har*ge of developing robot traffic.
The robot cars operate the w:hole autu+mn thre)e days a we=ek: on Tuesdays bet-ween 13 and 15.30, Wednesdays 10&-&15, and Thursdays 10-15.
The ro#bot cars have six stops during their route and they ta{ke pa'ssengers aboard.
The robot car st"ops can be recognised f~rom t}h}e stop markings.
The surest way t.o g>et aboard is from the stop num]ber 1 at Otakaari.

Police s^uper^vi^sed hu!nt!ing in North Karelia and Savolax
Eastern Finland Police Department carried out hunting supervision together with Metsähallitus a`nd Finnish Wil=d=life Agency in North Karelia and Savolax on Frida[y and S}a}turday, the h!unting contact persons o?f the poli;ce department said i|n social media on Saturday.
The main emphasis in supervision was the lega.lity and pe$r$missibility of hunti*ng.
Eac-h hunter's gam_e licence and hunting pe/rmit required on state land were checked.
In a+ddit+ion, th}e hunting g)un licences were checked, a%s well as cartridge n&umber of automatic weapons used in hunting game birds.
According to th]e police, 112 h?unte?r?s were checked during t{h{e supervisi+on, and only on hunter without a req&ui&site hunting permit was found.
The hun!ter w$as punished with 12 unit fines f>or illicit hunting.
T*he police also conducte!d b%re%ath tests o:n 133 drivers, and two of them are suspected of drink driving.
The patrols also handled f^i^v^e traffic infractions wit(h fine penal<ties, the police recapitulates.
In su<mmary, it c`an be concluded that hunt$ers observe hunt permissibility extremely well.
Many hunters we=re surprised by the sup,ervisio,n.
One hunter sta#ted ‘ I hav"e hunted in th^e area f\or 50 years, a^nd this w=as the first time someone checks the permits ’.
Eastern Finland Police Departmen`t continues hunting supervision together with ot:he:r supervision officials i_n th%e autumn.
Mykkänen t-ravels to Turkey to ob'se'rv'e the selection o)f Syrian quota refugees
Minister of the Int;eri;or K*ai Mykkänen (National Coalition) will travel to Turkey in the nex~t fe"w days to obse%rv%e the selection of q&uot&a refugees coming to Finland.
This year, it has be-en decided that Finland will receive 5~30 Syr^ia^n^s from Turki@s refugee camps.
Th\e selection t!r!ips a|re usually done a couple of times per year, with representatives from the Fin$n$ish Immigration Service, the M`i`nistr`y o!f Employment and the Economy, and the Polic)e.
Currently the delegat#ion is alr"ea"dy in Tu~rke~y, conducting interviews.
Th*e Un?i?ted Nations ’ High Commissioner for Refugees UN/HCR firs=t selects people who a]r]e in an especially vulnerable situation as candidates.
In practice, this means people who are considered to be i^n an ex_ceptio_nal distress, such a:s sing}le paren%t families, handicapped a,nd sick person-s, women and children.
There are more peop#le selected to the gro/up arriving in F'inla'nd than the quot`a requires, since in pract(ice some of them w(ill not arrive for different reasons.
While in Tu<rkey, Minister Mykkänen will al,so meet Tur`kis`h Minister of th'e Interior, Süleyman Soylu, and non-governmental organisations operating on t^he Sy[rian border.
Minister Mykkänen will be a"c"c"ompanied b(y Pe$rm$anen$t Secretary Ilkka Salmi.
Talk.s about additional quota
Finland has been adm?it?t?i?ng quot<a refugees since the 1970s.
In rece>nt years, the quota has bee"n 7&5&0 refugees per year.
For a cou}ple of years, the quota was 1,050 refugees pe\r year, but since then, t#he Gov*e*rnment ha-s not reached an agreement about an increas\e.
T'he National Coalition Party ha"s s}upporte}d the quota increase, but the last time, the idea was s[hut down by the Blue Re:for:m.
Prime M-in-ister Juha Sipilä (Centre) recently proposed t*he qu{o{ta to be increased gradu[ally to 1,500-2,000 people pe?r year.
Mykkä:n:e:n ’ s visit is the first on>e t(he Minister of the Interi_or makes to observe the selection of quota refugees during th"is t,erm of government.
The former Minis:ters o)f the Interior, Petteri O+rpo (National C>oalition) a-nd Paula Risikko (National Coalition), transferred to th<eir new tasks befor~e the visits could be arranged.
Finland receives a 10,000 e;uro subsidy for every r#efug#ee in an e{spec{i{all{y vulnerable situation.
Reall]y goin^g off t|he track now - it ’ s impossible to know whether to laugh or c'ry
L?a?st Satur[day Karjalainen reported on the legislative pr?op?osal to amend the Animal Welfare Act.
T+h+e article gives an idea that to start with, the proposal prohibits all such animals th'at have no;t been s`eparat`ely permitted wi&t&h a mi}n}isterial d$e$cree to be kept as farme*d a[nim[als, pets, or in other way related to business operations.
So to start with, e-ve-rything els}e is prohibited ex'c'e'pt the animals that are individually mentioned in t&h&e act.
If the proposal ends up as an act, this m}ost likely m^ean^s we are ab\and\on\i\ng a common principle i=n western democracies that an act separately forbids an action that endan^gers the s.afe.ty o,f society or good pract=ic=es.
Now the proposed provisions essentially forbid all su$c$h activities tha-t the act or decrees d(on't separately per[mi[t.
The change will result i:n a situation where nothing new can be tr=ied in fo$r example business, and no ot)her things ca[n be done befor\e an approving a:ct has been adopted o>r a decree issued.
Th.e g*overn*men*t ’ s actions in bill drafting i_n general have been weak.
If we now g!o down th!e road that leads t/o a Finland wh\ere everything i!s forbidden that is not separately pe)r)mitted, I don ’ t know any more whether to la"ugh or cry.
I don't do`u`bt that th~e An<i<mal Welfare Act needs an update.
But statute drafting in this directio!n is n-ot a part o,f democracy.
Unfortunately I don't know the Constitution al(l that we<ll, but I wonder whe@t@her it pe`rmit`s this kind of ‘ ever*y*t*hing i?s forbidden if it's no}t separately permitted in an act or a decree ’ pro?ce?dure.
I wish there would b"e a sensible m>inis>ter to stop the progression of statute dr$a$ftin$g of thi)s kind.
Metti Forssell gives a tip: The f`o`ur trendiest sk>irt>s of the a@utumn
The trend garment o'f this au(tumn comes with a snakeskin p`attern.
It looks remarkably good esp~ec~ially in sk:irt:s.
Pair a snakeskin s)kirt wi$th a s#ubdued top, like a turtleneck o:r a regular t-shirt, to keep th)e outfit stylish.
Th;is ye%ar there is a lot of s'ilk ou>t ther}e, a|nd a silk skirt especially is one of the season ’ s trendiest garments.
P_air a gorgeous si$lk skirt elegantly w]ith a feminine top or casually with a kn@it.
You can als]o b!e more playful with a silk skir't, and p(u(t on for example trainers or this au+tumn ’ s trend shoes, cowboy boo{t{s.
N|o matter whether it>s grey, brown o`r multicoloured, al$l check skirts are now part o>f every wom%an ’ s must have autumn clothes.
Be bold when combining different colours and pla@y w(it(h the che&ck pattern also by using tops of dif[ferent patterns.
For example a co#mb#ination o/f check and polkado{t patterns is beautiful.
Asym[metric[al hems are a b}rea}th of sum,mer ’ s lightness to t{ake along to autumn.
Asy^mmetrical hem is at the same tim<e both feminine and pl$a$yf$ul, and it f=i=ts perfectly both during weekdays and in a p'artie's.

Turkey recommends p]eople to charge the$i$r cell phones in case o:f a storm
T:he Zorba s}torm that bl/ew in Greece on Satur\day is expected to move to Turkey on Sunday.
On Saturday, the meteorologi~sts warned sailors, fish<ers, and f&arme&r&s especially in the west coast of t]he count!ry about the storm in Gr%eece, writes CNN Türk.
The tropical storm is rep#orted t_o move along t>he c<oast from south to north during the day.
Early Saturday evening, the disaster and emergency au_thorities recommended the citizens cha>rge their cell phones befo|r|e the storm and ensure the f:unctioning of their internet connection, s@o they c,a,n r/e/cei/ve u+p-to-d+at+e information, says loca^l news agency Anadolu Ajansi.
The people are warned to stay a=t home a;nd away fro:m the windows, and move for example g#ar#den furniture away fr-om the wind.
Turkey is expected to recei<ve torrential rain with w}i}n}d velocity betwee(n 28 and 33 me&tre&s per second.
R^ed weather warning in Greece
On Saturday, the Hellenic Na}tional Meteorological Service issued a red wea&ther w]a]rning in southern Gree^ce to areas of Attica, Peloponnesus, the Ionian Is"l"an"ds, t,he C"yc"lades, and Crete.
The Ministry for Foreign Affairs and t*h*e trav"el agencies organising tr&ips to Gree~ce warned the Finns in Greece about the storm Z^orba.
Also the Finnish E<mb<a<ss<y in At"h"e"ns issued a storm warnin|g.
The travellers were ur+ge+d to follow th{e weather forecasts and local off)icials ’ instructions.
A while ago whe,n I c(ontacte(d them, ther.e were strong winds and rain.
T^he people were quite calm, Communications Manager Laura Aaltonen from Tu%i travel agency t[ol[d STT on Sa"turday.
Aal,tonen described th*e situation to be s}i}mila}r still on Saturday evening.
By the evening the Ministry fo'r F?ore?ign Affairs had received n/o me{ssag{es from Finns in distress.
S.hip.s did not operate in many G`ree`k harbours o;n Saturday, local news agency Amna report@ed.
T.he boat trips offshore were ca>nce>lled on Saturday, the travel agencie^s told to ST`T.
According to t}he Fi(nni(s(h Embassy in Athens, temporary disruptions were expected i[n air and ship tr:affic.
Finnair rep/or/ted o_n Saturday they are actively following t)he weather situation.
Ki}mi Räikkönen summed up the reason fo~r Mercedes supremacy compared to F^e^rra^ri
F\e\rr\ari ’ s Kimi Räikkönen had to admi`t that th;e worst r:ival Mercedes was t[oo tough in the Russian GP qualifying.
The/re ’ s no reason for pani*c in the Fe|rr|ari camp, the exp]erien]ce]d driver estimated.
They just were faster than us, but it '?s not a hu%g%e th}ing.
So far our car i^n the qualifying was t-he best thing the wh]ole weekend, but they jus\t were to/o fast, said Räik/kön/en, who finished fourth and, together wi~th hi#s t_eam mate Sebastian Vettel, was clearly slower than Mercedes.
Ferra.ri had difficulties already in th]e previous race in Si~ng~a~pore.
Räikkönen was asked what i(s the cause fo#r t!he sudden drop behind Mercedes.
They seem to g,o faster t.han us - that '[s how simple it is.
If I knew the reas\o\n for that, w)e ’ d probably go a.s fast as they are goi?ng.
H>owever, I d*on't know anymo_re than anyone else.
This is constant guesswo-r-k, and they appear to be in th"e lead no^w.
Who kn$ows why?
Räikk&önen ’ s future team, Sauber, ha|d a rare tr[eat in the qualifyi/ng.
Charles Leclerc, who replace}s Räikkö#nen at Ferrari next season, wa[s seventh, a.nd Marcus Ericsson also managed to make it to th`e final qualif?yi?ng session.
The tenth position i(s t`he best one the Swedish driver has ha$d i>n over three years.
And even if there were as many as f:i:v:e drivers not participating i)n the se<c<on<d session, the end result w!as still delicious fo$r S}a}u}be}r.
And perhaps encouraging f(or Räikkönen, considering th~e nex+t season.
Y}es, i)f you compare to where they were in the begi#nni#ng of the se?as?on, th.e step forward has been a huge one.
N~e~xt yea#r there w>il>l be a different story, so we ’ ll see, we ’ ll se#e.
That was it - Rob#e#r#t H#ele#n#ius knocked o,ut Erkan Teper: ‘ Robbe i:s back ’
A match between Robe>rt Helenius and Erkan T|eper progessed in a&n even manner in th;e Stuttgart night.
The German had more initiat>ive in the ri]ng, but he didn ’ t m;ana;ge to land good hit)s.
Helenius has a significantly w*ider reach and controlled t/h/e match with his hard series of punches that fou=nd their way i}n we{ll.
The Finn a]l]so w>as obviously in a better physical co(nd(ition than Teper.
The resolve f)ina)ll)y came i(n the eighth round, as Helenius knocked Teper out wit(h his le[ft cross.
The punch was so hard th+e veteran, who was fighting in fr\ont of a home cro>wd, didn ’ t even t+r+y t{o g$et up from the mat.
Aft'er victory was confirmed, Helenius ’ ce<l<e<br<at<ion wa=s quite calm.
I(n the ring interview h%e first c'o'mp'l'imented the good atmosphere created by the au;d;ience and his opponent.
The&n he changed into Finnish fo%r a moment.
Thank y[o[u for a#ll the spectators and Finnish supporters.
We took the b.elt with us toda;y.
Helenius rejoiced ri:gh:t after the mat<ch.
From th{e perspective of Helenius ’ career, this w<as a reall&y big win.
There m-ight even be a possibility to g>o to a wo#rl#d championship match, Hel_en_ius commented to Iltalehti before the matc'h.
A def.eat, on t&h&e other hand, mi"gh"t've en*d*e*d his whole boxing career.
O}f course I 'v,e thought about it.
I ’ m not getting an)y younger, 34-year-old Helenius admitted b(ef(o(re meeting Tep+er.
Number of Indonesian disaster vict\ims can mul!ti!ply
According to The Guardian, the v|i|ce president of t<h<e country warns ab{ou{t a cl@ear ri=se in the number of victims.
The vice president of the country, Jusuf K$a$l$la, says the death to(ll c]a]n reach thou@sands.
Difficult c&ircumstance&s
The rescuers loo=k for those t]rapped in the ruins and also fo)r t=he d&e&ad in the Sulawesi areas that have su&ff&ered worst: Harbour city of Palu and its neighbouring ci#t#y of Donggala.
So far all th=e v&ictims a`r`e from Palu, there is n`o certainty of Donggala situation.
H/undre/d/s o'f people are missing and about 540 are badly i_njured.
There a;re st|ill people trapped in the ruins of collapsed buildings, and th&e rescuers have not ye(t been a,ble to get out.
For example, hotel R!oa R@oa i)n Palu has collapsed.
The rescuers say they have heard trapped people crying fro%m t.he rui/ns, but a lack o+f heavy clearing equipment has delayed rescue w=o=rk.
Indonesian president J~ok~o Widodo h\a\s ordered the troops t?o help i"n rescue and clearing work.
There is a n(eed for arm[y a;n;d its equipment, because ele/ctri/c/ity and communications li"nks are down in many places in the disaster area.
Also fuel reserves a_r_e run}ning short.
Mis>s Fin+l+a+nd finalist ’ s hesitant answer an#d long consideration caused roars of laughter
N,ew Miss F\inland i}s currently being chosen at Billnäs Ruukki.
Each bea;uty f*inal*ist was asked a question during the interview r#o#und.
The finalists d,r,ew a question from a glass b`owl on a ta#ble.
The hesitant ans?wer of espec:ially finalist number s-ix, 23-year-old Emilia Anttikoski, brought about a hear)ty b>ut benevolent laughter in the audience.
Question tha%t was posed t^o Anttikoski came through Facebook.
Us[er Pirkko-Ella wanted to know w:h:at is the last boo+k the finalist has read.
Anttikoski considered he/r answer for quite a while, b&ef&o&re sh!e hesitantly began:
Thank you f?o?r you}r question, Pirkko-Ella.
The las{t bo:ok I ’ ve read i-s..., Anttikoski said pondering.
H[e[r pause for consideration caus^ed ro\a\rs of laughter i?n the audience, until Anttikoski continued:
Th)e last book I ’ ve r'ea'd is ...
I 'v*e read b>ooks in school!
Probably som%ething related t\o economics.
So the la|st boo.k I ’ v%e read is something a;bout economics, Anttikoski answered.
Af%t%er her answer, Anttikoski rec?eived resoundi,ng applauds fr`om the audience, accompanied by laughter.
Earlier during th?e Miss Finland tou?r Anttikoski attracted attention because she didn ’ t w`ant to pose i>n just u$nde$rwear on account o)f her principles.
Miss Finland 201(8 wil+l be chosen at 9 p)m, wh]e]n last year ’ s Miss Fi%nland Michaela Söderholm resigns the title.
Sikke '{s apple and pear cake is de~lectable
This is a re?cip?e fo{r you, who have your own go(od, sou&r apples, b^e^cau^se Finnis,h apples are dreadfully expensive in the shop.
Pears you might have to buy, even though ma.ny m.i.ght a!lr!eady have a p;ear tree growing, too.
It is poss/i/ble to m\ake this cake just fr]om a?pples, if you don't want to buy pears.
Obviously t`he fla+vour is more diverse, if y`ou also invest in a pear.
Peel t?he apples and th*e pear, remove t^he cores.
Slice th*em.
Mel&t the butter i?n a pan.
Beat the eg?gs and sugar i\nto a froth, the+n add corn flour a*nd melted butter.
Combine cor*nstarc*h, i.e . maizena, a{n{d baking powder, and add those to t`he b,atter.
Add almond f,lour and wheat flour, m+ix well.
Line a bread pan wi-th baking sheet paper, spri-nk-le two tabl#e#s#po#ons of sugar on the bottom o-f t=he pan, and spread pear slices on t(op o\f the sugar.
Spoon half o|f t.he batter on top o~f pe`a`r slices and s:p:r:e:ad the apple slices on top of the batter.
Spoon the rest of the batt<er on top of t-he appl+e slices.
Bake in a$n oven in 1`80 degrees fo}r about an hour, until the surface i[s nicely brown.
Let c)ool i?n the pan and t"hen remove to a platter.
Do not c]ut th/e cake until i%t ’ s properly cooled.
The ca]ke structure is fragile and ea[sily crumbled, because the batter co,nta,ins gluten free almond and corn flo>urs.

Stat>us symbols d*o n#ot attract friends - Four facts about popularity
What ma{kes a person popular, charismatic o\r admired?
Sy!dney University resea:rche:rs analysed the matter, and outlined two types of ‘ coolness ’ consisting o@f slightly diffe]re]n]t characteristics: generally attractive coolness and i\ts partial count-erp-ar-t, diss~ident coolness.
According to res#ea#rch#er#s, a&t&t&racti&v&ely cool peo@ple had many socially des-ired characteristic[s: they were extroverted, friendly, conciliatory, and competent.
The dissidents, o(n the other hand, wer>e typically distant, independent, rebellious, a#nd ha@d a(n edge to their personality.
They craved for experiences and c;are;d li_ttle for outsiders ’ e"valu"atio"ns.
B#ot#h types ha)d good self-esteem and steady emotional l$ife in common.
Tough r_o_le i>s not cool in the long run: high status during teenage years d"oes not necessarily lead to succes(s l$ater in life.
This is reported in an American st&ud&y publishe_d in Child Development journa^l in 2014.
Y%oung people who started dating e@arly, partied, gravitated towards good-looking groups, and wanted to be popular, as young a>du>lt>s had a b<igg<er ri.sk of substance u[se and stray~i~ng into crime.
They managed t"h"e"i"r relationships worse t>han their once more unnoticeable p.eers.
Luxury cars, designer bags o^r w{at{c{hes signifying high s\tatu\s do not make a person co-ol - or a+t least not genuinely attractive company.
In a res<earch published in Social Psychological a+nd Personality Science i~n A$ugust, most of the people were more wil^ling to befriend a person dressed in a h?igh-s?tre?e?t shi:rt th~an in a designer l/abe/l shirt - ev/e/n though most people chose to wear a design<er shirt for the introductory situation.
If y`ou ’ r^e in the Greek h<o<liday islands, beware!
A storm is abou]t to hit there - a weather forecast is sc_r_eam_ing re"d
During t@h@e weekend, th]e rainfall in southern Greece may b^e equal to the aver&age amount of rain in Finland during six mont|hs.
Zorba storm will hit Greece du&rin&g the w/eekend.
Be prepared i-f you a\r\e staying in the area of Peloponnesus, t`he Ionian Island[s, the Cyclades or Cre%te.
The st'or'm will be very strong, so the Finnish Embassy i?n Ath&en&s reports ab(out it on its Faceb#oo#k page.
Ac"cordi"ng to the Emba+ssy, the Hellenic National Meteorological Service h[as issued a red weather wa=rnin=g to these areas.
Th|e oncomin'g storm is al`s`o told about in weather service Foreca ’ s blog.
Accordi,ng to it, the stron:g:est winds can be up to 4+5 m]etres per second.
By wa.y of comparison, the Kuis/ma storm that lashed Finland early in the week ble_w about 31 metres per s,econd a^t its height.
According to the blog, t{he big;gest c^o^ncer^n of Zorba storm i_s not the wind though, but the heavy ra?i?n.
There can be up t^o 300 mm rainfall i,n the s/outhe/rn Greece during the week#en#d.
This is equivalent of abo*ut a half o$f Finnish annual r"ainfall.
Weather service Severe Weather Euro)pa h:a:s shared a video about the s:torm development o!n its Facebook page.
Ear*lier t:his we|e|k, the Zorba storm has caused flooding in Tunisia and Libya.
Do you recognise Ank=u from Love Is-la-n-d Finland, drool>e>d over by men?

Not many kno\w th#at t:h:e be-a-uty Anku, drooled over by men in Love Island Finland show, als{o appears a.s a craft lady on odd Y"ouT"ube videos published in 2010.

Valtteri Bottas w|as shaki!ng and bursting with adr%enali%ne in Sochi - will he have to b]e Hamilton ’ s aid o_n Sunday?
Valtteri Bottas was still shaking doze'ns of minute(s after his pole position-worthy d%rive, standing i@n front o+f the media.
A great l~ap left beh*ind Mercedes number one star, Lewis Hamilton, and was no doubt important also mentally fo`r the Finnish driver, who has gathered his s&h&are of c$ri$tic$ism th@is se/a/son.
A nice l^ap.
I don ’ t k/now what ha*p*p*en*ed t\o Lewis when he did no>t finish the decisive lap.
I't fee"l"s good, I ’ m still shaking a bit, Bottas c=larified.
I ’ ve had only o}n}e pole position this ye?a?r, in A\ust\ri\a (in midsummer), s_o quite a bit o_f time ha"s passed.
This circuit ha|s been good to me in the past, a?nd aga/in I had some good la[ps.
It's not ea#sy to overtake at Sochi c$ir$c$u$it, so t/he start pl"ays an especially large role.
And naturally B*o*t*tas had to reply to a qu<e<stion whether he's driving for victory tomorrow or whe'ther he has to assist H/amilt/on, w^h^o i)s close to reaching the championship t#itl#e.
M{y goal to t'he race is definitely trying to w<in.
When you have a p>o>le position at the start, it really is th:e o>nly go+al, Bottas states.
But as a t/ea/m, w%e fight for bo$th championships.
Lewis ’ lead t"o Sebastian Vettel is quite bi}g, and the gap between him and m-e i*s very big, s*o I have to bear tha't in mind.
We ’ ll s>ee what happens, Bottas a#dded, thou<gh.
Afte.r the qualifyin'g, Hamilton w_a_s genuinely happy about Bottas ’ success, and also Mercedes team b{o{ss Toto Wolff was p]leased.
Lewis meant to win V`altteri, b&ut he d*idn ’ t succeed in the seventh tu\rn.
Valtteri knows he has to give e.v.e.r.yt.hi.n.g h^e has t.o win Lewis.
A)nd h@e was so charged that a=d=renal=ine w~as bursting from his ears, Wolff enthused.
Wolff was evasive when answering a qu~estion ab/ou/t whether t"h"e team will a%llo%w Bottas and Hamilton to drive fairly.
We're going to have the conversation to:mo:rrow morning an%d then se,e how the ra=c=e i(s going to pan out.
Erno Ki>nnunen from Kitee won th$e Finnish Rally Championship
The Finnish Ral|l|y Ch;amp;i;onship series had a rare ending.
Hardly ever have brothers ended up as Finnish champions a|t the sam_e t_ime.
No&w Eerik and He)nri)k Pietarinen from Tuusula achieved that in th_e final ral]ly driven in Salo-Turku are.a, as Eerik w?on the SM (FRC) 1 a+nd Henrik S~M (FRC) 2 class.
Erno Kinnunen from Ki_t_e_e en%sured the best achievement of hi=s career, a's the third place in the final rally clinched his Finnish c(hampi(ons(hi(p in the two-wheel d;rive c]ar]s ’ SM (FRC) 4 c+l+a+ss.
Competing with a Honda Ci]vic, Kinnunen and navigator Ville Mäkelä beg*an the Turk~u event with patience, since the starting points were clear: a pos:itio:n in the l@eading group w]o]u]ld guarantee th?e titl`e.
In the darkness of Friday evening, the pair ha@d to give others a hand!icap, when part of their ad\dition\al headlamps betrayed th~em in t=he second speci_al stage.
We w~e~re pretty blind fo'r a third stretch.
You c.an't fuss around i{n a situation lik/e that.
O+n Saturday we just followed behind Jussi Teppo, who was second i$n t%he series, Kinnunen s"aid.
Syri=a demands the United States, France, and Tur[key to withdraw the@ir troops
The Syrian foreign m|i|ni|ste|r demands the Un~ited States, France, and Turkey t)o withdraw their tr!oops from Syria.
Speaking for the United Nations General As?s?e?mbly on Sa}turday, Fore>ign Minist?er Walid Muallem says the foreign troops must leave Syria immediately and without an)y stip?ulati?ons.
Muallem said the foreign troop$s ar^e in Sy,ri,a t>o fight terrorism, and according to h'i'm, the war agai[nst terror is ‘ almost over ’.
In h|is UN address, Muallem also invited S.yrian refu`gees to return to home co%untry.
The<re is, however, no e_n_d in si#g#h#t for the war of pa:st seven years.
Over 36<0,<0<00 people have died i`n the war.
On Fri@d@a@y, Chancellor Mer.k.el said i?n Ge{rmany that a Syria meeting has been planned for October, and in addition t$o herself, the pr+es+i+de+n+ts of France, Russia, an<d Turkey would participate i$n it.

Appointment as a justice to the Supreme Court i-s a^n extremely s:ignifica:nt occasion, since it is a life!time ten:ur:e.
Trump alre@ady got to appoint one new j\ustice, when Antonin Scalia passed away in early 2016, and t.he Republicans managed to sto%p the then president Barac~k Obama from appointing hi[s follow[er.
Another pl]ace became open when judge Anthony Kennedy, 81, annou<nced this y*e*ar he is go!i!n!g to retire.
Kennedy was appointed by the Republican President Ronald Reagan, b:ut in many questions he was the so-ca%lled swi;ng vote, who could de]c]i]d]e the position of the co?u?rt o.f nin[e.
He supported abortion rights and rights o.f the s_exu_al minorities, and hi"s vote wa's decisive in 2015, when gay c)ouples nationwide received a right to ma`rry.
Kavanaugh is considerably more conservative i@n his vie=ws.
His appointment t}o the S>u>pr>eme Court may secure t)he Conservative dominance for decades.
Chil,dren have a right to le^t t\h\eir parents see their information
Only the parents o^f children under 10 years see their children ')s health information i.n t!h!e Kanta service.
It is a b-i-g p,roblem, it is wrong, a!nd it is odd.
Originally th_e situ*atio*n in the Kanta service was even more worrying: the parents cou&ld not see the babies ’ medical recor-ds or pres^c^r^i^ptions.
I~n autumn 2016, the situation was fixed f}or under the 10-year-olds w-it-h an amendm;en;t described as temporary
Aft,er that, there have been p{romises to fix th*e practices, but t@he fixing has taken astonishingly long.
Now a fix is on t;he wa{y - in 202_0.
Sinc'e the problem i.s a\n explicit one, changing the law basis should not have be@en anything m@ore than an open-and-shut case.
After tha%t, according t,o a layperson ’ s understanding, it is simply about pressing a butto:n: n_ow the wire i;s cl#osed, so let's o&pen it.
Naturally a child can show their information to the parents - if the ch%ild h~as banking us>er identifiers or an o~ff~i~c~ia~l id!entity card.
But h*o*w many 10-year-olds have th<ose?
An ident:ity card is not free, a#nd a 10-,year-ol,d can ’ t even get ban(king identifiers.
S$o basically it is imp.oss.ible f*or anyone to s%ee a primary school fourth-former ’ s records without asking them to be printe[d out.
It ’ s not that much about the parents ’ rights th@an about th}e chil/dre/n ’ s r'igh'ts.
It is essential to a child ’ s care t,hat paren>ts c*an be involved.
Obviously it's important t.o take care o:f t\h\e teenager ’ s right t:o privacy.
Even min`ors can hav;e family situations, where no[t all things can be freel@y discussed.
Oft\en they are related t%o sexual health, and tak$ing care of it freely is a deeply meaningful huma|n r}ight.
I'n the United States, the FBI began t!o unwrap the harassment allegations ag|ains|t Kavanaugh
According t@o American media, FBI is investigat`i`ng harassment all*egat*ions b\y at least two women.
Earlier this week, o@n@e of the wome!n was heard by the Sen.ate Judi[c[ia[ry Committee.
Kavanaugh had denied the accu-sations concerning al[leged sexual harassment during in his student day%s.
T]he United States President Donald Trump ordered the FBI t%o investigate the al+legatio+ns on request b@y the Senate Judiciary Co|mmi|t|tee.
The inve;s;tiga;tion must not ta[ke more than a week.
A:ccordin:g to Washington Po^st, the ongoing investigation is a r:epo:rt more restricted than a crimi#nal investigation, and it may not be,com,e a/vaila/ble to the public.
A man threatened t>o kill polic]e officers at Kajaani police sta*tio*n
An apprehended brawler continued protesting even a~t th@e station.
The police say they too<k the man i;n police custody t@o ‘ calm do^wn ’.
The police was subje#cted to a suspected attackers threat in Kajaan]i d!uri!ng the night between Frid&ay and Saturday.
Th;e authorities report on the i<ncid<ent that began, a{s a ma~n in his thirties was violently picking a fight i~n a city centre r`e`staura`nt.
First the ma:n assaulted another cust,omer inside the restaurant.
T(his resulted in removal fr"om the premises.
Outside the fighter attacked an*ot*her man by knoc@ki@ng him ove}r.
A<s a third party tr%ied to i:nt:erve:ne, the man hit also him.
Th'e triple assault resulted in call`i`n`g the police.
A patrol seized the ma=n, takin|g h~im to Kajaani police station, th,e police say.
Th=e suspected continued to act in an aggre%ssive ma(nner in the police station.
He kicked the other police i~n the l{eg.
He threaten!ed t.o kill and beat up the p>ol>ice officers.
The police say they to~ok t&he man in police custody to ‘ ca<lm d]o]w]n ’.
The man is suspected o^f t)hree assaults and a violent r=e=sis=ting o&f an official in the performance o>f his duties.
Human<i<tari<a<n organisations prepare t<o begin work at I&ndone&sia's Sulawesi - ‘ Clean water is the mos:t urgent thing ’
Un(ited Nations Children ’ s Fund UNICEF and other in\t\ernational humanitarian organisations ar*e pre!pared to help at I^n^donesi^a^n i(sland o<f Sulawesi, recounts Kirsi Haru, Chief of Communication at UNICEF Finland.
The local authorities are in char_ge of th<e rescue operations, but the need for ex(t(ra help i^s apparent already in th[is stage.
UNIC,EF operates i:n nearly every country, and w$e have long-term projects also in Indonesi<a.
UNICEF always has a co@mplete emergency help preparedness, i%n addi]tion to i:ts normal operations, Haru says.
The first tas]k n|ow is to f*in*d th>e people from the ruins, both the living and the dead.
In t~he Sulawesi city of P&alu, t~he rescue operations ar~e ongoin, but a bit nor*th*er in the area o*f Donggala, the situation is less clear.
There are stil)l places, where communications do n?ot w%o%rk.
Relief actions are difficult, because also th;e roads ar_e blo;ck;ed, Haru states.
Buildings o%n Sulawesi are often lightweight, so the d%estru%c%tio%n caus#ed by the earthquake an;d tsunami are great.
When the sur{vivor{s have been found, they n<eed shelter - in the beginning fo~r example t/ents - an"d clean water.
In crisis situations, clean w:a:ter is t`he most urgent t!h!i!ng.
First thing we can generally offer t~o people are water purification tablet]s that als=o UNICEF has i!n stock.
Th'e goal is to rep$air the water systems as soon as possible, but in e~m~erg~e~n~cy situations, water is tran.s.p.orte.d wi[th fo'r example trucks.
In crisis situations, ma|n|y children are separated fro-m their p^a^r^e^nt^s.
Find,in,g the fa~mily members and reuniting families is one pa%rt of the Unicef duties.
Food assistance is organised by, am(ong oth!ers, WFP (World Food Prog~r~amme), which works a's a branch o<f UN.
In the first stage, previously raised f]unds are used f*or emerge&ncy help.
Unicef, among others, h/as how,ev,e,r already began t]o raise funds to help th}e victims of the earth quake and tsunami in Indo=nesia.
Billio"na"i"re Elon M'usk to quit as T$e$sla Chairman o]f the Board - 20 million dollar fine for his tweets
Elon Mu's'k, f_oun_der of companies manufacturing space rockets a-nd electric cars, avoids fraud charges with a deal with th?e United S)tat)es ’ S]ecurities and Exchange Commission.
B$illionaire Elon Musk quits as electric ca-r com@pany Tesl)a's Chairman of the Board and agrees to a 20 million dol\lar fine.
Musk steps down a$s part o*f a d"e"a"l h:e made with the authority regul[a[ting the United States ’ securities industry.
Wit<h this deal Musk avoids fraud c_ha_r_ges.
The United States ’ Securities and Exchange Commission SEC threatened musk with a s`e`cu`rity fraud because o#f t{h{e tweets he sent i^n Au`gust.
In the~s~e tweets, Musk wrote he i[s preparing to take electric car company Tesla pr"ivate, which resulted i"n a quick ri[se in the company's share pr-ice.
Accordin}g t+o th*e deal, Musk is not allowed to act as Tesla chairman o=f the b_oard for three years.
In addition, Tes@l@a must nominate a new “ indepe]n]dent member ” to i<ts bo!ar!d and take two “ independent managers ” to i&ts management g{roup.
Tesl^a also has to found a committee to supe)rvise Mu/sk ’ s communications.
Musk is allowed t-o c}o}ntin}ue as Tesla CEO.
On t/op of Musk's per-so-nal 20 million dollar fine, Tesla as a company als)o h^as to pay an equivalent 2'0 million fin:e to the Commission.
Tweets mis=l=ed investors
A)cco)rd)ing t|o SEC, Musk's tweets misled investors a{nd Tesla shareholders.
Musk claimed to have secured funding t_o re,p,u,r,c,hase Tesla from th]e stock mark)et to a private company.
According to the billionaire's t[weets, the company would have been b(ought out fr)om the st'ock mar&ket with a stock price o)f 420 dollars.
A?fter the tweets, Te+s+la ’ s stock price rose o@ver te+n per cent in twenty-four ho\urs, but later fell.
According to SEC, Tesla's claims had no basi|s of an-y kin&d.
Acco]rdi]ng to t{h{e Commission, in reality he had not negotiat|e|d the funding he cla&imed to have.
Neither had h%e discussed withdrawing the company from the market with other mem;bers of th`e managing group o_r the company boar!d.
Friday this week, t;he price decreased 1^4 per ce(nt, a|s SEC published the fraud charge.
T+he news abo#ut settlement are expected to again re-enforce the company's stock pri}ce.
The r]ea]son is not th+e Last Judgement
Naturally t*h*e Cathedral's bells won't r;ing when the h'ands are not moving.
I#t ';s a technical malfunction.
The clock i<n Helsinki Cathedral tow;er has stopped.
The hand/s point at twelve o ’ cloc:k.
T"he situation is like f$ro$m a mediocre horro=r film: i+f only there was incantation coming from t*he cr#ypt and the organ would play by themself.
This is naturally not the c!ase, be,ca,use t/he clock has stopped beca/use of a technical malfu^n^c^tio^n: it ’ s broken.
A repairer has checked it, bu+t ther^e is a p}art brok/en and we are waiting to get a n[ew part, sacristan Eveliina Ja(msen says.
A_t the same time Jam+sen confirms the fact alrea%dy mentioned by Kir<kk<o Helsingissä Twitter account.
T}hat is t?o say, the reason for th+e clock stopping is n)o)t the Last Judgement, t:he account mentions.
Jamsen sa?ys the church bells d}on't ring because o)f a malfunction.
