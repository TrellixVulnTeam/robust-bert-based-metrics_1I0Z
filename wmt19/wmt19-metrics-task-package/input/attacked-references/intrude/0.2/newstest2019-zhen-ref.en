Acco$rding t}o the UK media, Admiral William Moran, the deputy director of Naval Operations, sa"id t~ha~t even th{ough the U+S Navy was reinvigorating t'o cope with th)e increasingly worrying Russia on bot~h side\s of t]he Atlantic, the United States would continue to take t?h?e Asia-Pacific region as the fo[cus of its navy--the Pentagon had expanded the scope of Asia)-P)acif)ic region to include t*he Indian Ocean - As%ia - the Pacific.
Accord?ing to the repor(ts from the sit{e of "Jane's Defence We.ekly '.' on September 24, China and Russia were c`lassi`fie`d as the strategic compet<ito<rs in the ne%w national defense stra~tegy, which was announced by the United States at the beginning o-f the year.
Then, the US Na*v*y recommissioned the Second Fleet to stan=d up against the Russi*an activities m/ore directly.
It was reported that t?hese ac"t"ions raised some doubts and concerns am*o*n*g its alli;es an|d a{nal{yst{s . They we(re af~ra~id that th*e US Navy might go far away from the strategy of "Rebalancing toward Asia-Pacific", which marked the Obama administration.
However, Admiral William Moran sa~id that the focu's of the U~S Navy would sti%ll focus on th$e West Pacific.
At the r$o$u$n$d-table d=i=s=c=ussion, which was hosted by National Bure#au of Asian Research i=n Washington on January 24, 2018, he said: "For u+s, t"here a:r:e any significant changes. "
Moran sai)d: `&` The focus r`emai`ns on rebalancing, shifting focus or whatever you wan(t to describe it. "
B$ut he admitted that the United St(ates kept c^los^e relations with Europe.
H;e said: `!` We woul%d continue t&o focus on the growth of the West Coast. "
Although he pointed out that the overall policy a%b%out Russia fell within the terms of r/ef/eren/ce of the United Sta~t~e~s Secretary o%f Defense, he warned: "The Russians migh(t face th=e d^em^og^rap^hic an,d econ>o>mic challenges, but th(e hi?story demonstrates that they will b$ecome very tough if we have a conflict with them. "
Admira~l Moran s}aid that as a pa_rt o`f the comeback action to fight against Russia, China and other co/mpetitors, the U/S Navy was dynamically deploying the troops into a `/` new campaign mode". This would help to make the opponents u|naware unprepared for the deployments o@f th>e American aircraft carrier bat+tl+e group or other assets a,t any specified time an}d pl'ace.
He said: "O(ur N_a_vy and Marine Cor&ps support it--the concept of unpredictable ba,ttle . We should no]t s<h<ow up at the same pl|ace again and agai=n like clockwork .--This is our approach. "
It was reporte/d that t~he first to t-ry this new approach was th~e `^` Harry Truman" aircraft carrier battle g^roup, and its early deployment included th=e working visits to ports and the p"atrols in a`reas, where it usually only passed.
Moran said that the US Navy was currently tr?ying to ensure its allies to k`n`ow that these warships would still patro}l i,n t@he traditional areas, and solving the logistical probl&e&ms and family liaison problems f?or new de=p=loym=ent process.
Vice A+dm+ira+l Michael Noonan, the Commander of Royal Australian N&avy, a&lso delivered a speech i$n this event to indicate t\hat t;he Australian army co$u$ld s,eamlessly cooperate with the American aircraft carrier battle group.
He said that this situation would c)ontinue as the Royal Australian Navy ha@d pla^nned to purc#hase anoth<er 9 frigates with the `'` Aegis" combat system.

Repo+rt on November 5 of China News A round-up report: the U|.S. midterm el=e=ction starts c%ounti%ng down.
On November 4, President Tr?ump and hi)s d/e/mo/cratic opponents actively `/` drum up votes" on their c}ore voters.
Both Parties indica.ted t>hat voter turnout will b%e a key factor to influence the s:itua:tion of election.
According to the report, in 48 hours before the Americans went to vote, Trump was busy attendi>ng the rally for the Republican candidate, while the former President Obama just arrived in Indiana t"o r$ally for Joe Donnelly, t{he Democratic candidate of t`he Federal S[enate, w/ho ask`e`d for emergency he#lp for the sit@uation of election, and t~o s}h}ou}t out h'i's final pre-election a>ppeal.

Voter`s ’ political enthu<si<asm h$a$s boosted to a rare peak and early voting of so.m.e states has been fa[r more than usual.
When suc;cessive A-me-rican presidents face t+h+ei+r fir.st midterm elections, their parties tend to have fewer members of congress.
Ac'c'ordi'ng to the new poll released by the "Washington Post" and th!e ABC News o_n Day 4, altho%ugh t:he Democr(a(tic situation of election for the House of Representatives maintains an a?d?vant?age, th?e Republican(s could benefit from an e;co;n;omi;c assessment and Trump's stric't focus on border security.
T;he poll in:dic:at:e:s that more registered voters like the Democratic ca)nd)idate of th~e House of Repre=s=entat=ives than the Re@publica@n candidate with proportion o=f 50% versus 43% . However, i't st'il'l falls down compared with leading of 14 percentage points in August.
According to t}he other po^ll made by NBC an*d the Wal~l Street Journ?a?l, the Democrats st"ill take 7 percentage points ahead of the Republicans.
It is reported th@a@t Obama told the crowds at a rally f-or Senator Donnelly, `;` When people don't tell the trut`h, and words do n'\t mean a-nything anymore, that ',s going to have ev?i?l consequences.
Democ]r]a]c]y does n\ot work when people can only desperately tell lie!s!. "
"Now, t~he only wa+y to stop the beha)vio)rs of these Republicans is you and your v@ote@. "
The Democrats face the tou,ghest situation of election in the Senate f:o:r decades, an@d now th+e Republicans hold more than half (51) o[f s{eats.
However, the situation o`f election in th.e House of Representatives is relatively advantageous, and the Democrats need to win 23 seats to take co<ntr<ol of 435 seats o;f t-he H)ouse of R'epres'entatives.
A~ccord~ing to t>he ass;essmen;t o.f analysts f:rom FiveThirtyEight.com, a website for predicting the situation of election, the possibility that the Democrats win t}he House of Representatives ca#n reach up to 85%.

People ’ s Da$ily Online, Beijing, November 5 (Wang Xiaoyan) - In the c[u[r[re[nt tide o)f `!` mass entrepreneurship and innovation", more a(nd more technology com%panies have b%e%gu%n to p&ay attention to paten"t R & D and related protection work, and deepl?y explore the potential v]al]u]e of patents to occupy t'h'e market d,o,mination.
Similarly, man\y technology companies have encountered n-umerous infringements crisis in paten!t technology lic?ens?i?n?g and patent technology use.
At th@e end of 2017, Ta~n We/i, He Zh.ang.hong and L:ai Bin from Guangdong Provin%c%e, o*n the grounds of patent infringement, appealed the developer of "Didi Chuxing" APP, Beijing Xiaoju Technology Co~., Lt(d. (hereinafter referred to a<s Xi;aoju Technol^o^gy), th|e operator, Didi C'huxing Technology Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred t+o as Didi Chuxing), the seller, Guangdong Pacific In;ter;ne;t Information Services Limited (hereinafter referred t\o a#s G)uangdo)ng Pacific) to the Guangzhou Intellectual Property Court.
The three plaintiffs requested the cou>rt to order th"at the t?h?ree defendants immediately stopp?ed the actions of manufacturing, s#ellin#g, offering for s+ale, and using t=h=e plaintiff ’ s patent.
On Octo:ber 30, 2018, China Judgm`ent Online pu%bli%s%hed the "First-instance Civil Ruling Pa[pe[r of Infringement of Inv[ention Patent R#ig#h#ts between Tan Wei, He Z$hangh$on$g and Be)ijing Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd.", which disclosed some de)tai)ls o"f case in whic_h the Didi Chuxing APP was sued for patent infringement.
T>he three plaintiffs be:lie:ve th.at they are the patentees a;nd inventors of the `%` carpooling s}ervic}e syst:em and method based on mobile terminals", a:nd the whole operation process o[f the "ride;-sharing" application in the "Didi Chuxing" A&P&P corre+spo+nds to the technical solutio+n of the patent protection involved in the case, which formed a patent infringement.
H+owever, d^ur^ing the court ’ s ruling, Xiaoju Technology believed that G\ua\ngdong Pacific wa=s not an eligible defendant . It only provided free downloads of the involve>d A@PP `-` Di|d|i Chuxing" on the I-nte-r-net, and di}d not implement the patent method involved . There was n$o direct or indirect infringement behavior, and i:t s@h@ou@ld not b+e included as a defendant in this case.
Secondly, th$e infringement of thi_s case was not in G\u\angdong.
Accor>ding to the la:w, th}e infringement o[f the patent involved should be the place where the p)aten)t method involved in the ca/se wa,s co.mpletely implemented . Therefore, t/h/e jurisdiction of the court w&as challenged a\nd the case was requested to be transferred to the court of the defendant's d[om[icil[e, the Beijing Intellectual Property Court.
The Guang#zhou Intellectual Property Court held that the defendant Guangdong Pac[ific p=ro=vided t`h`e alleged infringement Didi Chuxing APP product on i?ts o@n@line platform . It is not inappropriate for the p{l{aint{i{ff to list Guangd:ong Pacific as a defendant.
And the defendant Guangdong Pacific ’ s domicile is lo=cat=e=d in Guangzhou, under the j#u#risdi#ct#io#n of the Guan[gzhou In/tellectu/al Pr#opert#y Court.
Th@e defendant Xiao^j^u Technology advocated tha=t the cas_e b=e transferred t(o the Beijing I>ntellectua>l Property Court for trial with inadequate evid#ence . The Court dismissed th$e defendant Xiaoju Technology Co., Ltd. ’ s objection to the jurisdiction of the case, and ordered i(t assume the acceptance fe)e for the case.
At present, t*he other t=rials o<f the c^ase have not been announced, a"nd the reporter will pay close attention t=o the follow-up details of the pate)nt infringement case of Didi Chuxing.
Exclusive Intervi^e^w with CEO o@f the Commonwealth Scientific and Industri`a`l Research Organization: Australia-China Scienc>e and Technology Cooperation Achieved Re_m_arkab_le Results
"China ’ s science and technology have developed rapidly in th>e p]ast few d{ecad{e{s, an<d Australia a_n_d Chi;na can achieve fruitful results by going forward hand in hand in the sci,enti,fic field. "
Larry M!a!rshal!l, CEO of the Commonwealth Scientific and Indus`trial Research Organization said in a<n exclus$i$ve interview with a reporter fro@m t|he China News Service in Beijing, the coope(ration between Australia an!d China in the field o/f science a*nd technology has sh$own great vitality from the cooperation i?n dealing wi=th climate change to the "Eye of Heaven" project.
A!s the l;arge;st nation&al research institution in the Commonwealth of Australia, C`SIRO has a/chieved many world famous innovative research r#esults in the fields of ocean, energy, biology, materials and as@tron@omy.
CSIRO has maintained cl_o_se cooperation with scientific research i:nstitu:tions such as th)e Chinese Academy of Sc-ie-nc-es.
"This is a la}sting friendship that involves the trust of partner;s and the tradit>i>on of long-term coopera+tion . ", Marsh$all said.
In May of thi"s yea+r, C'hina ’ s Fiv*e*-hundr*ed*-met*er Aperture Spherical radio Telescope ― China ’ s Eye of Heaven, installed th'e w<o<rld ’ s first 19-beam L-band r=ece=i=v=e=r.
This int{er{n{ationa{lly most advanced 19-beam feed s*ourc*e rec'eiver i=s jointly developed by Chinese and Australian scientists.
Marshall said that t@he suc(cess(ful development of the receiver is ba{se{d on CSIRO ’ s m,an,y years o$f technical accumulation . W,hen enabled, the FAST survey speed will increa?se by 5 to 6 times, meanwh<i<le more scientific observat&io&n targets will be expanded.
"This is the c#ontribut#io#n o)f CSIRO to FAST. "
In addition t=o the above cooperations, CS%I%RO i-s also working c_losely w^i^th Chinese scientific research institutions in the construction of S^quare Kilometer Array radio telescop%e, r%esearch and development of new fuel technologies, energy conservation and emissi+on reduction.
"In the past, scientific researches of<ten focuse-d on problems after hu<ndreds of years, and now mor&e scientific research p#o#wer is ne$eded to s'o'lve the problems in front of them. "
Marshal#l believed that Australia and China are comple*me*n*tary in the field of scientific development, and bo=th countries face a ser+ies of c;h;a;llenges in their development prog_ress.
F+or example, e_xtreme weather occurs frequently in t$he world . Drought and floods have led to a reduction i+n food production and food shortages h`av`e s+eriou+sly affected hu&man development.
At the sam]e time, population explosion, aging, chronic disease an-d othe/r prob(lems are also the serious challenges we f/a/ced.
`>` The co*ope*ra*tion b}etwe}en Australia and China in recent y&e&ars has focused on solving these current problems. "
Marshall said that the key j_ob of Center for Southern Hemisphere Oceans Researc:h, jointly established by CSIRO and National L-abor-ato-ry for Marine Science and Technology (Qingdao), are obs)er)ving El Nino phenomenon a.nd La Nina phenomenon, studying the relationships between these two phenomenon-s and extreme w|ea|t|her, and establishi/ng early warning facilities fo~r extreme weather . The new species of cereals developed by CSIR.O and th?e Chines|e A}c}ademy of Scie^nces can overc'ome extreme weather and can a-l-so alleviate food shortages caused by extre(me w#eathe#r.
"I%n the current environ}me}n}t, technological innovation is difficult to accomplish by onese&lf, i]t requires extremely high cos&ts, an`d the+re are many problems to be solved, so cooperation is particularly important to,day,. "
Marshall expr)essed that the closer the cooperation is, th.e m<or<e l<ik<ely it is to make breakthroughs . This i&s also the significance of Australi;a and China in strengthening cooperation un'der the framework of the "On+e Belt One R'oad".
"Strengthening b<ila<teral cooperation is mainly fo/r cooperation i,n science and technology for us. "
Marshall took t&he example that CS&I&RO has recentl*y develo!ped a gold purification method without using cyanide . Because the traditional cyanide gold purification method i+s very harmful t(o the envir.onment, many countries hope to find a way t/o puri]f]y gold with little environment\a\l pollution.
`>` W_e are very willing t?o introduce this technology to China . This i$s one of the achievements of our participation in the `-` One Bel't One Road" cooper&a&ti&on. "

Ya)n Naimin, membe;r o{f t&h&e Stan+ding Committ(e(e o@f the Ur-umqi Munic/ipal Committee and De>pu>ty Mayor of Urumqi, i[n[tr[od[u[ced that, as a major town in the new North Ro]ad of the Silk Road, has a special geographic;al location advantage . S"ince ancient times, i_t has been an important passage f@or connecting the s(o(uth and north parts of Mount Tianshan, co/mmuni/cating w~ith Xinjiang and the mainland, and connecting China and Central Asia, West Asia a^n^d Europe . It i.s an important window for China ’ s opening to the we[st and foreign economic and cultural exchanges, and has a good investment environment.
Focusing on equipment manufacturing, logistics and trade, and the tourism indus$tr$y, the e`vent yielded unusually brilliant r'es'ul'ts in Ur(umqi with the sincerity of seeking c'omm'on dev.elopment an!d discussing cooperation.
At the talkfest, local travelling me"rchants in Xinjiang signed si:x projects with the c:ounties and districts of Baoji, inv>ol>ving an amount o`f 3..25 billion yuan.

The revitalization of Northeast China is v=ital to the overal^l sit_uation of national development.
Indus?t?rial enterprises in No)rtheast China have a large proportion and a good foundation . For Northe}a}st China, to make innovation m!e!a!ns to ha^ve development and to plan f\or innovation mean^s to pl$an for the future.
It affects the General Secretary's heart that whether the vitality of t=he old industria@l ba$s$e can be rekin^dled a/n/d released.
Ri Yong Ho, the for'eig'n minister North Korea, tol~d the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions were deepening the distrust o:f the Unite!d S.ta.tes on North Korea and it was impossible for No@rth Korea to unilaterally abandon its nuc}lear weap/on/s unde[r such c%i%r%cum%st%ances.
Ri Yong H;o s)a)id on the United Nations General Assembly that Nor$th Korea had taken `-` v&er&y kind actions" dur@in@g the last year, including cessation of missile a>n>d nuclear tests, disman{tling of nuclear t<es<t sites and commitment to non-proliferation of nuclear weap:ons and technologies
`"` However, w=e haven ’ t seen any corr"es"pon"ding response from the United State[s," he said.
"If the United S;tates do/es/n ’ t trust on u$s, we hav,e n)o confidence in ou^r national s;e;cu;rity . It is impossible for us to unilaterally abandon the nuclear weapons u*nder such circumstances. "
Al%thoug%h Ri Yong Ho repeated the complaints of North Kor-ea about the opposition o}f Unit)ed St|at|e|s to "phased" denuclearization, his spe>ech was of gr@eat significance be"c"a"use it did not completely re}fu}se the unilateral denuclearization as North Korea had before.
Ri Yo)ng Ho mentioned the joint statement between Jeong-eun Kim and Trump on June 1*2, an%d at that time Jeon`g-eun Kim agreed to work tow;ards the "denuclearization o{f th/e Korean Peninsula", while Trump promised to prote$c$t t]he security of North K]o]rea.
North Korea h@as always been see~king t/o formally end the 19:50-53 Korean War, but the United States said that North Kor%e%a must firstly aband?on nuclear weapons.
The United State:s also refused to l^oo^se th{e requirements for the in)t)e)rnational sanctions on North Korea.
"The U$n$ite$d States insists on ‘ denuclearization first ’ and increases the pres<s<ure of sanctions t.o ach'ieve its goals in a high-pressure mann|er, and even refuses t[o issue th[e ‘ declarat?ion of the end o@f the war ’," Ri Yong H.o said.
"The t,houg,ht that sanct{ions can make us k)nee)l and beg forg*i*veness is the daydream of th|e people who don't know us.
However, the pro)blem is that su,ch continued sanctions are d%e%epen%ing our distrust. "
Ri Yong Ho did not men;ti;on the second Trump-Kim su?m?mit plan mentioned by th]e US President earlier th]is we}ek at the United Nations.
On the contrary, he empha/siz/e/d the three meetin%g%s between Jeong-eun Kim and Moon Jae-in, the Sou}th Ko~r~ea~n Pre[side[nt o/ver the past five months an:d said, "If the other side of denuclearization is South Ko<rea, but no~t North Korea, then the denu(cl(ea(riza(t(io(n of the Kore?a?n Peninsula wil_l not become so deadlocked. "
China ann}ounc}ed that it will red}u}ce impor*t tariffs on 1,585 tax items from November 1, 2#018.
Since this year, Chin|a has taken t~he initiative to reduce import t%arif%fs.
O.n May 1 th]i]s year, the dr)ug was fully tax-deducted, and al(l import tariffs for all 28 tax items of general taxabl[e drugs, including anticancer drugs, and alkaloid d]rugs with anticancer effects, and Chinese patent medic{in{es wit^h actual i?mports, were adj=uste=d to zero.
At the same time, i#t has a%l%so gre*atly reduced the p]rod]u]ct]ion and import links value-added tax burde:n of anti-cancer drugs.
O)n July 1, tax reductions w]ere imposed on 218 tax items of cars a~nd par"ts.
Af^ter the tax reduction, the finished a-u-tomo-bile tax rat]e of China ’ s automobile ha>s been lower than the average level of developing count(ri(es, wh-i-ch is i|n line w#ith the actual situation of China ’ s automobile i{ndus{tr{y.
This tax reduct,i,on w!il!l drive the restructuring o~f the industry and the optimal allocation of resources, a.c.celerate the survival of the fittest to help i<mpro<ve the quali%t%y of products and se@rvices . It is exp.e.c.ted to promote th&e adj`u`stm`e`nt of a^utom^o^bil^e prices to a certain extent, so that consumers can get mo_re benefits.
On July 1, t%ax reductions were impo=sed o'n 1449 tax items of dai%l%y consumer goods.
The ta"x reduction o'n daily consumer goods is closely bound up w!it!h people ’ s need of better li;ve;s.
This t%ime ’ s tax reduction not only i*n*volv*es lot's of items but also has strong dynamics, wit=h a"n average tax reduction o@f 56%.
The r>eduction o*f taxes o`n daily consumer goods direc~tly benefits the consumers and promotes the competitiveness of domestic industries.
Novembe{r 1, ta}x r\eductions will be imposed on 1{5{8{5 industrial product tax items of electromechanical devices, parts and raw materia:ls.
Appropria/t/e/l/y reducing t_he i_m_port tariffs o:f some domestically in;dustri;al products with urgent needs can attract more foreign capital, help increase domestic effective supply, assist industrial upgrading, and contribute t)o enterprises all<oc<ate resources on a g,loba,l sc#ale, reduce production costs, and also b\enefit for reducing the press-u-re o_n the domestic environment.
Relevant person i|n charge of Customs Tariff Commissions Office of the State Council intro^d^u^c^e^d that the above f_our times initiative ta&x reduction an/d the third step t)ax reduction implemented on this year ’ s Ju(ly 1 in accordance with the results of the exp$an$s$ion of the infor'mation t:e:c:hn:olog:y agreement negot]i]atio]n will result in the overall tariff l}evel fell from last year ’ s 9$.8% to 7.>5%.
T]he adjusted overall tari$ff level is slightly higher than that of the EU, lower t>han most developing c_oun_tri_e_s, at a moderately low level, and basically matches Ch[ina ’ s developing count'ry status and d{evelop{ment sta[ge.
According to the person i|n charge, as one of the impor;tant indicators o`f t"h"e deg~r~ee o%f openne%ss in China ’ s trade in goods s[ector, the overall level of tariffs should be compatible with the stage of China ’ s economic de$v$elopment an%d reflect the ch~aracteristi~cs of the times.
China ’ s trade in goods scale ranks f?irst in the world, and i>t has already had the ec(onomic fou%ndati%on to further expand its openness . However, there is still a gap between the quality a]nd eff&i&cie&ncy of trade deve}lop}ment compared with developed economies . Therefore, the ov&erall level of t~a~ri~ffs shou'ld b<e appropriately lowe,red.
Tariff i}s a kind of protect means fo)r compliance . T]h]e level of tar&iff should be compatible w?i?th industrial competitiveness t`o encourage healthy competition . W(hile overprotection goes against the industry develop\ment and quality improvement.
Tariff rate adjustment must balance p@ro@du@ct@i@o@n needs wi+th consumer dem&ands.
Focus o+n reducing the commodity t_ax rate that has a large domestic demand and contributes to the transformation and upgrading of th)e industry, an~d striving t'o increase the import of characteristic advantage products with relatively concentrated need&s of the peop;le, continuously improving the sen[s[e o;f ga=in of ent+e+rprises and the public, and meeting th(e upgrading nee>ds of the industrial structure and consumpti[on structure.
Th<e tax reduction should balance the financial rev@enue and the affordability o|f industrial development.
I#n the choice of specific tax-reduction commodities and range of tax r@eductio@ns, we must p^lan and co>or>dinat>e the domest"ic a:nd international m$a$rke$ts, the upstream and downstream aspects, production and consumption relationship, an@d m]ai]nt]ain the stead:y development of China ’ s economy.
Th&e principal stressed that this y|ear i.s t(he 40th anniversary of reform and opening up . China ’ s initiative to reduce the overa+ll l,e,ve,l of imp&ort tariffs i|s a major m;easur;e based o(n China ’ s own needs to achieve high-quality development . It is conducive to the overall pla/nnin/g and utilization of international a]nd foreign resources t`o p!romote the quality o$f domestic supply systems and meet the upgrading consumption needs of people.
This ac\tion and measure shows tfhat Ch'ina will constantly pursue an opening up strategy of m}utual benefit and win-win result, firmly support economic globalization, steadfastly uphold the pr&incipl&e of free trade ru~le and the multilateral trading system c\ent\ere\d o,n the WT[O, and continue to draw development mom|entum from opening u)p t]o the world to also a~llo~w China ’ s development to bette\r b-ene-fi-t the world.
Serbia announced t$o enter the top defe?nse readiness condition . Se;rbi;an President and Russian President will meet t?o discuss the situation in Koso?vo tomorrow.
Yugoslav news agenc$y reported by q=uot=ing sources from the Office o)f Serbi{a{n President that Vu=ci=c, t+h+e Serbian President, gave orders that th*e Se>rbian armed forces entered the top defense readiness condition in consideration of the fact that Kosovo special troo<ps had occupied the r?oa?dway to the accumulation lake of Gazivoda h`y`dropow`er station under the c`ontrol of Belgrade in n)ort)he)rn Kosovo.
O+n Septe=mbe=r 29, V*ulin, t^h^e Defense Minister of Serbia, announced that the Serbian army entered the overall defense r+ead+iness condition.
Vulin em;phasized that Serbia would continue to monitor the current situatio~n i&n Kosovo as l.ong as Vucic's o[rd[er[s we+re still effective . Regardless of the direction in which t.he situation develops, the Ser-bia-n army will respond accordingly.
It was reported by t*he Tass news agency of R?us?sia th!at Vucic said in an interview on September 29 that he had notified the United State{s, R?u?ssia, Europe and other sides about t(he current situation, and would vi:sit Moscow on October 2 to meet with Putin, t/h/e President of Russia, to see"k P#utin's support o!n t$he Kosovo i`ssue.
When h^e was asked whe)t)her Serbia needed to get the military s/u/ppor/t from Russia like Syria, Vucic gave a negative answer: "I d{on't want a s-ig-nif-ic-ant mil=itary conflict in o>u>r territory. `(`
Vucic a*l*so said that the Serbian arm@y entered the overall d`efens`e readiness condition jus^t for the sake of deterre{nc{e to prevent the c.onflict . However, it wa@s a c%lear warning: Serbia would never tolerate a<ny violent action in Kosovo.
The Serbi=an army upgraded the defense readiness co(n(dition in connection w/i/th the two actions i.n Kosovo.
Ac*c*ordi*ng to the statement o@f Serbia, the Alba@nian people were carrying out t>he mass arrests of Serbian people, who ha@d been living ther`e for generations, in recent days, b+ut these arrested Serbi<an people didn't break any law[s.
Vucic said th\at since Marko Ju^ric, the head of the Serbian government's Of<f<ice for Ko[sovo and Metohija, was beaten and de.taine.d by t/h/e Albanian army in Kosovo, the Albania|n people constantly escalated the i{ssues i"n the region and carried out the inhumane arrests an}d deportations o<f the Serbian people.
Furthermore, over 100 people, incl!udin!g t$h$e me'mbers of ROSU special arm~y of th)e Department of the Interior o'f t.he self-declared Republic of Kosovo, armed p&olic&e, and s-ni-pe-rs, occupied th<e battle field near the accumulation lake of Gazivoda hydropower sta{t{i{on, enter/ed the ecological sport center near the dam in northern Kosovo, and blocked a,ll roads nearby . These areas were originally under t*he co$ntrol of Serbia.
Vuci<c indicated that Ko;so;vo was encouraged by the western countries to make this m]ilitar]y adventure . Si%n%ce the Kosovo army ha#d taken a/c/t/ions without notify|ing Serbia in advance, it violated th~e rules in Paragr_a_ph 1 in Chapter 9 of "Brussels Agreement", and it also breached the U\N Security Co(uncil Resolution 1244 and t^he military technology agreement between Serbia and K~o~sov~o.
Vuci*c had spo#ke#n to Stoltenberg, the NATO Secretary-General, to critic"ize the western countries for th/eir false wor;ds on the Kosovo issue.
The sour}c}e of current conflict was st{ill t/h/e historical grievances lasting for hu&ndr&eds of years between Serbian people and Albanian pe\ople in Kosovo.
For the owne{r{shi{p of Kosovo, Serbia%n peopl:e and Albanian people had different opinions.
Serbia considered Kosov?o as th[e birthplace of its nation and the cradle of culture, because Serbia had bui=lt its most powerful cou,ntry here in t]he 12th c[en[tu[ry . However, th|e Albanian people settled here in la%rge n@umbe@rs only afte&r the Ottoman Empire invaded and the Serbian army retreated to the nort\h.
Th<e Albanian people insisted that t_he Illyrian people of the primitive tribe located at K"osovo in the 4th-5th century were t`he`i`r a'ncestors . Therefore, Kosovo ha/d been the Albanian people '&s territory since ancien.t times.
The subjective politic+al divisions c+o+ntributed to the sharp conflicts between different nations, rel_ig_ions and cultures, resulting i]n the fierc^e confrontation be"tween Serbian pe(ople and Albanian people in Kosovo.
Th-e Albanian people in Kosovo fi<rst declared the independence of Alba@nia in 1912.
After t~he First World War, a large number of Alba^nian people, wh{o were li&vi&n&g i>n the Balkan Peninsula, moved t;o Turkey . T)he proportion o#f Serbian people w_as relatively rising . The actions of "t&aking back their own lands" in the sig,ht of t(he Serbian people were considered as the predations of t-he "Greater Serbian Nationalism" b!y Albanian people . T-he contradiction between the two nations intensified.
Kosovo becam^e the "powder keg '<' of Balkan.
Th*e Albanian sep/ar/at/is/ts in Kosovo liberation army and the S"er"bian army and police engaged i_n armed conflicts in 1999, which led to the NATO troops bombed the Federal Republic o]f Yugoslavia co}n}sisting o-f Serbia and Montenegro . The Kosovo War bro,ke ou\t.
Kosovo unilaterally declared i[ts independence from Serbi"a on February 17, 20;08.
Thereafter, th,e news cam>e out that Serbia a{nd Kosovo would normalize rela^t^i^ons, and sign a global an[d legally binding agreement . However, d,ue to t\he historical grievances between t:he two nations a<nd the geopol%itica%l constraints, they failed to sign the agreement, wh*ic*h was in the control of different forces, including the United States, Eu:r:ope and Rus(sia.
Just a mont~h ag~o, Vucic ma&d&e i]t c]lear for the first time that h$e insisted to separate Serbian people from Albanian people in Kosovo . It exposed th!e con<flict between the two nations again.
Power Communication Still i?n interruption . Difficulties i)n Rescue d^ue to Strong Earthquakes with T(suna(mi in Indonesia.
According t(o fi]gures released by the National Disaster M_it_igation Age)n)cy on the morning of the 30t/h, a devastating earthquake and t&he caused tsunami in the Donggala Regency in Central Sulawesi caus&ed 420 pe@op@le on 28th.
Wilem Rampangilei, head of the Na|tiona|l Disas'ter Mitigation Agency, said that the figure is only preliminary statistics from the Palu in Central Sulawesi, abou^t 80 kilometers fro%m the epicenter . Because of the lac<k o~f large-scale search and rescu$e machinery, many damaged a#nd collapsed hotels, sh%opping malls, war<eh<ouses an(d other densely populated bu_i_ldi_ng_s due to the ea\rthquak\e have not been searched and re:scue:d.
O"n September 2[9, 2018, in Palu, Indonesia, a bridge damaged b[y the earthquake and tsunami collapsed into sev-era-l secti\ons.
Due to the severe damage to power and communication facilities, the e_picent_er of Donggala Regency and the neighb+o+ri+ng Sigi ar,ea are s@till “ lonely islands" that cannot be re;ached, and the numb)er of victims can no^t b&e co\unted.
According t"o med]ia reports h(e(re, Indonesian Vice President Kalla said the death toll may rea}ch thousands.
Power interruption, communication interruption, road blockage, airport damage ..*. The rescue work after strong earth{q{uakes an^d tsu$nam$i is ver]y difficult.
Due to power interruption, som`e hospitals and rescue settlements in Palu re~l~y on f{u{el for pow~er generation.
The roa-ds entering and lea$ving the city a're blocked due to landslides, an!d large transport vehicles, including tank trucks, are unabl(e t)o enter, which makes the f<uel supply very tight.
Indonesian Mini&ster of Social Affairs, A%gu%s said that due t=o r_oad da"m"age, the Ministry d:ispatch:ed emergency r#elief materials such as tents, mattresses, blankets, clothes, food and hous@ehold goods packages from Central Sulawesi a:nd Gorontalo a$dja$c$ent to the earthquake region have not arrived in the disaster a;rea.
The dis:a:ster relief materials transported from the capital Jakarta are b<e<ing transported to th*e disaster ar;ea through the ai$r transport aircraft.
I@n vi)ew of the d@amage to the(contro(l tower and runwa!ys of the Palu Airport du{r{ing the earthquake, a+ll commercial flights have been grounded to ensure the sa+fe+ty and security of the rescue . The airport is o-nly used for the take-off an-d landing of military aircraft carrying relief supplies an[d personnel.
Wiranto, t%he Indon$esian Coordinating Ministry for Politic+al, Legal and Securi@ty Affairs, wh{o directed the resc^u^e in the earthquake z_one, demanded that the power supply and airport commercial flights be restored as soon as po-s-s-i-ble to ensure the operating of hospi_t_al_s and o-ther relief agen%ci%es, so that more res/c/uer/s, volunteers and ai_ds can be transported to disaster areas.
O^n t{he 28th, several stro@ng earthquakes occurred i,n Dongg.ala Regency in Central Sulawesi, Indonesia continuously . The 7.7-magnitude earth"q"u"ake that occurred at 17:02 local time caused a tsunami, which ca)us)ed Palu City, Donggala Regency and Sigi are+a occurred m~aj~or disasters.
China News Service, Beijing, Oct;ober 1 (reported by Yi.n Li) -\- A c?loudle?ss blue sky in the day an:d the red clouds at evening ...... Recently, Beijing kept in the m+ode of t:he mo?s?t beautiful b=l=u=e sky . Thousands o;f Beijing residents couldn't h^e^l^p to change tactic)s to show their pictures on social platforms and const;antly make status updates to show their happinesses . They s#a#id that `]` the mos(t beautiful s(ky(line with a blue sky a;nd white clouds was the best business card o\f Beijing".
Beijing ha"d met the "blue-st sky" since Augu?st.
It could b"e found anywhere i|n Beijing a:t any time that ma_ny residents were holding their smart phones o{r DSLR cameras to take pictures.
On social platforms, such as the microb(log an{d W@eChat Moments, peop=le could see th:e different beauty of the Imperial Palace, T{ian An Men, t!he Bird's Nest, Hutong, and various buildings against th/e b~l~ue sky in the net friend>s' cameras.
Some n>et friends said that such "landscape pictures" were the b+e+st city images o*f Be`ij`ing; and some net friends j#oked that if t@he blu#e sky rema-in the same f~or a long time, the patients with cervical spondylosis would surely be cured; some n*et friends even hoped tha!t `"` the blue sky would last through the wi]n]ter, s.pring and summer, providing Beij>in>g with a blue sk>y across four seasons".
W+hy did the residents in Beijing particularly l;ike to show th?e blue sky?
T(hat's because they had been suffering from t$he fog and h{a{z{e in this city in the past . They lo^oked forward to the b>lue sk)y ea)ge)rly . After starting the "Blu$e Sky Protection Campaign" in Beijing to continuously improve the air quality, there were less fog and haze, but mo$re blue skies . T*he resid/ent/s were joyful to see t[his . And t]hey fel!t so happy wi_th it.
The weather was fin<e i&n Beijing on National Day.
Most of 35 air quality monitoring stations i)n Beijing s>howed i~n gre^en a-t 8:00 am, indicating the "Superior First Grade".
The photography competition with the theme of the "bluest sky" voluntar}il}y organized b|y t^he residents on s>ocial platforms wa$s still under way.
W#hy was the sky so blue i;n Beijing recently?
A?s t:he relevant responsible person of Beijing Environmental Protection Agency explained, t)he mean conc>entra>tion o.f fine particulate matter (PM2.5) was 35 micrograms pe=r c*ubi*c meter in Beijing in August of this year, which creat!ed the b'est recor.d for the same period in history of the recent five year/s.
The real-time concentration of PM,2.5 w|as even less t|han 10 in September.
The major fa[ctor contributing to the "bluest sky" was the overall favorable meteorological conditions i<n recent days . And more importantly, Beijing had persistently carried ou+t the air pollution control . It had vigorously promoted the Clean Ai^r Actio~n Pl>a>n i!n t,he past five years, an{d the environmental benefits were released continuously resulting in the reduction of tota\l pollutant em<issi<on in the region . T?hes?e laid t\h\e foundation for c[o[ntin[uous improvement o=f ai*r quality.
Beijing released officially and implemented the "2013-2017 Clean Air Action Pl<an i_n B^ei^ji^ng" i-n 2013.
According to this pla*n, the authority w,ould continue to guide the allev'iation of functions unrelated to its status a/s national capital, a+nd p-rom-oted the wo&rks o"f clean energy substitutions and pollutants discharge reductions . 4923 coal fired boil'ers were eliminated in total.
Thus, Beiji}ng became t#he first b'ig city of achieving the fu[l[l network of natural gasif|ic|a|tio|n in the Chinese mainland.
According to the data, the annual concentration o*f PM2.5 i{n Beijing from 20(13 to 2017 cumula.t.ively dropped by 35.#6%; the number o:f days tha?t the a)ir quality reached the standard*s increased by 50; the number of days that achieved the Superior Fi"rst Gra'de i@n@c@reased by 2)5; the number of days with heavy pollut-io-n reduced by 35 in total, and the occurrence rate o|f heavy pollution significantly dropped.
With the continuous i`mprov`emen`t of air quality, Beijing a\uthorit\y issued the `'` Three-year Action Pl;an of Beijing to Win the Blue S:k:y Protection Campaign" in September on the basis of t"he a|nalysis of a new round of PM2.5 source . Ac$co$r$ding to the current governance phase a]nd pollution characteristics, i`t focused on the important p{r{even{tio{n and contro}l area&s i[n[cluding the treatment of diesel trucks, flying dusts, and volatile organic compounds, optimized and adjusted the transportation structur%e, industrial structure, energ!y structure and la\nd-\use structure, strengthened the inter-regional prevention and contro&l, enhanced the d-el-i-cacy management of c@ity, prom@oted the green development in an all-round way, and strived to kee(p the "bluest sky '%' permanently in Beijing . T?he sky wou+ld not "be precious", since i|t was rare . Let i%t re*tu*rn t$o be t^he background of people's photo a!lbum, but not the l'eadin'g rol#e.
During this year ’ s National Day Golden Week, the Municipal Tourism C.om.mission, Industry a&nd C#omm#e#rce Bureau, City Urban Administrative a*n*d Law En\fo\rc\ement Bureau, Public Security Bureau and other relevant departments wil[l strengthen the law enforcement i#nspect#i#on o[f t.h.e `{` one-day tour" market, focusing on the `]` six unlicensed" chao/s in tourism, and once verified, the violations will b%e imposed on strict an>d serious p<unishm<ent according to t}he law.
Yesterday morning, the muni*cip*al government held a thematic meet%i%ng on illegal `.` one-da[y to@ur '^' to deploy a speci-al action to further crack down on illegal "one-day tour".
At t}he meeting, the fo[cus was on the "six u=nlice=nsed '.' chaos that was i?nte?r?t?wined with the unlicensed ticket provider, unlicensed t$our guid.e, unlicensed travel ag^ency, unlicensed car, tourist trap a+nd unlicensed website pr?of?it chain . The city launched a special action for `^` one-day to*u*r" on July 28th.
Since t]he launch of the special action, the city has accepted 39 "one-day tour" complaints with a year on ye'ar decrease of 63% . Since the b<eginni<ng o`f this year, the city h=a=s accepted 270 `$` one-day to|ur '~' complaints with a yea}r o}n year decrease o)f 62%.
I&n the past two months, the city h`as checked an,d detained 248 "unlicensed cars", i$nvestig$ated and handled 158 violations of the tourist transportation business, sh>ut down 29 shopping `)` tourist traps" and performing arts ven*u*es, investigated and handled 1?3 "unlicensed travel age<nci<es" and 27 "unlicensed tour guides", confisca:ted 2&6,000 piece*s of illegal advertisements, torn down 31 p@ie@ces of illegal "one-day tou.r" billboards and 3 pieces of f~a~ke bus st~op signs, investigated and handled 1%7%8%9 various typ)es of travel-rel<ated violations, an'd 181 cases were filed by variou(s functional departments with a heavier f)ine of 4.4/8 million yuan and 11`1 tra]vel-]r]ela]te]d illegal criminals were detained.
After rectification, the illegal "o/ne-d/ay tou'r" chaos has bee!n basically contained, and the "one-day to.ur '(' m-ark-et order has shown a stea!dy and good trend.
According to the information, th!e cit(y has continuously strengthe$n the force of il(le(g(al "one-day tour rectification in recent y"ear"s.
In 201@6 and 2017, the Municipal Tourism C^ommission accepted 1,612 complaints and 897 complaints of "one-day tour", a year-on-year decrease of 7+9% and 44% respectively . Thou}gh t"he crack down actions are contentiously implemented, the illegal `"` one-day tours" are still recurrent, formin\g the intertwined pro,fit chai:ns a~mong th+e "six unlice*nsed '"' chaos of unlicensed ticket provider, u_nlicens_ed to+ur guide, unlicensed trav[el agency, unlicensed car, tourist trap and unlicen+se+d website.
Spec?ific?al?ly, "unlicensed ticket provider" is the person who attract customers on the street illegally, "unlicensed website" is the illegal w;ebs;ite provi}di}ng fake tourism informati(on, "unlicensed travel agency '=' enga'ged in illegal "one-da"y tou/r" or an institution without business qualification of travel agencies, "unlicensed tour gui.de" is the tour guide without tourist certificate or practice il.l.eg.ally and emp;loyed by the `#` unlicensed travel agency", `*` unlicensed car '@' is th-e vehicle without tourist transportation qualification used by "unlicensed tour guide" or th*e vehicle with touri{st transportation qualification used f;or providing pass>en>ger service to illegal `-` o=ne-day to;ur ')', and last, t)he "unlicense#d tour guide" will b+ring t$he tourists t<o the specified travel shopping store, t^h^at is "tourist trap".
In th-is s]pecia]l a+c+tion, the city continued t:o increase the fixed inspection a$n$d flexible inspection of illegal "one-day tour". Focus on the illegal "one-{day tour" with hig&h frequency and in;f;luential tourist r*oute poi|nts, th{e relevant departments assigned daily secret investigation teams to make investigations with the tour groups secretly, an+d strict investigation and treatment will be i]mposed according t[o the law, if violations are f"ound.
Among them, "unlicensed car" an&d "to|urist trap" have become t)he two f&ocuses o&f the serious crack downs in the special ac%ti%on.
A~c~c~ording to reports, without "unl)i)c)ensed cars"', the illegal `+` one-day tour '-' can no,t be completed, "un'licen'sed cars" a*re easy t?o be found, remembered and investigated, they are also fix|ed value with a hinger single value.
Relevant d:ep:artm:e:nts used road traffic surveillance cameras t;o increase t"he supervision of the tourist buse(s along the key `=` one-da/y tour" rout[es, and use intelligence measures such as technology prevention an+d physical prevention to find and investigate "unlicensed cars '-' i'n time.
"Tourist trap" during traveling ha]s become a k=ey focus du[e t/o its small number a<n<d operation in locality.
In order to stre[n[gthen the shock and atta?ck on illegal "o#ne-day to.ur", all the functional departments will impose he\av\y and s#tric#t punishments according to law, once they have verified the violation o|f la.ws and regulations.
In August of this y{ear, the city also he>ld a se]minar on legal issues related to illegal "one-day t}our", an^d discussed means a&nd methods combining administr%ativ%e puni=sh=men=t with conviction of imprisonment.
Th>e Municipal Touris:m Commission said t#hat in the future, more formal tra[vel agencies will be en$cou$rag$ed to carry out B.eijin.g "one-day tour" an]d increase the supply o$f formal "one-day tou_r ',' to further occupy the living space of illegal "one-d_ay tour". The specific plan is st@i@l@l under study.
I_n addition, the Municipal Tourism Commission h[as continuously improved the electronic travel itiner/ary information system of the tour group t~o ensure that each group i}s included i;n t(he electronic itinerary platform supervision.
From a to`urist symbol to a symbol of digital economy, w+h+at has Wuzhen experienced in the_se y,e,ars
A;s the permanent site o>f the World Internet Conf_er_en_ce, t,he way that Wuzhen undertakes the divi&dend of the summit attracts much attention.
Si`n`c`e t\h\e first W_orld Internet Conference, Wuzhen has obvious changes ov.e.r the past five years.
In 2014, there w/er/e only 12 enterprises relat#e#d to the digital economy and Internet all over the to{w{n . By t^he thi"rd quarter o.f this year, there h*av*e been more than 500 e[n[terprises.
Thi|s is a miniatu|re of the develop*ment of digital economy in Wuzhen.
The Internet Conference enables local enterprises to accept the enlightenment o`f t?he digital economy and the wave o(f digitization fr:om zero distance . Enterprises have a strong d}es}ire t>o make transformation and upgrade . Traditional manufacturing enterprises have increased investment and research an`d development in th$e aspec\ts of machine substitution, i"nt"elligent ma&nageme&nt, e=tc.
Jiang Wei, the Party secretary of Wu=zhe=n, says that the town will b-uil-d a n,ew e{co{n{omic empowered center in the fu[ture.
T-he development of digital economy c+a+n not be separated from the support o:f infrastructure.
This year, Wuzhen h\as launched a 5G pilot proj/e/ct based on f"ull coverage of 4G communica}tion n?etwo?r?ks and free WiFi.
Mean"whil"e, Tongxiang c_ity, wh+er+e Wuzhen is located, as the first county-level city in Ch@ina to build a sp\eci\al channel for i{n{ternation{al Internet data, has become a hot spot for t^h^e development o^f Internet industry.
Si\n\ce the first World Internet Conference, Tongxiang h@as int^r^oduce^d a to%t%al of 565 digital ec$onom$y projects, with a total planning i:nvestment of 37.725 billion yuan . In th"e first three quarters of this year, the core manufactu*rin*g industr>y o%f digital econ)om)y has achieved a total output value o@f 8.73 billion yuan, a-nd the added valu>e has increased by 13% on year-on-year basis.
"Previously, Wuzhen was a tourism symbol, and then it al{so become drama and cultural symbols . D(ue to the Internet Conference, now i]t has becom/e th>e sym_bols of Internet and digi@ta@l ec@onom@y. "
Sheng Y)ongjun, the mu#nici#p#al party secretary o+f Tongxiang, believes that t#he dividends of the World Internet Co,nf,er,ence will accumulate over time . Ther\e\fo\re, it is mor.e necessary to build a platform to unde?rtake t+he superpos?iti?on and import of talents, projects, techn,ologies and other elements from all areas.
S,h,en Yi, a Tongxiang person, has been working outside f)or 20 years . Du"e to attraction of t$he Interne^t Conference, he returns home to st!art a b+usin+ess.
On December 2 of l!ast year, he particip,at,e,d in the fourth "Light of the Interne}t ')' exposition with high-capacity ta#mper#-#proo#f digital technology sol=utions, which was p-ref-er-red by many customers.
Shen Yi cho&os&es to s'tart hi~s business in Wuzhen not o`nl`y because of the hom;e;t;o;wn co>mplex . "At Wuzhen, it is easier to recruit people th@a@n I have expected, and our application i`s also quickly to implement . Our applications ar[e use)d in th#e intelligent parking project of Wuzhen. "
A Wuzhen avenue pres.ent.s the spi#llover effect of the Internet Confe/r/ence.
This avenue runn=ing no=r=th and south of Tongxiang, not only links up tourist attracti}on}s, but also i)s an industrial a:ven:u:e.
Relying on this avenue, t!he science an)d innovation agglomeration area of Wu^z^he^n avenue co"m"es into being.
The reporter learned that the Wu(zhen av$enue will b>e>co>m>e the ma,i,n land o^f industrial development of Tongxiang in th~e futur,e, taking the lead in applying masses o+f achiev%e%me%n%ts of smart medical care, smart pension, smart government affairs, etc., as well as gathering industries which ac_count for 80% of G:DP f$or the whole city and m'an'y high-level talents.

After aggre@ssiv@e treatment, the survival rate of premature infants of 29 week_s a@nd more gestation is 9+8% i~n China, which has reached th`e level of developed co'un'tries.
ECNS, Shanghai, September 30 (reported by Chen Jing and Luo Yan)qian)--Children ',s National M`edica`l C-enter and Children's Hospital o/f Fudan University disclosed on Sept.em.be.r 3%0 that i#t had introduced the Canadian a:dvan:ced method in the leading "Prognosis Quality Impr"ov"e"ment Project of NICU Hospitali}zed Pre'm'atu'r'e Infants in China".
T&he project result showed t]hat a,fte,r aggressive treatment, the survival rate of premature infan(ts of 29 weeks and more gestation was 98% i[n China, which had reach|ed the level of developed coun#tr#ies . However, the s=urvival r+ate of premature infants of minimum gestation and th,e survival rate of pr.emature infants without compli%cati%ons still needed to be improved grea>tly.
During the p+ast 20 yea~rs, the Chinese government has been pay}in}g attention to the treatment of new#bo#r#ns.
Currently, the infant mortal<it<y rate in Shanghai has dropped to 3.71‰, which is significantly low)er than the national a[ver[a[ge level and ha<s reached the advanc[ed level o.f developed co}un}tries.
The `*` Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU Hos.pita.l.ized Premature Infants in Chi\na" has significantly improved the survival qu,ality o,f premature infants through four years of unremitt=ing efforts.
Professor Ca[o Yun, the director of NICU of Chi{l{d{r{en's Hospital of Fudan University told the r;e;porte;r that it wa!s of great significance for the improvement o/f premature in;fants' overall survival quality and population quality to p_ay attention to the reduction o"f premature infants' survival qua}lity, redu[ce the complication r`a`t`es, improve the n$e$ur$odev$elo$pmental prog>nosi>s, and impr+ove t:h:e overall out{come of baby patients while improving th]e survival rate of premature infants . It was an important prob,lem of concern to the pe"diatric an?d neonatal departments at home a~nd ab:roa:d, and it was also a critical issue in this project.
The "Prognosis Quality Improvement Pro}ject of NICU Hospitalized Premature Infants i}n China" has included tens of thousands of cases o;f premature in"fa"nts of 3|3 weeks and le_ss gestation in China and has contributed t%o 1/3 reduction of th{e mortality rate of premature infants of minimum gestation and small birt\h weight through four yea?rs of unremitting eff.or.ts . At the s?ame time, the s?eve?re complication rate of pre$m$ature infants has been significantly r.educ.ed and the survival quality o*f premature infan_ts has been greatly im}prove}d.
This project has established a set of complete, systematic and effective collaborative quality improvement methods, which a{r{e suitable for our domes@tic c"ond"it"ions a;nd will collaboratively improve the prognosis o$f premature infants and improve t_he level of neonatal care by set>ti>ng up the nationa|l colla'bor'ation network of national quality improveme)nt, intr+od+ucing t#he concepts of c!ol!la!borative qual=i=ty improvement, and combing 25 cooperative hospitals in China.
Children '[s Hospital of Fudan Un*i*versity is connecting t&he forces o]f neonatal departments across the country, and developing the guidelines fo:r th:e diagnosis and treatmen%t of neonatal infections based on the exp_e_rie_nce accumulated in the project in order t+o provide reference an+d guidance for the standard diagnosis and treatment o:f neonatal infections.
I$t is reported th_at in the `[` Prognosis Quality Improvement Project of NICU H"osp"italized Premature Infants in China '(', the pediatric h=ospi=tals has introduced t'he EPIQ metho:ds into 25 large NICU in 19 provinces in order t+o solve the disturbing problem of neonatal infections i\n China NICU.
After more than 1!0 years of cons!tant improvement, the surv_i_val rate o<f premature infants without complications in Canada has increased by about 1/3 . C`anada is now one of the countries with the bes/t pro]gno]sis i.n prematur<e infants in the world.
Th%e EPIQ methods have been widely app\li\e\d to all NICUs i)n C$ana$da, and have bee_n adopted by 6 other countries.
According t/o the pediatric hospital, th|e research results s&how that after implementing the EPIQ intervention f/or t]wo years, the infection rate of pre+matu+re infants will drop by 3,5%, and the us$age rate o'f antibiotics will drop by 20%.
In the fut\ure, Children's Hospital of Fudan University will con^t^inu^e to promote and implement t<hese methods i[n t,he whole country, aiming at comprehensively reducing the occurrence rates o+f all com,p,licati,ons in premature infants and improving the quality of treatment for ne>wborns i}n Chi`n`a.
At present, i[t is an indisputable fact that there are differences and i-nequalities i,n the level of treatment in variou_s regions in C;hina.
According to Professor Cao Y?un's introduction, the pedi)atric hospital will play a leading ro&le as a;n important construction unit o|f Children's National Med^i^ca^l Center . This project covers Xinjiang, Guizhou, Gansu, Sha:anxi an?d many other western provinces, wi-th t@h@e goal o:f gradually promoting the homogenization and standardization of neonatal treatment throughout t-he cou"ntry.
It is reported that Children's Hospital o)f Fudan University is connecting the forces of neo~na~tal de~part~men~t~s across the country, and developing the gu-idel-ine-s for the diagnosis and treatment of neonatal infections based on the e{xpe{ri{ence accumulated in t!he project i=n or"der t,o p$rovid$e reference and guidance f}or the standard diagnosis and treatment of neo-natal infections.
It has bee!n re+veale+d that t+he coordination center's Chinese Neonatal Network located at Children's Hospit"al of Fudan University wi]ll unite 6<3 h;osp;itals across China to carry out the next stage o$f national quality improvement in 2*019, with t$he goal of promoting the homogenization of neonatal treatment in C_hina.
Wu Jinglei, th;e director of Shanghai Heal%t%h and Family Planning Commission, sa_y_s that Shanghai can b)ecome a central city in Asia center . I'ts research, construction of th#e entire service s@y@ste@m, service quality and service ou)tcom)es should have a p>lace in Asia, i)n o"rd"er to truly reflect Ch^ina's medical level.
Xin Shiping: Build t]he "mon>um>ent o{f heroes '"' in the h@e@a@rt - written on the fifth Memorial Day.
On September 30, on th:e eve of t%he 69th birthday of the People '^s Republic of China, w]e ushered i)n the fifth Memorial Day . Xi Jinping and ot{h{er Party and sta~te le&aders came t:o the Tian'anmen Square to attend the ceremony for presenting flowe\r baskets t-o the people's heroes.
At this m]oment, pl_e_ase pay tribute to the heroes wherever y|ou are.
The Memorial Day is not only for r+eviving, bu`t also for awak|eni|n|g.
L|o|ok ba>ck the rich history, every martyr ’ s name re%p%res%ent%s a f.resh life.
They a{lso h'ave fiery youth, sincere love and carin'g families.
However, for the belief that "the doctrine we b\el\ie\v\e in is th{e truth o~f t;h;e universe", and for the pur]pose t_o "spare t_h_e su"ffe"r"ing of the next generation", they are willing to sacrif@ic@e everything.
"I would c$ry for China i'n each da@y of my life".
Through time and space, the heroes set up spi{ritual signposts to gu#id#e t=he way for>wa>rd.
"Where d{o yo|u come fr)o)m and where d`o you go? "; `]` What kind of man you want to be? "; It '^s not hard to have the answers if y^ou un$der$stand the heroes.
In memory of heroes, the most imp.or.tant thing i-s t,o build a "monument of heroes" in t&h&e hear^t.
According to the incomplete s"t"at"istics, since the revolutionary wartime, around 2_0 million ma?r?ty?rs have died heroically f.or n|ationa|l independence, liberation of the pe>o>ple and prosperity of th>e country.
Due to various reasons, many martyrs do)n ’ t ev<en leave their nam|es.
Countless heroes and martyrs enrich ideals with blood, practice faith wit'h lif"e . To remember their names a*nd inherit their sp~iri~t, i>s to protect the na)tion's root an~d soul.
This `.` monument of heroes '~' cannot be stained o(r damaged.
F"o"r some tim:e, the histo.ric.al nihilism, abused entertainment and other undercurrents emerge.
A:ll sor*ts o$f ac(ti(on(s that distort and disparage heroes and martyrs, challenge just conscience, derange value judgm`ents, and cause the p&u&blic indignation and vigilance of the whole s?o?ciety.
Heroes and martyr-s cannot be desecrated, and he]roe]s ca[n not be forgotten.
We cannot let actions that to(uc(h the bottom l)ine drift . We must dare to show our sword a?nd u`ph`old the dignity of her,o,e,s wi=th rule of law an%d justice.
O,n May 1, the law for t-h-e protection of heroes an{d martyrs came into fo"rce.
From th*e perspective o)f ju=d=icial practice, th.e verdict of some ca?ses is to the satisfaction of the masses, which n}ot only effect&i&vely maintains the gl`o`ri`ou`s im|ag|e of heroes in accordance with the law, but also releases th}e positive energy for respecting heroes and martyrs.
A na.tion wit^h pursuits cannot live without h:eroes, and a cou]nt]ry with ideals ca;n not live without pioneers.
It has become a commo`n so(cia(l consensus to recall th'e martyrs and cal&l for heroes.
Cu|rrentl|y, ther_e are millions of memorial f+acili+ties of va`rio`us kinds i{n Chin<a, and more than 100 million people visit the martyrs' cemetery every year.
The hearts of the people ar|e th'e strongest footstones.
Let advocating hero-es, defending he^roes, learning from heroes and ca+ring heroes prevail, and let the spirit of hero{e{s merge into the national blo_od . The `$` monument of heroes" will stand firmly between sk}y an.d earth and deep i^n the hearts of the peop[l[e.

The aim of Italian Eurosceptic government was t;hat the budget deficit was eq@ui@va@lent t-o 2.4% of gross do@mestic pr]od]uct (G\D\P) in th&e next three years, suggesting that there wa?s no debt reduction despi/t/e deficit reduction requirements.
Moscovici, the executi]ve committee member o@f economic affairs o}f t#he European Commission, said on Friday, "We are not interested i\n the c:ri:sis betwe~en the European Commission and Italy," he responded cautiously since t+he proposals an+d sanctions of the European Commission might have little i|mpa|ct o^n Italy.
The officials and dip\l\o\mats o/f the Euro*pean Commission still hoped that m/arket forces would persuade Italy to adjust its budget pla%n b&efor&e Italy officially su:b:mitted it to the European Commission in mid-October.
After the government announced its plan, th^e euro fell to it`s lowest level in nearly tw)o weeks o!n Friday, while the Italian bon_d yields h!it their high/est level in three weeks.
If the deficit goal remained unchanged before the deadline in October, the European C,ommis,sion might ve%t%o the Italian draft budge*t, which has never b[ee[n don:e t_o any country b/y the European Commission.
Dombrowski, t(he Vice-President of the European Commis=sio=n s+aid a!t a meeting in Riga, the capital of Latvia later on Friday that current Italian fi.s.cal plan "se\em\s to be inconsistent with the Stability an<d Growth Convention", whi{ch was referred to t/he EU fiscal p=rovisions.
However, h?e did not mention h[ow th{is would trigger a r|esp|o|nse of the EU.
Bidders may su>bmit their applica$t$ion$s for participation in t=his open tender before O+c+tober 26 this year.

Nearly 1,000 national scenic spots have cu]t ticket prices and t/he decreasing a&mp&litud&e of more than hal"f of them i]s over 20%
[Abstract] As of September 28, var+i+ous regions have in]trod]uce]d a,nd implemented, or issued a document to publish to the p~ubli~c for measures of f~re~e o`r reduced-price opening for 981 s]c]enic spots (74 spots for free and 907 spots for price reducti]on). The prices have b,een re;duc;ed in the s*cenic spots i'n Yunnan Stone Forest, the Dali Three Pagodas, the J%ade Dragon Snow Mountain, the Lijiang River i`n Guilin, Guan@gxi, Fujia}n Wu-y-i Mountain, Zhangjiajie in Hunan, T#errac#ott#a Army i{n Shaanxi, Mount Sanqingshan in Jiangxi a@nd Kan,as in Xinjiang.
In order to implement t-h-e deployment of the decision of the C#e#ntral Economic Worki:ng Conference and the Government Work Report, the National Development an}d Reform Commission issued the Guiding Opinions on Improving the Fo\rmati\on Mecha}nism of Ticket Prices i.n State-owned Scenic Spots and Reducing Tic~ket Prices i.n Key State-o(w(ned Scenic Spots (hereinafter referred to as the Guiding Opinions) on June 28, requiring t}o improve the formation mechanism of ticket prices in state-owned scenic spot,s i~n terms of reasonable definition o%f the composition of tic*ke*t pricing costs, innovative price management metho.ds and st\rict implementation pricing procedures, to ensure to achieve rema%rkab%le res_ults for reduc'ing t:he relatively hi-gh ticket prices in k@ey state-owned scenic spot<s by t\h\e end of September.
Various regions have actively ca:rried o,ut work according to t\he deployment requirements and reduced a batch of key state-owned scenic sp-ot ticket pric>e>s.
A/s of September 28, various regions have introduced and i&mp&lem&ent&ed, or issued a document t^o publi+sh to the public f!o!r measures of free or reduced-price opening f#o#r 981 scenic spots (7>4 spots for fr&ee and 907 spots for price reduction). Among them, t;here are 15?9 5A sce-nic spots and 534 4A scenic spots, wi@th a t}ota}l of 693 and acco{u{n{ti{ng fo)r 70.6%.
Among 90;7 scenic spots which ha#ve reduced p!rice!s, the number of the attr\actio\ns with the decreasing amplitude of m{o{re th'an 20% is 491, accountin*g for 5)4.)3% and the number of the attractions with the decreasing ampl&itude o!f more than 30% is 2`14, accounting for 23.6%.
Yunn{an, Shandong, Guangxi, Shaanxi and o;ther pro@vinces have a relatively large number o=f price re(duc(ti(on scenic spots, of which the number o/f price reduction scenic s_pots in Yunnan is mo$r$e than 1&0&0, with an overall decreasing amplitude of more t-han 30%.
T'h'e governments of Anhui, Chongqing and other six provinces (districts or cities) ha}ve a%ll reduced prices fo'r 5*A scenic spots.
The pri(c(es have been reduced i~n the scenic spots wi:th high social attention in Yu,n,nan S<ton<e Forest, th`e Dali Three Pagodas, the Jade Dragon Sn~o~w Mountain, the Lijiang River in Guilin, Guangxi, Fujian W(uyi Moun!tai!n, Z'h'ang'jia'jie in Hun-a-n, Terracotta Army in Shaanxi, Mount Sanqingshan i(n Jiangxi and Kanas in Xinjiang.
T&he ticket prices of key state-owned sc{en{ic spots a]re gradual re%turni%ng to t|he reasonable range, which is conducive to promoting the tourism industry to accelerate the transformation a%nd upgrading from ticket economy to industrial economy, from minori~ty tourism to mass tourism and fro$m scenic spot tourism t.o all-for-one to:uris:m, a<s well as con)du)cive to f$or$ming a virtuous c_ircl_e of optimization of t}h}e supply structure of tourism industry and steady expansion of the demand for tourism consumption, and promoting t(he susta-inable and heal{t{hy development of scenic spots an}d tourism industry.
The National Deve{lopme{nt and Reform Commissio{n al]so emphasizes that various regions shoul!d strengthen the regulation of p)r)ice order in sc<enic spots, guide scenic spots to improve their services, and ensure to r\e\d\uc\e prices without reducing qual;i;ty.
Moreover, for the problems th>a>t the decreasing amplitude of ticket prices i%n so:me scenic spo-t-s is too small an"d so#-c#alled redu$c$t$ion but no practical reduction recently reported by the med/ia, the National Development a|nd Reform Commission has made a special insp.ection t\o require various regions to seriously solve the problems, timely respond to the social co.ncern.s, a#nd effec_ti_vel_y implement price reductions.

National wide f;il;m-fre;e cotton on-site observation and discussion exchange activities exp~erts walk into t&est fi!e!lds, listen to the situation presentat!ion from CAE Y.u Shuxun academician team representative.
China New's Service, X+i+njiang, Xayar, September 30 (Geng Dan]da]n, Wa;n;g Xiaojun) - Located i]n the Xa"yar County of Xinjiang, th@e cotton planted in film-free c@otton planting test base has a breathtaking growth . Compared with the film cotton next to it, i.t i_s not inferior in any respect . A clu*st*er of snow-white cotton c^ompetes "blooming" a+nd is f<u<ll of b;ranches.
From Se`ptembe`r 27 to 28, the nationwide film-free cotton on-site observation a+nd discussion ex!c!h!an!ge activities w.ere h;eld in Xayar County, Xinjiang.
The re?port?er learned a;t the ob)serv)ation meeting t,hat the f}ilm}-free cotton technology s?ystem with "Chin/e/se Cotton 619" and its supporting cultivation measures as the main body ha-s initiall,y achieved t'he goal of film-free planting in cott:o:n fields, re+ducing th#e pollution of t=he Xinjiang cotton field f;ilm residue to the ecological environment and raw cotton . And film-free cotton integrated technology ’ s research and demonstration have achieved significant progresses.
Ac=ad=emicia=n Yu Shuxun, aca/demic/ian of the Chines)e Academy of Engineering, famous cotton genetic breeder and chie)f scientist of the national modern agr>icul>tural industrial technology syst~em ’ s cotto-n s:ystem, introduced the growt&h of film-free cot\t\on for Zhou Guomo, secretary of the Party Committee o+f Zhejiang A & F University.
"The co:m:preh:ensive technology of the fi=lm-free cotton developed by us ca)n completely realize th#e cotton planting without the fi`lm, and can co#mpletely solve the problem of re@s@idual film pollution and realize green cotton planting. `.`
Yu Shuxun descr@ibed, a=n academician of the Chinese Academy of Engineeri'ng.
Xinjiang i*s China ’ s most important cotton-producing reg:ion . A{ccording to the National Bureau of Statistics, th}e cott&o&n planting are+a in Xinjiang i:n 2017 was 35 million mu, acc~ou~n~ting for 61% of the national cotton are#a.
Since the i.n.troduction o=f mulching fil$m in China in 1982, the filmed area o"f various types o>f crops in Xinjiang has reached more than 50 mi#lli#on mu, and t;he annual u&se of mulching fil*m is about 30 million tons.
Am-ong them, cotton mu@lching film coverage rate reach"ed 1`0`0%, and cotton field mulc^hing film accounted for about 6[0% of Xinjiang film use.
Use film-free cot-t-on for production measurement, and the cotton output can be fully rea[liz[e[d from 320 kg t&o 350 k(g per m]u.
With th@e increasing amount o"f mulchin!g film input in Xinjiang, the re's'idual fi=lm recovery rate is low, the re`sidual film volume in the soil is g{radua{lly increased, and the soil structu,re damages and other problems caused b:y residual film seriously affects the sustainable development o/f agriculture.
The residual film not o#n#ly causes serious pollution to the soil, but a\l\so h/as a great influence o.n the quality of cotton fib)e)r.
Cu<rr<ently, mo}re than one-third of th'e cotton fie<lds in Xinjiang have achieved mechanized harvesting.
In 2017, Xinjiang mechanized harvesting a!rea i-s a;b;o;ut 14 million mu.
I-n the process of cotton m@e@cha@nized harvesting, a large amount o,f bro$ken film on earth surface and the cotton plant are picked up . The broken film dope<d in the raw cotton is diffi`cult to rem%ove during the processing of raw cotton, a&nd c?an not b)e completely removed i^n th/e subsequent textile processing process, seriously a"ff"ec"tin"g the quality of textile products.
O#n September 28, th@e nationwide film-free c_o_tton o>n-s>i>t>e observation and discussion exchange acti=viti=es were held in Xayar County, Xinjiang.
In order to solve the cotton mulching film pollution, si!mp!li!fy the cotton planting technology and improve the cotton field efficiency, Yu Shuxun led h$is tea?m to use 8 years to implement the "Chinese Cot?ton 6\19 '#' fi[lm[-free cotton technology planting, a.ddin.g `;` advantages" t*o Xinjiang ’ s agricu@lt@u@ral green de(ve(l(o(pment.
Yu Shuxun i+n+tr+oduced, with th/e new idea of innovative breeding, t`h`ey cultivate a new line of ex;t;ra early ripening, salin'e-alk'aline tolerance, l~ow temperature resistant, and high y]i]el]d upland cotton "Chinese Cotton 619 '@'.
"‘ Chinese Cotton 619 ’ has achieved a series of sup*port*ing meas|ures such as film-free seeding machinery, improved seedi/ng depth, shallo#w buried i]n drip irrigation z$one, suitable seeding dens-ity screening, an?d reasonable chem!ic!al regulation under the condition of film-free cultivation in southern Xi:nji:ang. "
At pre/s/ent, Aksu, Korla, Alear and other places have established a demonstration b)a)se for film-free cotton, with a yi-eld of 4,800 k`g pe:r h&ectar&e.
Film-free cotton planting has achieved high yi"eld, cost s"avings, environm*e*nt*al protection and improved over+a+ll benefits.
Z\hang Donghai, an agronomist at the Thir\d Division of the Agricultural Science Researc&h Institute of Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, sai~d that through n<early s}i}x year`s of research and demonstr.a.tion of film-free cotton cultivation techniques, th]e produ<ct<ion of film-free cottonseed c\o\tto\n can fully achieve 320 kg t%o 350 kg per mu, a@nd may even be higher.
"The promotion of film-free c@otton cultivat@ion t<ec<hnolo<gy has great prospects. "
Zhang Donghai believes that at present, th[e film-free cotton cultivation technolog"y c/an completely solve the proble{m of soil residual film pollution, but ther_e is still a ce-rt-ain gap between the current economic benefits and th|e cult%i%vation of mulchi/ng film.
"The supp<ort of cotton purchasing price w"ill be conducive to future promotion. `)`
Yu Shuxun said that in t'he nex&t step, h[e and his tea'm will continue t/o conduct in-depth research and large-scale promotion and application o[f the film-free cotto@n, making the industry o\f film-free cotton larg_er and stronger, and co|m|plet|ely solving the problem of soil pollution caused by the fi^lm.

Th`e ex-foreign aid accused Beijing BG Football Club of match-f\ixi\ng, and Be+ijing BG Foo\tball C+lub responded that it was "baseless"--ECNS
Yesterday afternoon, Beijing BG Fo[ot[bal[l Club (her:ei:n:a:fte:r referred to as BG) made an official r@esponse to its ex-foreign aid Anichebe's accusation that i)t was suspected of playing match-(fix(ing . B&G declared that the club ne;ver playing any match-fixing . I^t was absolutely a lie fabricated o[ut o'f thin ai;r by A|n|i|ch|ebe s}o that he could c}ov}er up the fact th>at he had brazenly breached the contract and realize his personal improper economic purpose i?n the course of arbit{r{ation.
At t:he same time, BG indicated th\a\t it would reserve the right to t%ake all means to hold the relevant p?ar?ty accountab<le.
According t{o the "Daily Mail" from UK, Nigerian play*er Anichebe reported to the FIFA that B/G Team he played a}t las|t year was suspe[cted o{f playing match-fixing, including the 21st Beijing De&rbi&es of CFACL in th|e 2017 season.
Beijing Renhe was a&t the cri<tical stage of winning promotion to the top tier at that tim]e, and BG finally los[t 0"-2 away to Beijing Renhe . Ani"ch"ebe played from the first m[inute i#n the game.
BG Club made a"n official response to this Nigerian player's acc+us+a+tion y-esterday.
It d]eclared that after previously carrying out t>he internal investigation, th{e club found n_o m_at_ch-fixing in the past games.
Anichebe joined B#eijing B"G in June, 2017 . In December of tha!t year, Anichebe refused to return to the team to take p<art in th&e winter training without any justified reason . Although the cl"u"b repeatedly urg*e*d, h'e s?t?ill refused to re^tu^r^n.
A*t present, the dispute b-etwee-n th\e two parties has been submitted to t\h\e FIFA and the arbitration is in pro^gress.
It also declared th&at the high-profile "match-fixing allegation" was actually a lie fabricated out of thin air by Anichebe so th]at he could c=ove=r up t|h|e fact th"at h[e h)ad brazenly breached the contract and realize h#is personal i:mp:roper economic purpose in the course of a[rb[itratio[n.
His sole aim of s!land!eri!ng the c=l=ub and Chinese f.ootball was t#o obtain the illegitimate economic benefits.
The club wo:uld not accept any groundless accusation/s, defamation, vilification an>d slander made by an_y organization or individual due to its economic ben:efits and personal grud`g`e.
Therefore, BG indicated that it would reserve the r@ight t\o take al=l means to hold t)he relevant p]a]rty accountable.

I&n Ch`ina, which has a hu~ge user base, the Internet technology h-as a strong a?mplific?at?i?on effect on specific applications.
For example, Chinese BeiDou provides users w.it.h hi*gh*-*p*reci*s*i*on a?nd rel$ia$b$l$e positioning, s|peed measure}ment and t~im~e service, and has specific short m.essage communication capabilities; the rapid development of artificial intelligen#c#e technology has a remodeling feature o$n t,he traditional industries, promotes industry progress, and plays a positive role in m?a?ny fields of finance, transportation, health, safety, e{tc; a[nd the communication technology of sky and ear#th helps effectively solve problems of Internet access for aircraf`t`s, high-speed trains and other transportation means, an.d improve t'he u;ser ',s online experience.
According to the "42nd China S;t;atistical Rep(ort on Internet Development" rele>ased by t?h?e China Internet Network Information Center, as the largest Internet market in the wo"rld, China is promoting social d}ev}elopm}ent a;nd progress with t*he dig!it!ization process.
T"he dividend of t,he development o#f Internet technology is not limit{ed to C|hina . Its achievements also bring powerful driving force for the development of the Internet a+nd even the economic society o^f t'he whole world.
For example, Chinese cross-border e-commerce an=d sharing economy are going overseas, which a>re increasingly supporting the world's economic growth; the development of Chin?es?e cloud co(mputi(ng, big data, Int/ernet of Things, mobile In'ternet and ot,her new generation o?f inform@ation technology accelerates t%o prom+ote the deepening of global industrial division a+n+d econo'mic restructuring, and reshapes the global economic competition p/a/ttern.
As outlined in t~he "Wu;zhen Initiative" issued by the second Worl{d Internet Conference, sh\aring the development achievements o/f network, promoting th!e e"arly formation of a network market connecting th)e world and cre~ati~n~g more employment opportunities will provide strong suppor;t for the sustained and healthy development of t^he global economy and let mor.e countries and people ta=k=e the express train of the in:form:ation era.

In case it causes losses, i$t should be liable for co}mp}ens}at}ion accord>ing to l#aws.
It i)s known t$ha$t t"he mileage o;f Fuj%i%a%n high-speed railway with the speed of 200 km\/h and above has currently reached 1516 kilometers with t-he rapid development of railway construction . All citie~s i?n Fujian Province have the transport services o-f bull)et train . It is expected that mileage of Fujian railway with t[he speed of 200 km/h an"d above will reach 2150 kilometers i!n the next five years.
The enforcement of this regulation will standardize t`h`e administration o`f high-speed r<ail<way safety in F$ujian Provin#c#e, further implement the duties of local governments, coordinate th_e rai)lwa)ys and loc[a[l forces, wor.k together to protect t^he high-speed railway safety, and complete the prev.entio.n and control system of high-speed railway safety in F-ujian Province.

Wang Yi, the Chinese State C/oun/c/i/l/or and Foreign Minister made a speech at the Council of Foreign Relati(o(n(s on Friday, and sa+i+d that curre"ntl"y, the China-U.S. re?l?at?io?n came to a c`rossroad again . I$f both si^des c#an actively t$r$eat ea$ch other w#ith tolerance, expand and deepen the positive coope:ra:tio:n, and properly control differences and contradictions, they can o}pe}n up a better prospect.
`[` T^he China-U.S. re)l)ati)o)n is our common asset which needs us to care abou(t together. "
H:e sa{id that it was expected that people of insight from all sectors o;f both countries took practical actions to maintain the healthy and sta(ble development o<f t'he China-U.S. relation and jointly drove t&he China-U.S. rela+tion t@o move forward in the right direction.
Wang Yi also emph!asized agai;n that China was certain t$o take a development road different from that o)f the traditional great p?ow?ers.
Th`is r'oad with Chinese characteristics determined th@at China would not or cannot repeat the m&istake of a strong country becoming a hegemon, and det<erm<ined that China w.ou.ld not become another United Stat}es, o,r chall&e&n&ge the United States, or even repla-c-e the United States.
W`ang Y|i m|ade a speech with the topic o"f "Opportunity o)r challenge, partner or opponent" and said that currently, the profound crux of the prob>lem is that some American friends believed t=hat China would also make a mistake o%f a strong country be<comi<ng a hegemon, and even challenge and re=place the leadership of the United St=a=tes i\n the wo=rl=d.
"This is obv<io<u<sly a major strategic m&is&jud&gment. "
He said that this self-imagined suspicion w[as spreading, and had am\pl\if\ied t>he existing contradictions, giving r{i{se t%o new doubts, a)nd making it m;o;r;e difficult for C?hi?na and the Unite{d States to solve specific problems and encounter more resistance.
Wang Yi pointed ou#t that th{e road Ch%in%a was walking on was a road for peaceful de?v?e?lopment.
Chinese people have never had a gene f"o"r expa!n!sio!n.
It w:as believed that all countries can li:ve in harmony, and make exchanges an%d mutual le[a[rnin[g.
Regardless of past, prese{nt or future, C^hi^na would never copy foreign mod(els, or require other countries to cop:y C}h}ina's practices.
Earlier, when Wan&g Yi met wi|th Kissinger, the former U.!S. Secretary of St(a(te, in New York, he said th~at China-U.S. cooperation would be win-win a.nd th~e confrontation wou%ld be necessarily lose-lose.
The Ch$inese side was always committed to dev|e|l|o|ping t$he long-term, healthy and stable Chin?a?-U.S. relation and achieving no conflict, no confr!o!nta!tion, mutual res:pect and win-win cooperation.
The State Co`unci`l Information Offi.ce of the People ’ s Republic of China held a press conference on Tu_e_sday to intro@duc@e and interpret th,e white paper o&f "The Facts and Ch'ina ’ s Posi|tion on China-US Trade Friction ';'.
Fu Ziying, the Vice Minister of China's Ministry of Commerce, said a[t the confer;ence that China was willing to s)t)r)ive to p[romot[e the bila\teral trade to develop in a more b)alanced direction and hoped that the U<n<ite<d Stat"es would also show a p\osi\ti\ve a"t"tit"ude.
ECNS, October 1--According to fo"rei"gn media reports, S&u&law&esi, an Indonesian island, was hit by st@rong earthquake and tsu&nami on September 2*8, a'nd m)any coastal cities were heavil-y damaged . The la!t!es!t information showed that the death toll had rose t<o 1200.
According t_o the reports, th(e tsunami stroke Donggala i~n Palu twice since it was near the ep`ic`en`ter of the quak|e . After the "golden 72 hours ';' for rescue, the authority thought that the death toll woul$d c=o=nti=nue t|o rise.
O]n September 3_0, 2018 local time, the rescuers were c\arrying an earthquake survivor saved under t;he ruins of a restaurant in P^alu, Central Sula)wesi, Indonesia.
An o!ff!icial from t]he disaster relief dep`artment said that the h#uge waves brought b?y tsunami were up to 6 meters high . The impacts of earthquake and tsunami h+ad exceeded people's orig>inal estimation.
I=t was learned that hundreds o_f people were celebrating a fes;tival o:n the beach wh$e$n the earthquake a_n_d tsunami struck . Many people were swept away by huge waves a<n<d died.
A+n official sa{id that the tsunami w$a$s mo^ving towards the shore at 800 miles a+n hour, an&d a lot of buildings and infrastructures were destroyed.
He said that thousands of ho[u[se[s, hospitals, shopping malls and hotels collapsed, and th.e debris flow cau}sed by th}e tsu<nami c^ut off a major highway in P/alu.
In Sulawesi, a bridge ac\ro\s\s a coastal river fe$ll d"o"wn.
O=n September 30, 2018 local t#im#e, Joko, t%he Presid+ent of Indonesia, visited Palu in Central Sulawesi after the e|arthquake.
T+he Indonesian President Jo#ko visited the disaste$r areas on September 30, an=d said that the troops had bee,n sent o/ut to assist the rescu_e . He also called for th,e victims to be patient.
Joko pointed out th,at it wa,s very hard t~o carry out the rescue activities b:ecaus:e of in\suffici\ent heavy-duty machines and people.
H&e heard that many disaster areas wer(e short of drinking water, food, fuel an@d other mate)rials, and many stores were clo[se[d af%ter th&e earthquake . Therefore, planes were sent out to airli:f:t supplies.
H^e called for the victims to be patient, and aske?d them to st<ay in the original locatio[n to wai@t for rescue.
The rescuers in Palu said they heard cries for h(elp from a inside buried hotel, but they could d@o no.thing bec%ause t+hey didn't have heavy-duty machines t^o remove the r/ub/b/les . Some rescuers had to save p+e+ople with their bare h[an[ds.
Ka&lla, the Vice President o}f Indonesia, said that the elect/ri/ci/ty and communication in some pl^a^ces were cut off, so the informat*ion was block'e'd . T~he number of deaths in this earthquake and tsuna=mi might finally rise up to several thousand.s.

We'd like to go t>o the Golden Bauhinia Square to watch th}e National Da:y flag-raising ceremony! `{`
In th:e morning of October 1, Mr and M!rs Song, w[ho specially flew from Ningxia to Shenzhen and tran-sferr-ed to the first train of Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail L:i:nk f{o{r National Day, ac>cep>te>d a(n int"erv"i"ew of a reporter from China News a!t t@he West Kowloon station in Hong Kong and inquir>e>d such information.
I$n the morning of Oc`to`ber 1, i*n o,rd,er t%o celebrate th'e 69th anniversary of the fo+unding of the People's Republic of China, the Hong Ko+ng SAR Government held a grand flag-raising ceremony at th|e Golden Bauhinia Square.
According to t'h'e statistics of the Immigration Control P/oint, as o!f September 30, the n]umbe]r of p~a~sseng~e~r~s entering Hong Kong vi@a the West Kowloon station of the high-speed railway hav]e exceeded 300,000.
At t}he very time of the 69:th anniversary of th]e founding of the P,e,ople's Republic of China, the West Kowloon boundary che{ckpo{int p:redict:s a peak of vi[sitors t[o Hong Kong on October 1 and 2.
The reporter saw at the arri(val lobby around 7:00 a.~m. o]n October 1 that many mainland t;o;urists took ad,vantag,e o+f the National Day Golden Week, to take the h+igh-+spee+d rail and visit Hon'g Kong.
Mr\s Song with light-footedness told th?e repor]ter that the National Da^y holiday was a rare long holiday in a year . It has alway+s be=e=n her wish to come to the G+old+e+n Bauhinia Squa,re in Hong Kong to watch the flag-raising ceremony . S#he felt very h.a.ppy and excited to be able t;o accomplish this will on National Da,y.
But currently, the flights b\e\tw\ee\n Ningxia and Hong Kong a!re inconvenient . Thanks to th"e opening of the high-speed rai.lway for t^he Hong Kong segment . Mr So{ng checked t,he train schedule and found that th?e first train could arriv"e at 7:&03 a.m., and i;t was perfect timing for taking urban transportation m/ea/ns to the Golden Ba*uhinia Square.
He told t#h#e reporters, "the hig-h-speed railway is very convenient, fa's't and on time! `>`
Th"e 70 daily one-hour short-haul trains running between Guangzhou South, Shen{z{hen North, Futian and W;est Kowloon greatly facilitated t|h|e residents i=n Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Great$er Ba+y Area to visit Hong Kong.
Aft!er arriving in Hong Kon]g, Mr Liu, who lived i^n S"hen"zhen, wa[s prep^ari^ng to join his Hong K;o;ng friends at the top of a hill in Central.
Mr Liu said, "both th-e mainland a^nd Ho[ng Kong have holidays on National Day . W|e in&tend t.o challenge ourselves an=d see if we can compl(et(e walking the 50-kilometer Hong Kong Trail! "
He explained that they would no*t dare to make such a lo:ng tre_k withou>t the convenience an-d sufficient time b(roug(h(t about by the high-speed railway.
M/rs Ya*n*g, who came from Dongguan, took her 10-year-old son t_o come to Hong Kong to participate in th}e piano competition by taking th%e high-speed railway . She proudly t&ol&d t+h+e reporter that her son had bee'n studying piano for three year%s, and it was ver}y meaningful t-o spend the National Day in this w_a_y.
Sh=e had previously come to Hong Ko-n-g b"y b&us, b*ut it was time,-c,onsum,i,ng and laborious . She was worried about affecting her son's condition . This time s?he came from Shenzhen by high-speed railway . The customs cle)arance was convenient and the ti*me w]as reduced by half . She wa?s mo:r:e impressed b~y the tri$p in Hong Kong segment . S.h.e to@l@d the re:porter, "it seems like taking the subway, which is very fa!st . I am not ab\l\e to do take photos before arriving! "
At 6:44 a.m. on S'eptem'ber 23, the G5711 "Harmony" high-speed tr#ain depart`ed fr+om Shenzhen North Railway St,at,ion and sped all th?e way . A fe*w minu>tes later, the train entered the Hong Kong segment o^f Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link . Th=is was th*e fi\rst formally operated high-speed train in the Hong Kong segment.
The Hong Kon/g segment of the h}igh-s}pee}d railway, which integrates the na<tion<al 25,000-kilometer high-speed ra!il netw.or.k and reaches 3[8 long-distance st{at{ions throughout the country, also welcomes mainland tourists from different provinces far a.p.art from each other.
Mr Gao, who took a_dv_a_nt_age o)f minor vacation to visit relatives in Hong Kong from Changsha, told th\e reporter tha[t previously, the high-speed railway could only tra,v,e,l to Shenzhen North, and he needed to t*ake th}e su=bway to pass throu<gh Hong Kong, and then ta_k_e urban tran|sport|a|tion means . I}t was tro%uble%s%om%e and time-consuming to make transfers . N"ow, he can travel d|irectly t}o the center of Kow,loon and have lu+nch which was made by his children when getting home . He felt very ha\ppy.
He said that the `[` one port and two immigration i^nspec^tion '"' customs clearance procedure were ve?ry convenient beyond imagination, an;d "passing bo[t[h customs within 10 minutes. "
The We;st Kowloon Station, which i[s close to t^he Airport Express and connects land and a/i/r traffic, has also become the preferred destination fo'r many trans,it passengers.
Miss Wu, from Fuj-ian Province, prepared to spend the Golden W]eek with her friends traveling from Ho:ng K@ong to Philippines . Pushing he/r luggage out o%f the gate on time in Wes]t Kowloo,n, she told the reporter w%itho%ut hesitation, "I was afr^aid of not catching up wit$h the plane, but I did n'>t think it would be s@o fast and that was mo;r;e than enou&gh! "
According to the subsidiary arr;a;ngement o\f th)e trade agreement published on Monday, the ne{w U.S:. -Mexico-Canada trade agreement will r~etain the President Tru[mp's ability t)o implement the threat to impose a 25% tar[iff on imported cars, while essentially exempting pas+seng+er cars, pick|up trucks and auto parts imported from Canada an~d Mexico from paying tariffs.
If T@rump i+mpos+es a so-called "Chapter 232" tariff on cars for national security reasons, Mexico and Ca}nada will have a tax-exempt quota of 2.<6 milli<on pass-en-g-e-r cars exported to the Unit'e'd States e(ac(h year.
According t!o the subsidiary arrangement, the pickup trucks man:ufa:ctured in both countries will b;e fully exempted from tar&iffs.
If Trump imposes auto tariffs, Mexico wil|l re.ceive a tax exemption quota of $108 bi;ll;ion each ye]ar for a-u-t-o p`arts, and Can-ada will receive a quota of $32.4 billion.
These t,w,o quotas are far higher than the c`u`r`rent p&roduct&ion levels of the two coun#tr#ies, and provi&de their exports with growth space.
Report of Reuters on S'eptember 2#8 in Wash(in(gton/Me(xi(co: M#exi#co sa(id on Friday that after days of deb?a?tes, the U.S. President Trump's government and C&anad&a were makin%g real efforts to resolve trade poli'c'y differences, raising hopes that the North American Fr]e]e Tra?de Agreement (NAFTA) would maintain the form of a tripartite agr<ee<men<t.
Despite lack of details, the obvious progress mentioned above is enough t?o prompt the Mexican a`nd American governments to abruptly stop publishing th\e t~e~xt o]f the two-party trade agree]m]en]t and gi_ve Canada mo're time to join the agreement.
Andr\es M}anuel Lopez O`brador, th]e Mexican president-elect, told the reporters in Mexico that the U.S. go:vernm:ent had m~ade new counter-proposals to the Canadian government and said he would continue to urge these three cou<ntri<es to part{icipate in NAFT,A.
Ildefonso Guajardo, th`e Mexican Minis>t>er of Economic Affairs, s=aid the time f#or submitting the tex`t o@f th(e US-Mexico trade agreement to the legislation departments of Mexico and the United States had b)ee)n delayed bec?ause the Canadian an;d American governments tried to reach an agreement `[` very seriously".
Gua~j~ardo said, "I[n the next 4?8 hours, we will know whether we wi_ll ge?t a text of a tripartite agreement o!r have to publish the t.e.xt of the two-party agreement. "
Guajardo said that the officials at th-e s*ame level in the U.S. and Canada ha'd "spec~i~a~l re?qu?e?sts" to postpone to pub;lish the text.
The spokesman of the Office of the Un"i"ted States Trade Representative (USTR) did n{ot co)mmen)t on the text o\f th|e bilateral tr"ade agreement be!tween the United States an#d Mexico and the negotiations b"etwee"n the United States and Canada.
Off]ici]als o;f the P_rim_e Minister's Offi*ce and th;e Office of Minister for Foreign Affairs of Canada did not r&es&pond to requests for comment on the counter-proposal.
A`ccording to foreign media reports, it was hard for people t\o find anything unu@s@u@al in t#w#o little lions playing in a conservation cen}ter located in t(he suburb in Pretoria, the capital o]f South Africa, but th'ey were absolutely uniqu%e.
University of Pretoria announced: "They are the firs(t lions in the history, which are born by artific"i"al insemination -;- the fi&rst pair o)f li`ons in the world. `_`
The scientists of th-e university were c&o&m&mittin&g the]mse]lves to studying the reproductive sy<st<em of female African lions.
Ganswindt, the d=irector of Mammal In)stitu)te of University of Pretoria, sai[d that these tw]o little l>io>ns born on A/ug/ust 25 were a femal\e lion and a male lion . They were pretty healthy and quite norma*l.
Af@t@e@r the intensive tests i-n 18 months, h.is team finally made this breakthrough.
G]answindt said i!n a media interview: "We collected the s?pe?rm?s from a healthy male lion{. "
Next, th:e r}esear}ch}ers w<ait<ed for the hormones in the female lion to reach a p<rope<r level so a,s to conduct the artificial insem=ina=tion in it.
Ganswindt said: `;` Fortunately, th@e res>ul>t turned out to be successful. "
He said t\hat t+h+e researchers "tried many times, b@ut t@o their surprise, it didn't take m=uch effort".
H'e said that the above-mentioned research breakthrough could be verified rep{eatedl{y, and the scientists hoped to use th:is te]c]hnolog]y to save t)he endangered big ca?ts.
The International Union for C&o&n&serva&tion of Nature indicated that th~e lion had already become extinct in 2#6 A$f$rica$n countries, and the t'otal number of su?rv?i?val wild lions had declined sharpl@y by 43% i=n the pas_t 20 years with only about 20,000 w:il:d lions left.
T:h:e African lion was listed as vul\nerable b+y this organization.
Ganswindt sa`id: "This animal will b+e in danger of extinction i(f w|e do nothing for them. "
He said that with this kind of new techno-logy, it '*s no>t necessary for the lions to be f~ed . The sperm%s cou)l)d be injected into the b)odies of female lions, just l$ike the approach adopting o%n the elephants i?n captivity in North America and Europe.
The exports of South Korea fell th(e most i]n more than tw'o yea&rs in September, but anal&ysts put the blame of the decline on fewer working days and said t,hat although t&he trade tension between China and th+e United States rose, the global d`em`a`nd for Sout$h Korean goods remained s~trong.
Indeed, the average daily exports o>f S!outh Korea incr+e+ased last month.
Moreover, t!he initial value data released earlier show+ed that the exports in f"i"rst wee"ks of September during the long vacation ha'd a double-digit in|c|rease.
The year-on-year drop of S=outh Korean exports i,n September was the largest since July 201{6, which wa$s more than the decrease of 5.7% estimated by 11 analys,ts o/f Reuters su*rveys.
T'he initial value released on Monday sh{owe{d that the amount o(f exports in September was $50].6 billion, lowe-r than $51.2 b?i?l?li?on in August.
Although the C(hina-(US trade disputes with intensifying concerns m@ig@ht cause other neig{hbori{ng countri+es of China which depend?e?d on ex:por:ts to su[ffer, Korean exports to China i$n September increased by 7.8%, expanding for the 23rd consecutive month.
Since the sales of oil p,ro,ducts declined, K}o}r}ean exp<ort<s to Ame.ri.ca decreased by 11.8%.
Although the ma?rket worried that t:he so-called `_` su(p(ercy(cle '.' of chips might reach the peak, the overseas s+al+e+s of K:o:r:ean memory chi.ps and oil products increased by 28.3% and 13.5% respectively.
"However, the influen(ce of trade conflicts c'an not be av[oi[ded, because Korean exports considerably depend o(n America!n and Chinese markets. "
The i`mpor`ts decreased b~y 2].1% to $40.8 bi%llion, inferior to the increase of 3.1% estimated by the Reu(t(ers survey.
The initial value of trade surpl<us in September was $9<.7 bi)l)l)io)n, higher than $6.9 billi'on i-n August.
The De\pa\rtment of Industry said that thanks to America and the E|U countries, the globa*l manufacturing would maintain b@uoyant, which was a fav!orable factor for Korean expo!rts.
The statement point"ed out, `*` t)h)e inc:reasing export price caused by the rise of the oil price will be be%neficial to the exports i[n t>he second half of this year. "
`'` However, the t#r#ade conflict between the U.nited States a%nd China continues and the market fluctuation after rising U^.^S. interest rates intensifies, which a:re both negative pre&ssure on exports. "
The average exports of each wo_rk_ing day in September increased t&o $2.6 billion, while t+he amount i<n August was $2.1 bi;lli;on.
The Mid-Autumn F*est*iv*a*l in South K"o"re"a this year was from September 24-]26 so th?a?t there were only 19.5 working days in September, four days les/s tha!n t{he same period last year.
T<he Ko>rean e(xports from January to September increased by 4%.%7% compared with that of the same per,iod last year.
According t>o the Nikkei/Markit Purchasing Managers In,dex, activities of Korean manufacturing rose again in September w`h`ich wa%s supported by domestic orders, sin}ce Chinese and Japanese orde=rs declined, which would probab`l`y cast a shadow over export pros"pec"ts.
North Korean m&e&dia criticized th$e United States for not easing th|e sanctions on North Ko,re,a.
North Korea's "Rodong Shinmu.n" published a signatured review article o>n S~ept~em~b~er 3.0 to criticize the United Sta"tes for not eas?in?g the sanctions on No&rth Korea while s?eekin?g to have a dialogue with North Korea . The article said that i}t was a "self-cont>radic>tor>y" action.
T\h\e article said that Pompeo, the United States Secretary of State, indicated on September 1[4 that "t[he ke]y to achieve t:he denuclearization of th^e Ko_rean Peninsula was to i+mpose the sanction@s o]n North Korea" to emphasize that the United States would keep its position on implementing th/e UN resolution t?o impose sanctions.
In the North Korea-US Joint Statement of Si>ngapore, the two sides promised to buil&d a new Nor"t"h Korea-US relation, which complied with t@h@e t\wo peoples' wishes of look#ing forw|ar|d t_o peace and prosperity.
O`n on}e side, the United Sta_t_es in!c!rea!sed the intensity of s.anct.ions, but on the other side, it asked for the dialogue . Undoubtedly, it_s action:s were self-contradictory.
According to the article, if it wanted to bu=ild a new No=rt=h Korea-US r.el.ation, e^stabl^is^h a permanently consolidated s;ystem of peace in the Korean Peninsula, an(d achieve the denuclearization of th$e Korean Peninsula, i,t w\ould put building trust in the first p}lace, start from what c%an be done, a(n(d solve the problems by s]tag]es.
The art>ic>le also said th{at the United States should understand th)at it wouldn't work t+o impose sanctions on Nort/h Korea.
The article s*aid tha{t even the "Severodvinsk '&' preceded the "Kazan" wa{s admired by t#he U.S. military.
Th]e National I'nte're'st quotes the view of US Navy as saying, "w]e w^ill encounter a stro]ng pot|e|nt|ial opponent . I=t is enough to see the "Severodvinsk" submarine only. "
Foggo, t-h-e current commander in chief of the U#.#S. navy in Europe, a?lso highly praised the "Seve}rodvinsk '(' submarine.
He s$aid, "t:his submarine i)s impressive . Look at th]e development of Russian navy a]nd how they uti#l#i#z#e resources and it will be known that their main efforts o!n t~he f+ields of research and development are firstly to strenghten the submarine fleet. "
However, the National Interest st+i+ll considers the United States maintains the advantage ag\ainst Russ=ia in th)is field.
Foggo sai}d, "I believe that western countries still hav:e asymmetrical a@d@vantages. "
Previously, i)t was informed that the Russian navy would equip the `"` Kaz|an" submarine in 20,19.
The multipurpose submarines of "Kazan '|', `|` Novosibirsk", "Krasnoyarsk" and "Arkhangelsk" are all of "Fraxinus-M" improved type, with displacement of 13,800 t`o`ns, depth of 520 m, s`ta`ffi`n`g o)f 64, submerged speed o\f 31 knots .

Ignore the Threat o?f Ame,ri,ca!
EU may Reach Crude O(il Purc_ha_se Agreement with Iran
Th}e US g,overnmen,t announced that it will restart a new r:o:und of sanctions against Iran in November and even ur<g<e other countries t>o reduc|e imports of Iran oil.
However, the A+mer+ican allies di-d no,t seem to take the advice.
According t^o the US "New York Times", on 29th, during the in-te-rview, Z%arif, Foreign Minister of Iran, revea]led t&h&at altho>u>gh the U,nited States thr{eate{n{ed to san)ction a,ny country th{at does business with Iran, Tehran is approaching to reach an agreement on the sal~e of crude oil with EU.
T#he core purpose of this agreement is to try to establ.ish a new payment mechanism, wh!ic!h i[s t.o replace the dollar transaction in the form of barter or d`om`estic c?urrenc?y.
The purpose of this approach is to bypass the United States a^nd prevent the Unit~ed States fr[om i.mpeding financial transfer!s.
Meanwhile, although the EU i"s working on facilitating the ag#reemen#t, s,ome French and Brit_ish officials a~r~e also worried that if th<e agreement is concluded, it wi]ll be the most overt confrontatio!n between the EU and the United States against the US withdrawal f$r$om th_e Iran nuclear de{al.
The U'S media said tha^t in the one hour interview, Zarif ’ s words sounded m,or,e optimistic than in rec-ent mont?h?s.
Bec'a'u'se the agreement c"an "strip '(' t$he traditional American allies and e_ffective_ly break the US ’ s attempts to cut Iran ’ s inc!om!e.
"This can guarantee that we can sell oil and obtain benefits", Zarif bel`i`eved . According t(o the agreement reac/hed in 2,015, eac-h country has t@he legal rights t}o make trade contac_ts with Iran.
The h~ead of Union f-or Foreign Affairs Policy, Federica Mogherini, also said re=centl=y that "no sovereign state or organization can ac&cept other people to decide w`ho they can trade w*it*h*. `)`
However, she also predicted that before the U;S government carried out t;h;e n=ext step of sanctions in N=ovember, US leaders could a'dop't a series o\f f#inanci#al i-nstrum-e-nt-s aimed at banks, businessmen and countries that have commercial intercourses w=ith Tehran.
In May of this yea@r, the US government unilaterally announc`e`d its withdrawal from the I;ran nuclear deal on t}he grounds that t_h_e agreement had deficiencies, saying t+hat the agree,me,nt could n_ot permanently prohibit Iran from producing nucl+ear fuel.
The US then threatened t(o ba*n companies that buy Iran oil and other c{ommo{dities f'ro'm doing business i+n the United States.
This threat forced some companies to leave Tehran a_nd m(ad(e the Iranian cur}rency d\ropp\ed sharply.
Companies such as Airbu's S.A>.S . a{n{d French o/il giant Total have cancelled billions of dollars i|n investment in Iran.
British and F^rench off\icials sai/d, the U]S government may "take the lead".
Unsurprisingly, according t"o a recent report by t<he Turkish media, t>he US sanctions did not se"em to ha!v!e a major impact on Iran ’ s o%il exports.
Recently, Iran Oil M`inist`er Zanganeh d?isclose?d t(h(a(t no country other than South K|orea has stopped buying Iran oil.
Both Zarif and Ira_n President Rouhani believed th(at the pu,rpose of a series o|f US actions is t:o "seduce" Iran ’ s breach of t)he agreement.
Zarif also regarded the US ser}ial blast a@s not worthy of consideration . W)hen ask'ed if the US would ove(rthr(ow the current Iranian go~vernm~en~t with increasing financial pressure, Zarif even laughed . "It is a regime change strategy, a$nd this is t^he tr:ue purpo>se o~f the US. "

Ac]c]ord]ing t)o the "Core Information on Health Education o@f Chinese Adolescents and Interpretation (2018 version)" released by th\e Nation%al He"alth Commission recently, t`he key to maintain a healthy wei=ght was the rational diet and s!cient!ific movement.
The o[ve[rwe[igh[t, obesity and bl$ind weight r>e>du>c>tio>n were harmful to health.
Th$e healt{h hazard behind the `:` chubby children" couldn't be ignored.
Ding Gangqiang, the head o/f National Institute for Nutrition and Health of Chinese Center for Disea's'e Control and Preven:ti:on, said that overweight-obesity could har'm th=e adolescents' normal growth a+nd de+vel+opme+nt, hav@e a negative imp|act on their mentality, behavior, cognition and intelligence, and even c*ause hypertension, hyperglycemia and hype\rlipid\e\mia in childre}n.
And the adolescents' overweight-obesity might continue into adulthood, which woul?d increase the adoles/c/e/nts' risk of ha.ving ch_r_onic diseases, su#ch a~s hypertension a$nd diabetes in their adulthood.
Ding Gangqiang s<aid that the overweight rate was 9.6% and the ob=es=ity rate was 6?.4% amo(n(g Chinese children and adolescents of 6-17 years old accordin=g to the Nutrition and Healt\h Status Inspection o*f Chinese Residents i!n 2010-20>1>2 . T!h!e sum of these two rates was 16%.
Meanwhile, the characteris|tics of overweight-obesity among children and a*dolesce*nts w[e[r[e that t.he overweight-ob`esity rate w[a[s higher in boys than in girls, and it was higher i"n cities than in villages . The overweight-obesity rate h)ad significantly increased in recent decade@s.
Ho~w would the adolescents deal with t/he overweight-obesity?
Zhang Li, the d/eputy d:irecto:r of Science Fitness and Health Promotion Research Center of General Ad(m(inistra(tion o|f Sport o$f China, ind*ic*a*ted that the primary caus^es of adolescent obesity at pr@e@sent were excessive caloric intake a%n%d inadequate physical activity.
Fo]r this kind of simple obesity, we should lay emphas>is o&n scientific movement and reasonable die+t control.
Zhang Li pointed out that the mo\s\t important concept t_o maintain a healthy weight was th-e "preventive treatment o(f disease", a[nd an i#nteg#ra#l part of it w&as to conduct the all-round science popularization educati)on of schools, parents an(d students, popularize the dangers o(f over]weight a{nd obesity, and increase the adolescents' self-protection awareness.
The adolescents should take the periodic physical examination to monitor the growth and development index, suc{h as he"ight and wei<ght, s,o that the p<roblems o#f overweight and obesity co?uld be discovered early and determined scientifically to take intervention measures i,n ti.me.
For those adolescents wh-o are already ove$rweig$ht and obese, Ding Gangqiang advised that s[tarvation therapy o;r semi-starvation therapy should b&e avoided to control a#nd lose weight in add$i$tion t$o the active an:d scientific arran#gement of diet and movement since the adolescents are in a special physiological stage . They should not take drugs blindly t,o lose wei:gh:t.

China News Service, Yichang, Oct)obe)r 1 (repo(r(ted by Guo Xiaoying an:d Liu Min) -`- The newly revised "Three Gorges-Gezhou>ba Hydro Project Navigation Scheduling Regulation" (hereinafter r:efer:red t*o as `#` Scheduling R`egula`t`ion") w%as officially enforced starting from October 1 . After two years of naviga|ti|on t`est, the Three Gorges ship lift was of#f#icially scheduled together with the navigation l,o,c,k in a unified w`ay.
O'n the first da$y o.f enf>orcing the new regulations, the navigation i+n Three Gorges-Gezhouba waters was in good order.
Three Gorges Navigati?on Authority released the first plan of se&c&uri&t&y check at 21:00 on September 30, and carried o|ut the securit|y c|hec|k on 1.60 ships, with 1#24 ships passing the security check.
The navigation authority arranged th-e first locking plan afte-r the enforcement o"f new r}egu}lation}s at 14:00 o*n October, 1.
After the e'nf'orceme'nt o/f new regulations, the plan of security check wou'l'd be released once every day at 9:00 an~d 2<1:00, and the plan of passing dam wo`uld be relea@se@d once ev[ery day at 14:00 and 20:00, so that the ships co<u<ld flexibly arrange the plan o(f passing d{am.
T&he `\` Classification Control '#' schedu@ling principle of sh%ip passing dam w}as added in th!e "Scheduling Regulation". The priority of ship passing dam would be determ-ined according t#o the fu(nctional localization o&f navigation lock and ship lift respectively . The short-term passenger ship passing dam would be adjusted to be i?n the same priority as the demonstration ship and integrity shi[p.
This i[s al<so th[e official scheduling of ship lift and navigation l{o{ck after the two-year navigation test of ship l#i#ft.
I|t was al+so the first time for bi`g length-width demonstration shi[p a'nd new energy driven ship of Chuanjiang River and Th,ree Gorges Reservoir Region to b&e ranked in the priority.
At the sa^me time, the "navigation scheduling management waters" were adj_u_st_ed fro[m t-he 180-kilometer waters close t@o dam to the 541.8-kilometer waters from Yunyang Yangtze River Bridge to Shis<hou Yangtze River Bridge i*n the "Scheduling Regulation ')' . And th;e "co~re waters", `*` water clos;e to dam", "control w(at(ers" a!nd "scheduling waters" were divided.
This a}ction wo%uld help the sh*ip choose the proper water[s t)o wait fo/r crossing the lock, avoiding excessive ships waiting for crossing the lock in the dam region.
The "Sched$u$l$ing Regulation" also pu.t forward the meas{ure{s of integrity constraint for the rule-breaking ships according to the cu(rren(t characteristics of s,hip passing da*m and waiting fo|r crossing lock, s:uch as canceling the declaration and delaying t#he time of passing dam fo*r 24 hours.
After water storing of the T$hree Gorges, the na~v~igat~ion condition of t"he reservoir a/rea was improved, ac(c(elerati(ng the rapid development of shipping i*n Yangtze River.
According t?o data, the annual ca+rg+o t*hrou*g*h*pu*t o^f Three Gorges ship lock an`d Gezhouba ship lock was increased from 34.3 million tons in 2004 to 0.138 billion tons and 0.14 billi.on to?n?s in 2017 r?espec?tiv?ely.
During the two-]year navigation tes*t o<f ship lift, 5767 ships and 0.1622 million people have pas"s"ed, and the volume of goods transported was 1.7128 mil;l;ion to>n>s.
Che<n Dongyuan, the d)e)pu)ty director o@f Three Gorges Navigation Author>ity, said that the "Scheduling Regulation" p_laye_d an active role in promoting the m;anage;me;nt of c`ros`sing lock in an hon(es(t way, relieving th;e pressure o)f ships waiting for crossing t{he lock i,n the dam region, and improving the navigation capacity.

Signed a+nd approved by Premier Li Keqiang, t%h%e State Council printed and di-stri-buted the `*` Decision of the Sta<te Council on Further Reducing the Categories in the Catalogue of In^dustrial Products Subject to Pr%od%u%ctio%n License Administration and Simpli'fying the Approval Procedures '-'.
The "Decision '%' proposed t@o further reduce the categories i|n the catalogue of industrial p.rod.ucts subject to production lice~nse adminis_tra_tion, cancel the production li,cense administ@ration for 14 industrial products, and delegate the administration authority f_or production licenses o+f 4 types o/f industrial products to the quality a+nd technical supervision departments of provincial people ’ s governments.
After this reform, t{h{e products that implement the industrial product production licenses adminis'tra'tion will b(e reduced fro!m last year ’ s 3{8 categories to the c!u!rre!nt 24 categories.
The "Dec~ision" clearly simplifies the approval process for pr]o]duc]t]s i+n the catalogue.
First, t&he pre-ce%rt%if%ication product inspection organized by the issuing authori+ty is changed to the product inspection c?onfor?mi?ty report iss&u&ed by the qualified i>nspection and test'i'ng institution when the enterprise applies.
Second, i{n addi&tion to dangerous chemicals, the products that have been licensed by the quality and techn=ical supervision department (market supervision and man?age?ment department) o!f the provincial people ’ s government s:hall b}e subject to post-:sit:e i|nspec|tion . After the enterprise submits the application and pr'odu'ct inspection conformity report and ma)k)es a commitment to ensure p(roduct quality and safety, th_e production license can b%e o_b_taine_d after passing the formal examination, and then th!e on-s^i^t^e examin+at+io+n is accepted within the specified time.
Third, for enterprises produce different types o.f products i}n t-he production and operation ca_talogue, in accordance with the princip_le of `$` one enterprise, one license '{', when app"ly fo}r a new license or apply for a lice#nse renewal, a license s;hould be issued and examined.
The "Decision" requ"ires that all regions and relevant departments shou{ld solidly prom^o^te the reduction of catalogue and s!imp!li!fy t-h-e examination and approval pr!oce!du!r!e!s.
Increase the commitment publicity of enterprises and post-site inspection work, strengthen credit supervision an]d restraint mean;s, implement the respons$i$bi$li$ty of t%h%e m>ain body o%f the enterprise, and revoke the prod<uction license for false pro%mises and non-compliance.
For th"e produ}c}t}s that c$ancel the prod?u?ct?ion licenses administration f)o)r indu/strial products, i)t i;s necessary t|o strengthen th{e post s(u(p(e(rvisio(n, and the products related to public health a!n!d safety, env"ironme"nta"l prot|ec|tion, etc . can be con)ver)te)d into compulsory certification, list positive lists and publicize to the publ?ic, unify the certification standards and reasonably reduce and merge the certification and testing items, a:nd the compulsory certi(fication fees in principle should be borne by the financial institutions at all levels.
Tak+e support measures to encourage enterprises t?o carry out voluntary certification an_d promote bra'nd building and market expansion.
It is necessary to b)enchmark the i$nternationa$l advanced stan`dards and promote th,e quality of industrial products.
Give full play to the r%o%l%e of third-party social organ[iz[at[ions to ensure th'e quality an'd safety of industrial products.
Fo^r products that retain industrial produ>ct production license administration, it is necessary to impro`ve the standard sy*s*te*m, give play to the advantages of industry supervision, strengthe)n the responsibility of "w_h_o approves and w"ho su[pe[rvise", dynamically assess product qua'li'ty and safety risks, timely re^duce catalogues, d(eleg(at(e approval authority o^r convert t]o certification administration.
China ’ s compreh}ens}ive PMI in S$ep$tembe$r having a month-{on-mo{nth increase, an!d the manufacturing PMI fe:l:l back from the previous month.
Accordi.ng to da}ta released by the National Bure(au of Statistics o.n the 30th, China ’ s co|mp|re|h|e|nsi|ve PMI output index was 5`4.1% in Sep%tember, higher than the prev/ious month and the annu%al average of 0.3 and 0.1 percentage points, indicating that the over&all production and o$peration activities of Chinese enterprises remain}e}d stable.
In the same month, the manufacturing production index an/d t\he non-manufacturing business activi!ty index, which constitute the comprehensive PMI out-put i^ndex, were 5=3.=0% and 54.9%, respectively, with on`e decrease an!d one increase.
Among them, China ’ s manuf'acturing PMI w*as 5|0.8%, falling back 0.5 percentage points from t_he previous mo+nth.
Zh/ao Qingh_e sai.d that this month ’ s manufacturing PMI has five main characteristics:
Fir%st, the fundamentals o[f the manufacturing industry are generally sta#b#l#e.
Among t/he 21 surveyed i'nd'ustr'ies, the PMIs of 14 industries are in the expansion range . The manufacturing PMI o>f pha_r_maceut_icals, special equipmen|t an'd electrical machinery equipment ar$e al`l at a higher operating level of 53.5%, an$d the g.rowth rate is faster.
Seco|nd, supply an]d demand have slight fluctuation.
The prod{uction index an|d the new orders index were 5"3."0% an)d 52.0%, respectively, with a de$crease of 0!.3 and an increase of 0.2 percentage points from the previous mon#th . Supply an>d demand continued to maintain a good state, bu|t the expansion slo-w-ed slightly.
The n)ew export or.de.rs ind_ex a+n+d i~mport i]ndex were 48.0% and 48.5%, respectively 1.4 and 0.6 percentage points lower than the previous month, and the boom degree fell to the l%ow of th.e year.
Fourth, the cost of pur+chas+i+n+g raw m~at~er~ials for enterprises ha\s increased.
The purchase price i.n.dex o:f major raw materials w?as 5\9.8%, with an i]nc]rea]se of 1.1 percentage from the previous month, and the ex-factory price index was 5>4.3%, which was the s[ame as last month, both were a^t high points duri|ng the yea:r.
Fifth, large-scale enterprises are r/un/n/ing steadily, an)d t<he business conditions o[f small enterprises continue to improve.
The PMI o}f large enterprises was 52.1%, which wa+s the s`a`me as that o}f the pr)evious month . Since t>h>i>s yea\r, the index has been in the expansion range o$f 52.0% and a"bo"ve, and the production i<nd<ex and the new order index have b?o?t?h inc"rea"sed this month, which is the main driv[in[g force for the expansion of the manufacturing industry . Th&e PMI of medium-sized enterprises was 48.7%, which w"as 1.$7 percentage lower than the previous m[o[nth and w$a$s in th&e contraction range . Th?e PMI of small enterprises was 50.)4%, which was 0.4 per^c^ent^ag^e higher t$han that of th\e previous month and rose for two consecutive months.
In the same month, China ’ s no>n-ma>nufactu>ri>ng business activity i#n#dex was 54.9 percent, w(i(th an increase of 0.=7 percentage from t\he previous month and incre-a-sed for tw)o consecutive months.
Zhao Qinghe b}el}ieves that the non-manufacturing industry will continue t_o maintain a stable a(nd g>o>od development momentum.
The business activity index o;f ro)ad tr*a*nsp*ort, se}curit}y, real estate and oth`e`r industries continued t"o b'e lower than the critical point, and the total business volume also decreased.
Report o%f Reuters on November 5 in Nagoya: Haruhiko Kuroda, the president of the Bank of Japan said on Monday th)at the bank realized t/h/at the long-term implementation of ultra-easing mon%etary po,l,i,c,y could squeeze the prof:it margins o\f financi`al institutions and destabilize t+he banking system o&f Japan.
However, he s|aid that due t"o the low inflation and uncertainty in overseas economies, the Bank o.f Japan needed t+o maintain its large-scale incentive p%lans and pay close attention t.o the p^r^os and cons o~f its policies.
`^` The Bank of Japan fully acknowledges t.hat u]n]der t/he su%staine%d mon.et.ary easing policy, the strength of financial institutions will be increasingly affected," Haruhiko Kuroda said i]n a speech to the business leade>rs in Nagoya.
H+e said th-at if financial ins\t\it\uti\o\ns were more active in taking risks to compensate for t&h&e effect of low interest rates on shrinking p%rof%it margins over th?e years, t[he banking system co`uld be unstable in the e<vent of serious negative impacts.
"Although these risks are not too bi{g a#t present, the Bank o$f Jap@an wi]ll closely monitor the development of the situation and encourage f]ina]nc]ial institutions t_o take necessary measures," he s|ai|d.
The minutes rel^eased by the Bank of Japan earlier on Monday showed t-hat the policy committee of the Ba~nk o]f Jap|an discus.sed the problem of rising costs of the long-term easing policy a!t the interest ra_te meeting in September.
The minutes showed tha}t a membe}r o_f the board s|aid that if the economy continued to expand, "the Bank o+f Japan wil|l hav}e more flexibility in the aspect of policy in the futu.re. "
The m$i$nutes sho|wed that another member of the board said th&at due to the limi;ts of p(o(licy duration, the committee should discuss how long t?he Bank of J?ap?an can maintain the incentive policy.
Haruhiko Kuroda said that the Bank of Japa!n would a[ss[ess the financial risks brought by the easing policy, an"d t[ake into account the uncertainties cent#er#ed on Japan's economic prospects, as China-U.S. trade frictions and r&i&sin&g protect'i'o'nism might affect t%he global dema'nd.
"The impact of such problems on J]ap]a]n's econ(om(y i[s temporarily limited, '>' Haruhiko Kuroda said.
"But if the problem persists, t'he impact o)n Japan's econom{y may increase, '.' he added.
"It is necessary to su!st!ain the strong monetary e~asing polic@y an(d consider both positive and negative impact,s i~n a balanced manner," Haruhiko Kuroda said.
Alt(ho(ugh th@e disadvantages o$f radic&a&l incentive plans were increas(ing, such as long-term l+ow interest rates eroding the profits of financial institutions, t<he low inf+lation forced the Bank of Japan to maintain the plan.
Th<e Bank of Japan maintained the monetary pol`icy last month; Haruhiko Kuroda ru#led ou!t the possibility of recent interest rate increase about the risks brought by the conflict o|f the globa$l trade w#ar.
O>n J$une 1, 2018, in Cardif$f, the United States, the corporate identity o(n Tesla elec=t=ric cars.
According to a settlement agreement, Tesla M!o!to!rs and i>ts CEO, Musk, had agreed to separately pa-y $20 million f>in>es t/o the financial regul#a#to#rs, and Musk would resign as President of the company, b<ut stil`l held the p%o%st o?f CEO.
Thi&s settl=ement agreement would end two months of unrest in Te>sla.
This settlement agreement on securities f}raud charge releas}e}d by th@e U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SE_C) on Saturday would make inv^estors relieved.
Investors were originally worried that the protracted legal bat;tle would onl-y further hit t[he electric car compa-ny, which w]a]s still losing money.
SE`C prosecuted Musk for frau&ds o*n Thursday, saying that his tweet on August 7 misled the in.ves.tors.
The tweet sa_id that h,e was considering to priv<atize Tesla with $420 per share a*nd had obtained financing.
SEC said that these tweets ac$tually had no evidenc'es a;n;d th;e volatility in market triggered by them had h\urt investors.
Investors and corporate governance experts said that this agreement co(ul(d strengthen Tesla, wh%ich ha*d been hi+t hard b+y Musk's recent actions.
Steven Heim, t_h_e leader of assets management company of Boston Common, said that this settlemen!t agreement should let M|usk rece/ive more monitoring, b*ut ha'd no<t taken any "destructive" measures to throw him out o/f Te&sl&a.
This assets management company he@ld shares of P_an_as_oni_c, the battery m.anufactu.rer of Tesla.
Acc@ording to this proposed agreem"ent, Tesla must appoint a independent pr'e'sident, t)wo independent d@ire@c@to@rs a|nd a board committee to s%et out controls aiming at Musk ’ s external communications.
`"` This mat+te+r was resolved promptly according to the agreed conditions, whi;c;h me[t th|e best interests of our mark%et an<d our investors, including Tesla shareholders," S|EC Chairman Clayton said in a statement.
The charge on Thursday caused the mar+ket value o_f T*esla evapor*ate about $7 billio*n . T}he market value of this company was $45.2 billion, lower than $47.5 bi+llion of G-eneral Motors.
SEC withdrew th;e requirement for throwi}ng Musk out of the he?ad po$si$tion of the company.
Man-y investors said that thi?s punishment would be catastrophic.
"I think it is t+h+e best possible result f*or all relevant s:t:aff," Ivan Feinseth from Tigress Financial Partners sa)id . Feinseth gave a `~` neutral ']' evaluati>on to Tesla a^nd s;a;id tha\t the punishment of SEC was a "lighter punishment" to Musk.
"The fact that h]e still holds the p~o~si~ti~on of C*EO is very important to Tesla:. "
Neither Musk nor Tesla admitted or denied th}e charge of SE|C in t_he settlement agreement, or imme%d%iate%ly r(eplied to the request for commenting.
T{h{e settlement agreement still neede/d t*o get approval of the court.

Chin-a ’ s President Xi Jinping sai|d on Mond$ay that China's opening door w[ould not be closed, but wou`ld only open wider and wider, and the pace for pr=omot=ing a higher level o{f openness would n(ot st)op.
The expanded import was not a makeshift, but t=he long-term consideration facing the future . It wa!s estimated that the good&s and services imported t{o China would e"xc"ee"d $30 trillion an~d $1}0 trillion respectively in the next 1:5 yea^r^s.
Xi Jinping de=livere=d a keynote speech at the first China Intern>at>i>on>al Import Expo and said that China would further reduce tariffs, speed u?p the development of cross-border e-commerce and other new typ*es of business, co"ntinu"e to bro!aden market access, promote the o?pening of the service industry, and re*lax the r|estrictions on the proportion o!f foreign capital shares in e&ducati&o&n, m>e>di>cin>e an)d other f-ield-s with relatively larg#e ga|ps in the domestic market.
Chin;a wo!uld p-rotect the lawful rights and interests of foreign-invested enterprises.
H~e said that Chin]a woul\d p!ay c=lose attention to the study an{d proposal of the policy and system of construction of free trade ports in s&tep&s a[nd phases in Hainan, an;d wo{ul{d accelerate the process of exploring an}d building free trade p~o~r~ts with Chinese characteristics; would add new areas o^f Sh]a]ng]hai Free Trade Area; set up a technology innovation board in Shanghai Stock Exchange, piloted the registration system to support the dev-e-lopm-ent of re"g"iona"l integra<tio<n in the Y^angt^ze River De~lta and rose to a national strategy.
"Chinese eco}nomy i.s a sea, but n/o/t a small pond.
There ar:e periods of calm a'nd period=s o&f violent storms," Xi Jinping said, "Violent storms can overturn the small p`ond, b\ut not the sea.
Go%ing through countless violent st=or=ms, the sea is still the-re!
Going through more than 5,000 ye$ars of difficulties an)d hardsh)ips, China is still ther|e!
Facing t!he fu>t>ure, China will al?w?ay?s be here! "
He pointed out th>at the economi:c glo}b}al}izat}ion suffere)d se;tba;cks, and multilateralism and free trade system were impacted . T$here are stil@l various instabilities and uncertainties, and risk challenges intensified; open cooperation was an important driving force for strengthening internati(onal economic a!nd trade cooperation . Al(l countries should adhere to o+penin+g an_d accommodation, expand mutually beneficial development space and st%reng%then mac(roec(o(n(omic coordination.
He emph%asize%d again that Ch.ina's o)pening door would n[ot be closed, but would o,nly open wider and wi`der, and the pace for promoting a h`i`gher level of openness would not stop.
Ch=ina would stimulate import potentials, conform to the trend o~f domestic consumption upgrading, tak`e more active and effective measure=s, promote the increase of hou^sehold inc~o~me an`d cultivate high-end consumption growth points.
China would respect international business pra(ctices and t.reat all types of enterprises reg;is;tere;d i*n China alike and equally.
China would prot-e-ct the lawful rights and interests of foreign-invested enterprises, r,e,so,lutely punish violations of the law]ful rights a?nd interests of foreign merchants according to th$e law, especially for vio`lati`ons o{f intellectual property rights, improve the qual^ity and efficiency of intellectual property review, and introduce a puni=tive compensation s<ystem to significantly increas$e the c)o)st for viol?a?t?ing the law.
Referring to the Chinese economic prosp_ect_s, Xi Jinping sai;d that f;ro;m the perspectives of economic growth, employment, price, balance of payments, corporate profits, fiscal re`ven`ue, labo%r p$roduct$i$vi$t$y a@nd othe@r major indicators, the economic operation in China was in a r]eas]on]able range, laying an impo~rtant foundat'ion for achie@v@ing the year-round goals and t=asks.
The e?co?nom?ic growth in China wa=s sti%ll at the forefront of the wo+rld compared with other major economies.
"The fundamentals of healthy a{n{d sta;b;le economic development in C%hi%n%a remain unchanged, the condition#s of production factors supporting high-quality development remain unchanged, and t%h%e overall mo^me^ntum for long-term stability a$nd improvement remains unchanged. `)`
X.i Jinping sai#d t)h)at everyone can be optimistic about Chinese economic development prospects.
X@i Jinping sai!d that the macro-control capacity of C}h}ina continuously strengthen@e@d, and it had many favorable conditions t>o maintain the lo(ng-term healthy and sta!b!l!e ec|onomic development . The economic develo~pment in China also encountered o}utst}anding contradictions and problems, a\nd measures were taken to actively solve the contradictions and problems . The results had been and were sh>ow>ing.
"It is believed that i#f only keep%i%ng th!e strategic composu@r@e, deepening reform and opening u'p in an all-round way, a-nd making great efforts to solve outstanding contradictions and problems, C|hina's economy will surely be able t@o s$peed up its transition to a high-/q/uality development track. "Xi Jinping sa+id.

G{en{er{al Secretary Xi Jinping delivered a ver'y important spee-ch a[t the private sector symposium, injecting a firm confidence into the broader sta]g]e of the private econ;omy.
General Secretary Xi Jinping emp`h`as`ized that "letting ent/rep/r/eneu/rs u\nlo\ad their m:en:tal loads an&d m"arch with light packs", whi[ch has a strong resonance among entrepreneurs and innovative entrepreneurs.
Market vit)a)lity comes from pe;opl;e, especially from entrepreneurs, from ent|rep|r|e|n|e|ursh|ip.
In the magnificent co+ur+se of the 40 years of reform and opening u|p, there are thousands of entrepreneurs entrepreneurship and i*n*novatio*n stories, the gro.wth an>d expansion of entrepreneurs-group consta{n{tly push the Chinese eco;nomy t#o sail far.
For some time, som"e people i[n the society have publis&he&d som]e rema)rks that negate and doubt the private economy.
The so#-called "private e!conomi!c departure theory" and "n"ew public-private partnership theory" and other misconceptions have caused some entrepren*eurs ’ dou,bts an?d concerns.
R.ecently, some private enterprise have encountered many difficult`ie`s and problems i:n their busin"e"ss development.
For example, the c$hang$es in the international economic environment ha+ve h,ad a+n impact on some export enterprises; th"e r{a{pid adjustm~ent of the demand structure has brought ab.o.u.t the press\u\re o^f transformation and upgrading; some policies are not coor_din_a_t_e_d with each othe;r, the polic@y effects are superimposed in the same dire%ction, or the working methods are si\mpl\e, resulting in some policies with good o*rigin*al intentions have the opposite effect, etc.
All kinds o@f factors are intertwined, the pr-ivate ec`onomy is fa$cin$g difficulties, some private en(ter(pr(is(es are facing difficulties, and entrepreneurs show a lot o@f anxiety.
Under this context, it is particularly profound and practical to correct the cognition er'rors, let the entr"epre"neur"s ’ unl;oa;d the mental load, let them deve_lo_p w\h\olehea\rtedly, make t,he gove{r{nment promote development devotedly a#n#d concern ma-rke-t confidence and development expectations.
Thi#s symposium once again emphasized the importa(n(t assertion of the `+` Three no-changes": `@` There is no c~ha~nge i|n the role and function of non-public sector in our economic a'nd soci%al development"!
In recent years, from deepening th]e promotion of streamline administration an^d delegate more power to lower-level governments, establishing a power list sy$ste$m, and creatin(g a leg|al environment that protects the leg:it:imat:e rights and interests of ent@repr@e@neurs, creating a market environment of f]air co/mp/etition and shaping the atmosphere o~f re's'pecti'ng entrepreneurs i,n the who"le society, the Party Central Committee has a!ttach!e!d unprecedented emphasis o)n entrepreneurs and institutional guarantees.
The symposium clearly sta!t!ed th"e si.x aspects ’ policy measures to vigor"o"us"l"y support the development a`nd ex[pansio[n of private enterpr?ises, and launched a series of pragmatic actions dedicated t-o the "m!ar!ch with light packs" of private enterprises.

Exports of Korean g>i>nseng chicken s+oup to C*hi*n*a surged 20 times in f%o%ur years, which may be r/e/late/d to th]e increase of empty-nest youth - China News
Exports o&f K`orea`n ginseng chicken soup t+o China surged 2_0 times in four years; an<aly<sis: it is related to the increase of e)mpt)y-)nes)t youth
According to the report on Day 5 o/f Yonhap, las{t year, the export sales of Korean ginseng chi;cken s*oup to China exceeded 100,000 US dollars, which surged 20 tim*es compared with t~hat o"f four ye=ars ag_o, in 2013.
Th@e analysis suggests that t"h"is growth is re$la$ted to the hot sales of c:onveni:enc:e foo~d driven by the increasing number of empty-nest youth in China, as well as the increas~ing attention o'f young people on nu-tr-it-ious meals.
This dat]a i#s published b<y t@he Korea Agro-Fisheries & Food Trade Corp (aT) on Day 5.
Last year, the export sales of K_orean ginseng chicke,n soup t}o Ch~ina was 100,339 US dollars an=d th-e weight was 21,859 kg, which surged by 2094% and 3668.8% resp}ec}t}i}vely compared with that i#n 2013.
The analysis suggests that the increasing sale.s of Korean g@inseng chicken soup in China ar=e related to the h"ot sales o[f convenience food driven by the i,ncr,easin,g number of empty-nest youth in Ch`ina, as well as t$he increasing attention of young people o~n nutritious me;al;s.
B[y the end of this year, the number of one-person households i"n C.h.ina have exc,eeded 200 mill:io:n, and it i}s expected to increase to 3!0% of the total population by 2~0~2~0 . Local food enterprises are al]so aiming at the “ eating-alone p,e,opl,e" and launching various convenience f~oo~d.
Moreover, the analysis also i\ndica\te\s th?at bird flu is th^e b"ig"g"est factor which prevents gi<n<seng chicken soup from taking root in the C'hi'n'e'se mainland market.
aT says that bird flu outbroke in South Korea from November 2016 t`o April of la;st year . Relevant departments comprehensively b-a-n the expo`r`t of ginseng chic:ken soup to China wh;ich le]ads to sharp reduction o<f export sales.
In 2!016, the export sales of ginseng chicken soup in China was 840,000 U|S d=ol=la=rs . Du{e to bi`rd flu, the export s,a,l,es o&f last year plummeted to 100,000 US dollars.

A gateway flag-raising ceremon&y is h{eld in Hekou po@rt o{n China-Vietnam boarder to celebrate the National Day.
`|` I didn't expect t*o see such a spectac~u~la~r flag-raising ceremony on the f)ront)ier . It is more am?az?ing to watch the flag-raising here than in the mainland. `'`

Hekou port is the biggest port o]n China-Vietnam boarder in Yunnan . I;t is lo~cate~d in He)k)ou count[y in Honghe Pre!fectur!e in Yunnan Province with just a r@iver away from Lao Cai City i'n Vietnam . It is a first-class national po$rt.
With t;h;e continuous enhancement of `#` One Belt and One Road" co,nstruct,i,on in China, a?s one of t>he most convenient passage con+n+ec+tin+g China and Southeast Asia, Heko|u port has a steady growth of de%part%ure and entry fl/ow.
At 7:30 in the early morning of the same d%ay, a ra[y o.f sunshin|e just s?howed in the sky . The l#ocal people and Chinese an-d foreign touris%ts had gathered in the restricted areas in Hekou port very early to watch t|he fla?g-r?aising ceremony.

After the flag-raising command made by the commander, th!e flag raiser wa#ved his arm hard to draw an arc . The bri?ght five-star r=ed f^lag stretched out like an "eagle stretch}ing its wi*n*gs", and rose slowly wit:h the melody o`f the ma@jestic and impassio]n]ed national anthem.
"It not only s>how>s C#hi#na '~s image, b(ut also insp|i|re|s th~e patriotism among people o\f all nationalities in border areas to held a flag-r>a>ising ceremony o?n every New Year's day, Spring Festival, National Day, and other time nodes of great significanc=e. "

From the be&ginnin&g of this year to the p@rese@nt, th=e DPRK and the ROK bro^ke the ice an*d opened the dialogue, and th!e DPRK - ROK and the DPRK-US lea%ders held meetings . The general trend of the eas#ing of the pen~insu~la has been continued, an:d t;he dialogue ’ s principle of solving the peninsula issue has a}lso been adhere]d to.
First o?f all, the fact that "the es{senc{e of the peninsula iss/u/e is a security issue" has not changed . The k"e"y to realizing p/e/ace on the penins:ul:a is to resolve the reasonable security concerns of a&ll parties i/n a pr:oper and b.a.lance manner, instead of putting pressure o*n t?he o\ther side and stressing own demands.
Secondly, in the dialogue t^o realize th,e denuclearization of the peni^nsula, t-he parties concerned are s@till divided on the steps and wa-y-s to re.alize the denuclearization of the penins&ula . Due to the long-term lack of political trust between the DPRK and the Un,ited States, the game thinking of "who i@s fi]rst and who i@s second" i=s still strong.
At the public meeting of the UN Security Council Korean Peninsula issue held a/t the Un\it\ed Nations Headquarters i#n New York, t*he d=ifferent voices of t-h-e parties around the issue of sanctions against the DPR-K once again highlighted the two points on the peninsula t;h;at have no:t c[hanged.
Pompeo, US Secreta\ry o,f State, insisted that sanctions a)g)a)ins)t North Korea will not be lifted until the Ko/rea/n Peninsula i]s fully denuclearized.
Lavrov, Russian Foreign Minister, s~tressed th$e principle of "responding to ac[tion by action '$' . He pointed out: "The wea+ke+ning trend of sanctions should b!e in synch?ron?iza?tion with t|h|e pace taken by North Korea on the road o!f g#r#adual denuclearization."
Undoubted!ly, all parties concerned should continue to implement the Nor|th Korea related re|soluti|ons o+f the UN S<ecur<it<y Council in a comprehensive, complete and accura>te ma|nner . H:owe:ver, pressuring is no)t an end . The implementation of sanctions and the pr-om-otion of a polit@ica@l settlement are all requirements of the UN Security Council resolutions . The two can n%ot be neglected, and cannot o}nly choose on(e
As Chinese State Counc+i+lor and Foreign Min:i:s:t:e:r Wang Y#i said, in view of the curre-n-t positive de`velopments in the DPRK-R~OK and D:PR:K-US relations, China believes that it is necessary for the UN Security Coun)cil t*o consider launching reversible clauses in a timely man;ner, thereby enc[ouraging North Korea and relevant parties to t{ake a big mo!ve toward denuclearization.
Review the past, every development in the denuclearization o*f th\e peninsula and in the peace p;ro;cess requires t|h|e parties t#o demonstrate sufficient political c#oura#ge.
A=t pres\e\nt, in the fa`ce o-f the international community ’ s increasingly high expectations for promoting a pol#itical solution to the peninsula issue, all parties concerned sh~ould demonstrate political courage, make poli't'ical decisions, imp&lement commi[t[me[nt[s, resolv}e p<roble<ms, and continue t*o take the opposite direction a=nd advance peninsula denuclearization process and establish a peace mechanism on the penin\sul\a to jointly create a permanent peace on the p!eninsula.
A message from Ji Co`unt`y Peopl*e's Gover_nment i[n Linfen Cit!y in S\ha\nx\i Province on October 1 indicated that the scenic areas of Hukou Falls of Yellow River lo)cated in this cou'nt'y wou\ld maintain higher levels of water during the National Day holiday, s*o it didn't meet the requirements to b]e open to th]e public.
In order to ensure the safety, the scenic areas will be temporarily closed during th/e Na[ti[o[nal D&ay ho#li#day.
Hukou Falls o@f Yellow River is t>he second bi+ggest fa!ll i$n China, and the biggest yellow fall in the world.
The Yellow River flows here at great sp@eed, an_d the sto=n=e w\alls o,n both s*i*des are rising steeply . The river mouth b_ec_ome_s narrow lik:e th`e spout of kettle, forming the situation that "a thousand miles of Yellow River seems like t/o be collected in<to a kettle".
The reporter learned t'hat the flood season of yellow river would come in every June to October . Due to high levels of wat~er, the scenic area[s o;f Hukou Falls of Yell~ow River in Shanxi Province had been clos<ed on!e aft,er a>nothe>r si\nce July 1_2, 2018 . Ther>ef>or>e, according t.o the accumulative calculation, Huko`u scenic areas had been closed for nearly a month.
Ni Yufeng, t-he chief e]n]gin]eer of Hukou Scen!ic A{r{ea{s Management Committee, said t=o the media that it w'as the lo/n/gest time for the Yell{ow River to k%eep high leve\ls of water during the past 2&0 years . "It hasn't been closed for such a long time . W[e closed it for four days in the flood season in 20)17 . However, it has been c|lo|se|d for n(early a month. "
It was learned that the s;cenic areas o(f Hukou Fa|l|l|s of Yellow River in Shanxi Province had originally arranged extra staff and vehicle maintenance in advance i|n or}der t;o be well-prepared for the "National Day"' go"ld"en week, a<nd e!v!en the temporary staff had been hired.
Ac}co}r}ding t|o the "Notice on Bei@ng Well-prepared for the Floo*d Control in the Yellow River during th@e N[a[tional D@ay Holiday ',' issued in the "Office Telegram of Yellow River Flood Contro;l and Drought Relief Headquarters", Qinghai, Gansu, Ningxia, Inner Mongolia, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Henan, Shandong were re$qui$red to be well-prepared for th{e flo=od control in the Yellow R>iv>er during t,he National Da`y holiday.
Currently, the flo]w of the main stream of the Yellow R#i#ver is rel)at)iv)ely large . The upstream riv@er flow i=s maintained at 20-0-0-3000 cubic meters p!er second, the midstream riv;er flow i^s maintained at 2500―3500 cubic meters per second, and the downstream rive:r flow i@s maintained at 3000 c~ub~ic meters per second.

Report of Reuters on O/c/tober 1 in Toky]o: A q(uarte(rl(y Tankan survey repor]t released by the Bank of Japan o)n Monday showed tha>t the confidence of Japanese major manufacturers hit its lowest l;evel i;n more than a y,ear for that season in September, a_s raw material costs ro;s;e and a series of natu)ral disasters a!ffe!c!t!ed production, putting pressure on enterprises.
This su{r{vey almost didn ’ t sh.ow that the escalating global trade frictions shook t<h<e conf%idence of large manufacturers.
However, risks o{f outbreak of an all-out tra`de war stuck the business pr-os-pe-cts of enterprises, likely to th!re!aten the business capital ex,p,e,nditure.
The active capital expenditure i>s a hi`g`hlight of Japanese eco@n@omy.
This survey r/aised questions about the view of the Bank of J^ap^an on that robust econom|ic expansion wo`uld help t!o accelerate inflation t+o the 2% target, although there we(re signs tha]t enterprises were gradually shifti+ng costs to the customers.
`%` With concerns raised by the global trade war, as exports slow"ed down a'nd factory production w\ea\kened, t%he confidence of manufacturers tended to s=tagnate," said Takeshi Minami, th@e Principal Researcher of Norinchukin Research I\ns\titute Co., L]td ..
"Conf!ident is stil@l at a high level . An'd sinc_e corporate profits are improving and prices are risi*ng, I d!on't think confidence will continue to decline. "
The Tankan survey showed that the judg;m;en;t index for t(he boom of large-scale manufa"c"turing declin$ed from positive 21 for three month's ago to positive 19 i<n September, wo_rsening for the third consecutive quarter.
The median ma@rket forecast is po-sitive 22.
The j%udgm%ent index for the boom of large-scale ma?nufa?ctur?i?ng declined from positive 24 researched in Jun-e to positive 2@2 in Sep?tember, worsening for the first tim>e for eight qua!r!ters.
The sur&vey o-f Reuters was positive 22.
Th&e survey showed t*ha*t the judgment index fo[r the boom of la[rg[e-s[cal[e manufacturing and non-manufacturing was expected to remain s'table in December.
Investors were indifferent to the decline of the judgment index fo%r the boom of Tankan enterprises . The N`ikk`ei .N225 rose to a 27-ye`ar high spot on Monday as the continued depreciation of the y-en helped improve the export p&rof&it p^ro^spects o}f J'apanes'e enter~pr~ises.
T=he capital expendi[t[ure was robust.
Although the confidence of ent^e^r^pr^i^ses declined, the latest Tankan highlighted th`e rob(u(st(ness o~f enterprise capital expenditure plans, benefiting from the renewed capacity a,n,d i)ncr)eas)ed investment in robots and automation t}o cope wi?th th=e labor shortage caused by the aging of population.
T,he Tankan surv~ey of the Bank of J;a;pa;n showed that the capital expenditure of large-s;cale ent=er=pri=se plans would i*ncre*ase by 13.4% for the fiscal year end'ed in March 2019.
It was 13&.6% f@or previous Tankan survey.
Takes"hi Minami said that the capital expenditure of all enterprise plans for th&is fiscal y?ear increased b#y 8.5%, close t`o th`e pa*ce of Japan ’ s bubble era.
He said, "considering that small businesses raise their profit estimates from now on, there is still room fo^r fu?rther gr&o&wth in capital ex'p'endit'ure, but that larg+ely d_e_pends on the i@mpact o/f the tr&ade war on business confidence. "
T[he T\ank\a\n surv$ey showed th+at th(e ability o&f enterpr&is&es to pass o^n costs was enhanced . The output price index of large enterprises was positive 7, which was a 10-year high spot . It wa#s an enco]uragin]g sign, reflecting that Japan had made progress in its efforts to c/ombat deflation.
The index m*ea*surin*g t|he employment situation of l|arge enterprises hit n\egative 23, which was the most tight level since 19<92, highlighting th/e tightening of the employment market.
Benefiting from the robus*t enter*prise e%xp%end%i%t%ure, Japanese economy rebounded from January-March s]h]ri]nk in the second quarter.
However, the escalation of trade frictions i^n su]mmer and the disturbance of natural disasters on supply chains had ca#s#te#d a shadow ove_r t]he pr:os:pects of Japanese economy which depended on expo+rts.
In dollar terms, impo{rt and export o"f services increase b;y 16.4%.
The news re`leas`e of the website o@f the Ministry o>f Commerce citing the head of t*h*e De'partment of Trade i@n Se<rv<ices and C)ommerc)ia)l Ser|vi|ces said that the total import and export volume of emerging serv@ices exc'eed'ed 1 trillion yuan f.ro.m January to August, and the growth rate was faster than that of the whole.

In terms o_f service export, the service export continued it,s rapid gr%ow%th momentum since this year, and t^he export growth rate was 5.?7 percentage points higher than t:he import growth rate fro>m January to A*ugust.
Among them, t"he t.op three areas of growth ar:e tel,ecommu,nica,tions, co^mpu^t^er and information services, personal culture and entertainment services a%nd insurance se,rvices, w-it-h growth rates o`f 61.1%, 38.8% and 26.5%, respectively.
Th|e head of the Department of Trade in Services and Commercial Services a-lso pointed out that the proportion o)f import o#f emerging servi.ces also gradually increase,d from January t@o August.
The import of emerging services increased rapi/dl/y, accounting for 23..6% of service import, w<ith a?n increase of 1.6 percentage points o=ver the same p>eriod last year f_ro_m January to August.
Among the@m, the import growth rates of financial ser/vices, intellectual prop`e`rty rights usage fees, and telecommunications, computer a\nd information services a-ll exceeded 20%, wi`th 47.1%, 23.3% a\nd 23.2% resp,ectiv,ely.

O\il prices may usher in the `+` three consecutive rises", drive&rs can fi_l_l up the tank for National Day self-driving travel i@n a-dvan-ce.
China News Service, Be#ijin#g, September 30 (reporte_r Qi[u Yu) - At 24 o ’ clock on September 3*0, the n>ew round of refined oi~l price adjustment window will be opened si=mul=t=ane=ously with the National Da$y hol-iday.
A number o_f institutions predict that oil prices will rise sharply, achieving a "three conse)c)u)tive ris^es '^'.
Car owners who pl!an self-driving can fil$l the c<ar with oil before the price inc$rea$ses.
According to th}e da>ta calculated by OilChem, t'he corresponding in=cr=ease magnitude in domes$tic refined oi(l is expected to be around 190 yuan/ton; t|h|e increase predicted by Zhuochuang Information is 220 yuan/ton.
In September, oil prices have been raised twice: on September 3, gasoline was raised by 180 yuan / ton, d>iesel was r+aised b/y 170 yuan / t[on; o$n Se~pt~embe~r 17, gasoline w;as raised by 145 yu=an / t'on, diesel w%as raised b!y 145 yuan / ton.
D&omest&ic oi(l prices link u*p with international oil p(ric(es . Since the current round of pricing, in}ternati}o}n}al oil price_s have increased with fluctuation and Brent crude oil has broken through the $8`0 mark and continu}es to increase.
As of the c>los>ing on September 28, the U+S WTI crude oil futures closed u}p wi"th $1.1>3 US, reported $73.25 / barre*l.
Brent crude oi#l futures c@los@ed up wit?h $1.0, r?eport?ed $82.72 / barrel.
"From the international situation, the U=S sanctions against Iran and other t]ens]ions are superimposed, and the overa^ll trend of oil prices i`s strong . Subsequently, the OPEC Production C]ut Confere$nc$e explicitly refus+ed to i%ncrease production, giving m^ar^ket confidence to believe that the oil prices w)il)l move up stea<d<ily. "
Zhuochuang Information refined oil product analyst Z|ang Wen?gang said.
In terms of retail sale>s, the prices of gasoline at N?o . 92 and No . 95 of Beijing CNPC a:nd S~in~o~pec gas stations are 7@.66 yuan/liter and 8.15 y<uan/li<t<er r(espectivel(y.

Yves L[e Gall, the chairman of International Astronautical Federation addressed at the opening cere'mony that the global aerospace industry wa's no longer involving on!l!y a f~ew countries and agencies . The number of participants this year was significantly increasing from last session, which suggest\ed th%at m}ore and mor]e institutions and i[ndividu[als were taking part i{n i/t.
H:e called on cou^ntri^es to strengthen cooperation and innovation, and promote th@e development of aerospace industr!y.

Report o"f Reuters on November 5 in Beijing: Acco(rding to a press release released on Sunday by th-e China Fo>rei>gn Trade C_e_n_ter, the Canton Fair s{howed that the situation o*f China's foreign trade wa#s still compl"ex and serious, with expectation of 80.6% of enterprises exports i)n 2018 to be better than o&r mai!n!ta!i!n at t}h}e same le/v/el as last year.
Ho=w=ever, in consideration of t*he rising costs of domestic r$aw materials, la+bor force and other comprehensive factors, as well a>s the external environment of the increasing i/mpa/ct of Sino-US trade frictions, exhibi"tors a_l_s_o believed that t]h]e export situation of next year was not opt$imist$ic.
A't the closing pre/s/s conference of th}e 124th Canton Fair, Xu B)i)ng, the deputy secretary-general and spokesman of the Canton Fair, and the vi$ce-$direct$o$r of the China Forei>gn T)rade Center, said that the number of overseas buyers and export transactions o;f this Canton Fair h.ad declined slight@ly c=ompared with the same peri?o?d of last year.
The number of b;uyer;s who attended this C-anto-n Fair was 189,812 and they came from 215 countries and r^egi^ons, w#ith a decre-ase of 1.11% on y"ea"r-"on-"year basis.
The amount of export transactio]ns was 20.6..494 billion yuan ($29.86 billion), with a decrease of 1% o,n ye%ar-%on%-yea%r bas_i_s.
From th<e perspective o*f the mar.k.e.t, t%he transactions with Ja#pa#n, th"e ten ASEAN countries, `{` the BRI?CS c\ountr\ies" and Korea increased by 74.4%, 1[1[.4%, 7.2% a/nd 2.5% r#e#spect#iv#ely, while the transactions with traditional markets of the United States, Australia, Canada and t'he European Union decreased b'y 30.3%, 8.9%, 7.3% a'nd 0.8% respectively.
Fr|om the perspective o-f the industry, the transactions of transportation tools, machinery and e:qu:ipm:ent, building and de:c:or:ativ:e materials, electronic consumer goods, inf~ormation products, an.d sanitary equipment i&nc&reased by 24.8%, 21<.1%, 20.0% and 1<5.1% respectively, while the transactions with textile cl@oth@i@n@g and household appliance+s decreased b)y 13.0% and 6!.7% respectively.
Xu Bing said that as a barometer a?nd weathe,rvane of China's foreign trade, the b^uy^ers ’ particip%a%tion situation and the export transaction data of this Ca,nt,on Fair s|howed th]a]t Chi;na's foreign trade development would still face ma^ny uncertain a_nd unstable factors next year.
However, with the deepening o<f supply-s'ide structural refo[rm and the "six stability" policies an`d measures recently introduced by the state and lo(ca(l governments in succession, the new drivers for t.h.e development of C&h&ina ’ s foreign trade was accelerating th}e ac!cumulatio!n, and the diver(sific(at(io(n of enterprises and markets had made ne<w progress, all of which were the impor&tan&t foundation and stro-ng conditions for the development o~f foreign t/r/a/de.
"Taking all factors into consideration, i/t is ex|pected that the imports a)nd exports of China's foreign trade will m.aintain a st)eady gr<o<w<th th-roughout the year, with f|urth|er improvement in quality a*nd efficiency. "Xu Bing said.
The Chin~a ’ s General Administrat+i+on of Customs published that p.ric.ed in dollars, the exports in September increased by 14".5% on year-on-year basis, th]e i"mport"s increased by 14[.3% on year-on-year basis, the trade surplus in September was $31.69 bill@ion, and the export growth r$a$t$e a"nd trade su!r!p!lus i`n September were the h)ig)h)est since February.
In despite of th<e escalating trad#e frictions between China and the United States, China's export performance in September still significantly exceeded expectation . Strong external demand, and the enterprises rushing to export befo~r~e imposing tariff$s in the United States a]nd the depreciation of RMB exch_ange rate, mig?h?t be th\e main s%upportin%g fac\tors, and also sh+owed the resilience of China's foreign trade t$o a certain ex{tent . However, the impact of the Sino-US tra(de w*ar o<n confidence a{n{d the industrial chain c.a.n not b^e neglected . Analysts believed that t\he challen%ges for China's foreign trade might emerge i<n the four*th quarter or next year.
Reuter-s s%urveys showed tha&t the U.|S. fund managers proposed to increase ca*s*h ho~ldi~ngs and stood the cautious ground in September, since the United States and China began the latest round o$f mutual import tariffs and there w`as no sign of dispute eas-ing.
However, according to the suggestion of 1|2 fun'd managers who participated i}n this surv(e(y, the asset all;ocation in North America rose t^o the highest level since Jun+e 2017, while positions in Brita/in, the Eurozone and partic|u|larl|y emerging markets declined.
The average of global st\ock al,location accounted for 56.6% an,d the bonds accounted fo>r 3|5.5%, which was basically consis+te+nt with the survey of last month.
The most ob&vious change was that the cash r.atio rose to 5.1%, which was the highest propor;t;ion since Dece]mber 2(014.
A fund ma#na#g#e#r of a large f<u<nd company said, "So)m)e econom.ic d'ata have b\ro\ught confidence to th#e m{ar{ket, but the trade war is still the biggest concern, so that it's bett{er to get prepared to enter when the market falls a~fte~r a rise. "
H;o;w;ev;er, the fund managers s't'il'l preferred stocks in Sept<emb<er, especially American st)o)cks, ev=e=n though the price o]f American stocks were considered to be on the high s(i(de.
Today, in Shanghai, th%e opening-up landmark of Chin*a, China International Import Expo (CIIE), t_h_e world's fir`st large-scale state-l|evel exhibition with the theme o>f i.mpor.t, has officially opened in much antici)patio)n.
An exhibition is li]ke a "window" w.hich can let t]h]e world kno>w a c$i$ty and a country better.
Through the `;` window" o[f CIIE, people can see t}h}e "opening-up China '@' w&hich moves towards a hig(her le+vel; with the help of the "window" of CI\IE, we welcome the world and China which is "restarting from reform and opening-up", t}o ach<ieve mut=ual benefits an@d win-win results.
"For a country, ope@ning-up is like coming out o|f th{e cocoon and be+comi+ng a bu<tt<e<rf<ly . Ther'e will be pain, but there will be new life. "
General Secretary Xi Jinping's summary of Open Road reve{als a`n important r/eason "wh*y China can d\o it".
Looking ba#c#k on the past 40 years of reform a(nd opening-up, China dare<s to plu^nge into the vast se[a of the world market . Al>thou>gh it has encountered whirlpool and storm, i=t always faces al)l risks and chall`eng`es with an open atti-t-ude, constantly releases its endogenous driving force a{nd continuo$u$sly improves its competitiveness.
So to speak, China h)as fully d|emonstrat|ed t'he value and significance of opening-up with its solid achi^evement^s.
Standing a;t a new historical star?ting point, i/t is a m,ajor decision to h|old an expo with the t|heme of import made by the P$a$rty Central Committ:e:e with the core of Comrade Xi Jinpin+g with a view to promoting a new round of high-level opening to the outside w(orl(d . I|t is a major measure for China to actively op]en the market to the world a=n=d i@s also a practical ac=ti=o=n taken by Chin[a to support t%h%e economic globalization and trade li[ber[alization, showin-g a stron|g and clear will that "Chi&na's opening door won't close, but wou[ld open wider and wider".
Exhibitors from all over the world are eager to enroll in t'h'e exhibition, an-d "it is difficult t$o app+ly f%or a stand", which is the greatest affi#rma#ti#on an{d best re-sponse to China's development of a^n open econo%m%y in a larger scope, a wider range of fields a`nd a+t a deeper level.
Mo+re importantly, the current global ec}onomi}c a|nd trade order has reached a crossroad.
So#m#e countri<es have built trade protectionist walls and retreated into the unilateralism, which increa%ses anxiety of the international society about t_h_e prospects f>or fr+e+e trade and adds much uncertainty t_o a recovering world ec/onomy.
Under such era background, thi's grand gathering along the Huangpu River demonstrates China '"s guard t#o fre]e trade and shows the world China '&s c%o%nfidenc%e and responsibility t'o open its markets and shar^e its future.
It is fast t?o g]o alone but it i\s further to go in crowds.
By embracing the world with an open mind, China has not only v,igoro,usly promo>t>ed its own development, b|u|t als_o brou$ght about trem]endous "China opportunities" to other countries and reg%ions.
In recen-t years, by a.dvocating an"d promoting the joint development of the "One Belt and One Road '?', initiati\n\g and setting up the As=ian Infrastructure In#vestmen#t Bank (AIIB), and establishing the S;i;lk Road fund...China has provided a series o:f international public goods, a solid export market, d&e&velop&ment opportunities and j`ob`s, allowing companies of various coun`tr`ies t+o ge@t a ride on th@e "e.x.press train '=' and take "hitchhiking" of China '}s development.
CIIE is a@lso this kind of public g`oods a.nd a big p$latform for global economic and trade cooperation.
O.n this pl{a{tfo{rm, more than 3,000 enterprises from more than 130 countries and regions have m`ade thei$r debut with hi.gh-qualit.y products an<d services with d.isti.nctiv.e features, taking a new st~ep into the Chinese market.
Apart fro_m companies of various countries, th\e real beneficiaries are domestic c{onsumers.
By building the platform of "selecting the best and importing the best", w~e c~an provide m:ult:iple channels of high-quality s,upply f`or consumption upgrading a(nd meet people's perso)n)al)ized, diversified a`nd differentiated consumption needs.
A=s China's openi/ng-up door o'pens wider and wi*de*r, t(he goods flow is sm,ooth and materials are put to good use, thus the pace tow"ards a better life will be more solid.
From a broader perspective, t<he significance of CIIE has gone beyond the sc:ope of economy an!d trade . It has the f#uture in mind, co~nve~y~s the concepts of o|penne|ss, inc,lu,siven,e,s,s, universal benefit, b`a`lan`c`e and win-win, and f*o*rm*s a co$n$s$ens$us to jo@i@n@tly meet today's challenges.
Onl}y when the world is do(ing well can China do we)ll; when C(hina i)s good, the world is better.
We expect CIIE to make the world wonderful an-d complete; we ar}e looking forward t^o t\he bright future that a-n "o>p>ening-up China" moving to a higher level and the w<orld build a community of hu%man destiny.
Foreign media repor`t that the United States and Can:ada have rea|ched a framework agreeme[nt on the No(rth American Free Trade Agreement.
[Abstr|a|ct] The cont#ent o\f the Agree%ment includes Canada opening its da*iry market to the United S{tates and a temporary suspension of U.S#. tariffs on the cars produced in Canada.
It is reported b#y foreign media that a Canadian source said in the eve'ning o'f September 30 at l?o?c?al time that the United States a$n$d Cana:da have reached a framework agreement on t~he North American Fr,e,e Trade Agreement.
I~t i"s revealed that t|he content of the Agreement includes Canada opening its dairy market to t]he United Stat{es and a temporary suspension o}f U.S. tariffs on th>e cars produced in Canada.
O-n Day 2>7 of last month, t&h&e United States and M|exico announced a preliminary principled ag;reemen;t on updating the N%o%rth American Free Tra-de Agreement while the United States and Canada failed to re^ach an agreement before the deadline s!et by the Ameri:can side of Au-g-u-st 31 and extended the negoti(ation deadline to September 30.
Pre$v$iously, a spokesman for Canadian Foreign Minis#ter Freeland said that Canada would on\l\y sign a favorable agreement, and `(` the focus is on substance rather than timetables . We wil+l con?ti?n?ue to consult in the ho?pe o~f reaching an agreement that i`s in l|ine with the na]tional interests of Canada. "
Over 90% of Brazilian female voters sai+d that the presidential ca@ndida@te did n%ot consid/e/r women ’ s needs.
According to the Overseas Chinese News Network o(f South America, d"a"ta released by Brazilian Institute of G<eography an;d Statistics (I/BG/E) recently s,howed that mo-re than 90% o{f Brazilian wo}m}en do not think that the presidential candidate considers the needs of wo$men.
According t#o the report, the number of women in Brazil h,as reached 107 million . If women f-rom all o"ver Brazil are brought together t>o form a co,untr,y, the c)ount)ry ’ s population will r/ank 13th in the worl@d, more than twice th+e population of Spain.
I-n Braz:i:l, the number of the wome%n voters accounts for 52% of the total number of v,o,t,ers, and me.n acc>o>un>t for 4&8% . Although t\he proportio~n of women among voters is very high, the proportion of w"om"en in t>he National Congress of Brazil is only 10%.
Among the 193 co]u]ntries i}n the world, Brazi|lian women ’ s par_ticipa_tion in politics ranks onl$y 154th, higher than that of Arab countr+ies.
After mo_re th@an 20 years of power struggle, Bra+z+ilian women still h~ave not succeeded in obtaining the!ir reserved rights.
Accord$ing t+o Brazilian sociologist Natalia M/ori, th&e existence of this phenomenon is because of the combined effects of ancient patriarchal society, r~acialism, and capitalism v}al}ues.
"P)ol)itics should be civil rights, identity, access to public goods, and the formation of the sam@e society b`y multiple social gr%o%ups advocated by citizens . But t)he politics of Brazi@l belong to a mono"p"o"ly of a certain group, and most o?f the popu`lation is no`t rep}r}esen}ted. "
A p*re*v*ious study by th{e Locomotiva also pointed out that 94% of Brazilian w<o<men do not fee@l that the politicians elected by the election ca&n represent their rights, and 9{0% of Brazilian women disagree w)ith the decisions made by politicians . 93% o_f w\omen disagree with the curr!ent government po]l]icy.
"We need to re"vers"e the problem of underrepresentatio)n of women i%n National Congress, an*d Brazil ’ s political system is still af~f~ected by in.equal.ity . So far, t`here has been serious gender, clas+s and racial discrimination in t(he political field in Brazil. `\` N$ata$lia Mori said.
Although there i/s th_e lack o^f women ’ s rights, mo?st Brazilian women still be#l#i#eve in the power of democracy.
The survey shows that 76% of w]ome]n believe t&hey can make a di|ffe|rence in democratic elections, a,nd 7+2% of women are i{ntere{st{ed in politics.
In additi}o}n, 55% of w,om,en believe that democratic politics is the be,st w_ay to expose women to le.s.s prejudice.

The T@2 terminal of Guilin Liangjiang I#ntern#at#iona#l Airport in G'uangx'i was officially opened on the 30|th.
Zhao Leqin, Guilin Municip,al Party Committee Secretary, said that after the opening of t^h^e new terminal, it can meet the de`mand for passenger throughput of 12 million passengers pe'r ye^ar, and it build a new a?d?van?tage o'f Gu$il$in ai_r traffic . The new terminal has great signi@ficance for further i|mpr|oving the "four in one '>' three-dimensional traffic pattern of Guangxi r%i%ver sea linkage, sea-railway com%b%i%n%ed trans}portation, advance both by land a)nd water, and airport l_ink up.
This year, Guilin is e]x]pected to receive exceed 9{0 million v+isi+tors.
The expansion project of the T;2 terminal and the st?a?tio?n supporting fac}ilities of Guilin Liangjiang International Airport is a major public welfare p&roje&ct of the 60t@h ann;iversa;ry of the founding o$f Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Reg_io_n . It is also a landmark project for t:he construction of Guilin International Res(or(t.
The project started in December 2015 with a construction ar&ea of 100,000 square meters and a total investment o#f 3.258 billion yua&n . After the completion o<f the project, it can me=e=t the dem^and of annual passenger throughput of 1>2 mil%l%ion passeng&ers, take-off and landi]ng of 101.2 thousand sorties, a#nd cargo ships handling capacity o{f 9+5,000 tons.
O.n th/e s[a[me day, more than two hundred flights took off and landed a{t the T2 te#r#minal of Guilin Liangjiang International Airport.
T}he design of the new terminal is inspired b(y the concept o{f Guilin ’ s scenery i#s the best in the world . It is like a `-` lands'cape crown ')' from a distance and Longj,i Rice Terraces wonderful scenery and the roofs o~f the stack-up Guibei folk houses fro!m a close view, which is i,n harmony with the landsc*ape of Gu?ilin.
According to repo"r"ts, t@he n#ew terminal of Guilin Air?p?ort can meet the peak flow of nearly 4,000 passengers per h~ou~r entering a]n]d leaving port . It use+s intelligent baggage s<orti<ng system, secu,ri,ty integration platform, face r_ec_ogni_tio_n and other "smart airport" technology to pl}an coverage of cate_ring, department store, tax-free an;d leisure entertainment, and other business areas.

ECNS, Qingdao, October 1 -:- Affected by Typhoon Tr=ami, the first ra>ce day of 2018 Qingdao "Mazarin" C"up powered b@y Extreme Sailing Series w"as po~stponed from September 30 to October 1, and the pre-game meetin|g was h%el%d before the race in Olympic Sailing Center in Qingdao . The captains o&f 12 hydrofoil catamaran teams fr]om 6 countries a)nd r~egions at(t(ended at the meeting.
Affect}ed by Typho&on T~rami, t!h!e strong winds constantly bl'e'w in the harbor basin and t%he maximum wind s^peed even reached 24 knots . The sailing signa,l was delayed by nearly 90 minutes from 1:00 pm on September 30 . The wind speed was st_ill not reduced, so t_h_e Race Di;r;ector An:ne Mallédant announced to cancel th_e race of the first day and postpone the ra]ce to th@e afternoon on October 1.
"T=he stron:g wi]nds from the shore never seem to stop, an;d the state o"f the sea is so severe. "
Mallédant ex:plained: "N^o o/ne knows the time when the gust wil'l blo&w to the racing boats as well as the scale of wind forc_e.
Since the boat-sailing fiel`d is near the city, so fa|r as it goes, the wisest ch&o&ice is to can'cel the race. `<`
T)he sailors still felt a li#ttle disappointed f>or everything was ready.
"The racing boats are ready, an"d we are in excellent c`on`dition. `$`
T,he helmsman of Q-in-gda-o Team Max Richardson sai#d fr.ankl.y: "But I know it is a right choice t>o ch,a,n,g,e the race d}ate . And I hope the wind w~ill die down today, so that w,e can do some good. "
Micah Wilkinson, the "Hope S/t/ar '&' o&f New Zealand Team f\or 2020 Tok(yo Olympiad, said: "Losing a d@a@y's time makes the r^ace more interesting.
Because the race content w>ill b^e increased today, an=d there will be onl'y two d[a[ys left for the race.
All o<f us will play hard>. "
Though th*e s,e,a wind ble,w violently, the helmsman of F\ren\ch ABM Team Pi?erre-Yves Durand told his warm memories with Qingd*ao at t@he pre-game meeting that he was accidentally injured in the Extreme Sailing Se`ries 5 years a'go, resulting i@n the muscular rupture, and fortunately, the local race medical team helped him d`eal w=ith it so t'hat he could stand here to ta%ke part in the race after 5 y$ears.
It was learned that th?e Extreme Sailing Series started from 2(00(7, and it was a|n ISAF game equivalent to the Vol^v^o Ocean Race, t+he Ameri~ca's Cup a'nd th%e World Match Racing Tour.
The h:ydr:ofoil catamaran of "Fl{yingPhan{t{om" would be u;se;d in this r'ace in Qingdao.
It is th-e 8th year of havi~ng this race in Qingdao, the "City of S"ails '}' . And it is t]he last race of thi:s Series.
Although the turbulence i)n global fin+an+cial markets continued, the Hong Ko"ng Monetary Au,thority sai&d on Monday that the investment inc%ome of the Exchange Fu%nd in th;e third quarter of this year fell b+y 97% annually, and it was better t=h=an that in the p\r\evi\ous q]ua]rter, since overseas stocks rose and f)o)r)eign exchange losses obviously narrowed under the China-U.S. trade war.
According to the latest data of th)e Hong Kong Monetary A#uthority, t+he Exchange Fund recorded investment income of H}K $1.6 billion from Ju!l!y to September 2018, significantly l#owe#r than HK $61.8 bill*ion i:n the same period last year, but better than the re:vised H_K $100 million i[n the second quarter of thi(s year.
Chen Delin, the president o#f the Hon^g Kong Monetary Authority, said on th*e legislative session that at t]he b@eg@inning of the China-U.S. trad:e war, the share index i>n Hong Kong and emerging markets ra%n counter t#o t>he U.S. shar_e index . By the e=nd of September and early October, after the U.S. share index peaked in succession, the market se(ntimen(t be~gan to reverse, since investors gradually realized that t~he trade war was als`o detrimental to th.e U.S. itself.
"It is good t"o have changes in the market sentime.nt . If the trade war o(nly has unilateral ef"fects, it does n')t help much for solving proble<ms. "
H[e also po|inted ou_t that "if the trade war cannot be solved, the flu}ctuation of financial markets will continue to rise. `?`
In the third quar|ter of th]is year, t)he st`ock investment loss;es o#f th~e Exchange Fund i!n Hong Kong narrowed by 8% to HK $4.7 billion compared with the previous quarter, and the i+n+ve+s+t+ment income of overseas stock increased by 17.2% to HK $12.8 billion; t/he fore$ign exchange losses was HK $16.2 billion an[d the bond yields w#as H'K $9.7 billion, with a decrease of 24% a/n/d 31% respectively, mainly r}ef}lecting the general rise of t]h]e US d-o-llar f*or exchange of major currenci:es in this quarte\r and th+e ris?e of the US coupon rate to above 3% in mid-September.
The Exchange Fund w^as mainly use_d for suppor@ti@ng Hong Kong dollars.
Hong Kong has implemented the li)nked exchange rate sys.tem f=o=r the Hong Kong dollar's peg to t|h|e US dollar si~nce 1983.
As for th!e current financial si(tuati(o(n in Hong Kong, Ch|en Delin said that t(h(e uncertainty of th]e economic and asset ma^r^kets increased and downside risks i}ncr}eased, but the financial s$y$stem Hong Kong was robust, so that good defence w}er}e made and the earthquake-resistant capacity w#as abundant.
`"` The international investment position is abund/ant i]n Hong Ko_ng, w=ith a net exte{rnal asset value of US $1$.4 trillion, which is 4 times GDP, higher than 2.5 ti;mes in Singapore and 0.6 times i#n Japa#n . It i-s enough to cope with the financial downturns or reversal. "
T<he current daily int;erest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars con/ti/nued to f$all and the i}nterest margin with U\S dollars expanded . Chen Delin pointed out that t<he exchange rate o(f the Hong Kong dollar rose more than 400 basi&s points on September 21 . The markets generally beli"eved that it was mainly related to the rise of the daily interest rates on p+riva+te loa&n&s of Hong K`ong dollars . And then the Hong Kong d>ol>l>ar hovered around 7.80-7.84 fo"r exchange of the US dollar . Until recent%ly, the daily interest rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars c`ontinued t/o fal|l, and the interest margin with US do;llars expanded, which m]i]ght attract more hedging activities to s"ell t~he Hong Ko<ng dollar a^nd buy th]e US dollar, triggering t|he oppo]rtuni]ty of the exchan]ge guarantee of the weak side again t"o increase compared with that of th*e previous period.
Ho?wever, h/e believed t+hat as the interest-rate rise cycle of the Hong Kong Ba,nk began a.nd the Hong Kong dollar interest rates were normalizing, t+he situation th{at Hong Kong doll+ar interest rates were low|er than US dolla&r interest rates would change in the future.
"The tr[en[d of Hong Kong do\llar interest rates and U?S dollar in{teres{t rates will be more consistent . Everyone m{us{t be more careful t@o manage risks and prepared to cope with mark\et fluctuations. "
Since th}e funds o"f the Hong Kon(g dollar w_a_s abundant, th|e daily in/t/er/est rates on private loans of Hong Kong dollars fel!l fu#r#ther . T,he three-month daily interest rates on private loan fe#ll by 0.9% t`o 2".08179% on Monday, and the interest rate differential with the US d-ollar increased from 46 ba\sis points to 51 b(a(sis points; t"he one-month daily interest rates on private loan hit the bottom within five months, and the in)te)r)est rat.e differential with the US dolla|r increased from 120 basis point(s to 127 basis points.
Fro_m May to mid-September, the spot r{ate of Hong K&on&g dollars was cl%ose t}o 7.85 with exchange of $1 most o[f the time.
D'urin'g th~at t%ime, due to factors o]f partial share offer gained outflows f`rom Hong Kong dollars after the completion of interest arbitrage activities an'd large-scale share offer activities, causing th,at the exchange guarantee for the wea)k side was triggered for the fir*st ti@me in April, and for many time?s in May an_d August.
The Ho!ng Kong Monetary Authority bou]ght Hong Ko{n{g dollars and sold Hong Kong do^llar^s at the level o^f 7.85 a%ccord%ing to the linked exchange rate system, in order t!o maintain the stability o?f the exchange rate of Hong K-ong dollars.
Th}e Hong Kong Monetary Authority bo|ught ar,o,und HK $52.1 billion under the mechanism of exchange guara]nt]e]e of the weak s%i%d%e from May to A/ug/ust.
Does foreigners can benefit from the n"e"w Ind=ivi=dua=l Income Ta[x Law?
O#n 30th, the relevant person in charge from Mi/nistry of Fina_nce a>nd St)a)te Administration o}f T/axation answered the reporters that i$n order to maintain the stability of the policy, t<h<e next step in implementing the new Individual Income Ta\x Law will consider continuing to make preferential arrangements fo-r foreigners, including H!on!g Kong, Macao and Taiwan.
Some reporters as,ked that the newly re:vis:ed Individual I>ncome Tax Law will adjust the criterion for res'i'dent ta&xpay&ers of Ch'in'a ’ s Individual Income Tax Law from one year to 183 d|ays.
`[` M{ay I ask if there are a:ny preferential arrangements for foreigners, including Hong Kong, Macao and Taiw<an, i!n implementing this n%ew law?"
The pr[inci[pals responded that the current e@ffe@ct@i@ve Individual Income Ta/x Law ’ s enforcement r?egu?la?tions have speci/al preferential p>rovisio>ns for taxation issues for foreigners . For individuals who do not have a r-esid-ence i=n China but have liv|ed for more than on#e year a\nd less than five years and earn incomes from outside China, their part of th{e payment b_y domestic uni`ts or individuals is subject to individual in@come tax.
The principals s)aid that in order to maintain the st@abi@li@ty of the policy, the next step in impl^ementing the ne"w Individual Income T:ax L-aw will consider continuing to make prefe<re<n<tial arrangements for foreigner~s, including Hong Kong, Macao a^n^d Taiwan.
The confinement center without "threshol;d": qu%a%l%ity cer>tifica>tion would promote the quality.
As th}e `}` two-child economic" develops and the m#atern#al and child market thrives, various grades of confinement ser.vice cen@t@er@s appeared a[round China, from B'e'ij'ing, Shanghai and Guangzhou t<o the 3rd and 4th tier cities.
T&he popu]l]ar confinement service centers, which could satisfy t+he consumer '&s demands, charged from t\e\ns of thousands of y;uan t*o hundreds of thousands o`f yuan . However, they were i+n an awkward situati:on, because this kind of institu&tion had no threshold at all, an%d there was still the There is still a blank zone i>n regulation.
Recently, the State Admin)i)stra)t)ion for M=ark=et Regu+l+at+io+n carried out a series of activities of 2018 National "Quality Month". The reporter c(ame to a five-star conf'i'neme'nt center in Ti'a'njin to explore the certification o<f maternal a#nd chi"ld care services.
A common confinement center provi!ded the services o*f newborn ca!re, nutritious food, and postpartum reconstruction, e]t]c.
The reporter found in this confinement center that t\he nurses w%ould c@heck the newborn breastfeeding each day, and the professional nursing workers would provide t>he newborns wi+t+h t'he careful nursing s\ervice\s, such as bathing a^nd touching.
In order to satisfy the ne|w mother ':s demand, i)t would provide the wound care in t<he beginning of confinement, bodybuilding care in the middle and later periods of confinement, Chines%e trad/itional cosm;eti;c tre)a)t)ment and other nursing items to help th.e new mother resto}re her g(ra(cefu(l figure.
A new mot$her there told the reporter that s`he had booked this conf)in)ement service cent]e]r 8 months in advance.
The service items of conf.in.emen.t service center would directly impact th~e parturient's com|for|t and body recovery during t\h\e confinement . Some small confinement service centers could o|nl|y provide some simple services during th?e co`nfin`ement, but ther%e were many problems and hidden troubles, inc*luding the irregular s]ter]ilizatio]n and sanitation, incidental cross infection, limited and unsc"ientific di~et, et.c.
The responsible person of this confinement center s;aid tha`t they were the o\nl\y one five-star c^on^fine^me^nt c;ente;r in Tianjin, wh%ich had been certified as a Grade B s+er+v+ice provider.
`{` Some customers did n'$t understand the meaning of th>e Grade B certification at first, but the fact forcing the enterprises to st:r:ictl:y impl#e#men#t the s#tan#da#rd#ized process management through certification will benefit the customers . It is i(m(por(tant for th?e long-term de$velopment of enterprises. `!` he said.
P}an Lifen, t~he deputy director o=f the Attestation Supervision Department of the S,tate Administration for Market Regulation, said that the service certification was a new kind of certification system, which was based o|n the customers' perception a>nd focus\ed on the organizational qu+al+ity management and satisfaction of service characteristics . It was a[n important part o(f the na_t_ional quality infrast(ructu(re, and had a positive effects on increas?in?g the proport<ion o%f quality services and e<n<han<cing China's int)ernati)ona)l service competitiveness.
After more than 10 years of developm^ent since 2004, the service certification project in our co\unt\ry had g$one through a process of devel-o-pi-n-g from scr-atch . A series o&f in&fluentia&l service certification h_ad appeared, including th!e financial service certification, mother and baby nur{sing service certification, after-sales servi)ce certification, electronic commerce service certification, an?d he@alth care service certification.
According to th\e stat'is'tics of the State Administration for Market Regulation, there are m~ore than 130 service certification institutions with over 2000 se|rvic|e certification staff and near?ly 80>00 valid a!uthen!tication certificates a;t present in our country.
P:an Lifen said that it was necessary t'o further guide and promote the development of ser(vice certification, gradually extend the co^ve^ra^ge of service certification in t\he fields o|f health, education, sports, finance and e#lec#tronic commerce, and b-oos-t t+he supply-side reform and quality en@hancement in the s}ervi}ce industry.
R@epo@r@t o]f Reuters on November 5 in Ho]n]g Kong: the propert-y pric{e in Hong Kong fell for t"wo consecutive months after peaking . Che!n Delin, t"he president o%f th}e Hong Kong Monetary Authority, said on Monday that it needed time to observe whe%ther the pr|operty market had enter*e*d downturns . If c{onfirmed, it can be considered to successively ease the tightening policy of counter-cyclical measures at an ap<pro<pr<iate time.
Ch@en Del?in also pointed out that if the property price f\ell, the first to be a/f/f/e/ct/ed would b^e t,h,os,e who bought properties at the peak of the property mar,ket, but i.t was expected that there would be le,ss opportunities to o#ccur the situation like sharply falling property prices and the properties s%ubsta%ntially sold b`y the citizens during th'e Asian Fi{nan{cial Crisis in 1997.
When leading mul;tiple senio@r leaders of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority to a)ttend the brief%ing session of the legislative session, Chen Delin s!aid that if the pro'p'erty market was determined to enter downturns, the ease of measures ca,n be ma.de i(n succession a]t an appropriate time.
"However, si/n/c/e da\ta of a few weeks only can currently be se`en, it's still too early to ea;se, and i]t needs more time t>o s@ee whether th]e property market is entering downturns. "
Since O[ctobe[r 20/09, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority has successively launched eight rounds of counter-cyclical measures to sub&sta&ntially tighten th=e mortgages of vari?o?us proper:ties, includ}in}g reduction o=f the number of mortgages, a]n]d that the m?ortg?age applicants have to pass rigorous stres?s tests, in order t]o improve the bank risk management and shock resistance.
A$s Hong Kong formally entered the interest-rate ri|s|e cycle, t+he house price index of private houses i-n Hon}g K{ong peaked for two consecutive months i)n August and September and then fell, and t(he m!o!nthl!y decline in September even expanded to 1.44%.
However, the cumulative increase in the fi]rst three qua>rte>r>s of this ye^ar was still 1~0.~2%.
Accor$di$n$g t(o the data of th!e Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the household financial conditions for the ability of Hong K(ong t&o withstand financial r/isks were measured to be healthy . In the second quarter this year, th~e percentage o.f households o,f self-occ$upation non-mortgage residence in Hong Kon%g was 66%, which was highe<r than the average of 6&0% in 2009-2011; the av-erage lo/a/n-/t/o-/v/alue ratio of the n}ewly app*r*ove*d mo=r=tg=age an#d the percentage of contribution and income of the newly appr:ove:d mortgage wa\s 47% and 34% res}p}ectivel}y, with obvious improvement compared with 64% and 41% in 2009-2011.
However, C?hen Delin said that h*i*gh shock resistance didn ’ t me@an the citizens who ha<d bought properti)es wou!ldn ’ t be suffered damag@e of financial downturns, since the property valuation would fal<l, and tho_se who bought properties at pe*ak times wo[uld be the first to be affected.
Although the Hong Kong Monetary Au\t\hority tightened the len{ding of the bank to the mor^tg^age borrowers, th/os/e who bought properties can also get a high-percentage mortgage loan by me"an"s o;f the mortgage insurance, the m@ortgage loan provided by th*e develope@r and so o+n.
Chen Delin said that currently together with the mortgage loan provided b-y the developer, the mortgage pe^rcen^tage o=f the borrower can reach 85-9&0% . If t]he property price fell by 10%, there w;ou;l;d b,e negative assets (i.e . the market v~alue of t{he pr<operty fel\l below the leve<l of the t`ot`al outstanding mortgage loan).
However, Ruan Guoheng, th{e vice pre"side"n"t of th&e Hong Kong Monetary Authority pointed out that t:he Authority estimated t>h>e total high-percentage mortg{age loan provid|e|d by the developer t"o account for 2-2.5% o+f the total mortgage of t"h"e bank, with lower proportion.
At the peak time o$f negative assets in Ho&ng Kong in 2?003, the number of negative assets exceeded 100_,00_0, with proportion o$f 22% i\n those who took mo|rtgag|e.
As o*f the th[ird quarter of this year, Hong Kong recor%d%e%d zero negative asset for seven con*se*cutive quarters.
Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, October 1 (reported by Li]u Hongxia & M<a Rui)--The electronic commerce ret;ail export enterprises received another benefits i:n the aspect o.f tax b,urden o-n October 1s,t, concerni%ng value-added tax and consumption tax e`x`emptio`n, etc.
The M*i*ni*s*try of Fina,nce, the State Administration o`f Taxa^tion, the Ministry of Commerce, a|nd the General Admi~ni~str~ati~on of Customs issued a jo"in"t statement a few days ago t\o clarify that th&e v,alue-ad,ded tax and consumption tax exempti"on policy would be piloted for the goods, which were exported by th~e e:lect:r:onic commerce export enterprises in the comprehensive pilot region for cross-boarder electr^on^ic commerce without any valid purchase certificates but met the follo;win;g c<o<nd<ition<s.
Firstly, the electronic commerce export ent^erprises registered in the comprehensive pilot region and registered the export date, name o.f goods, unit of me*asurement, quantity, un%it pri(ce, and amount o/n th{e online integrated service plat<fo<rm for cr=os=s-b=o=a=rder elect:ro:ni:c commerce in the registration place.
Secondly, the electronic c=o=mmerce e[xport declaration was f*ile*d for the ex]p]ort]ed goods at the Customs i!n the location of the comprehensive pilot region.
Thirdly, t}he export goods were not the goods, f/or which the export rebates (exemptions) wer}e clearly canceled by the Ministry of Finance and th}e State Administration of Taxation i!n accordance w.ith deci=sion of th\e State C}ouncil.
The n'oti'ficatio'n clarified that the General Admin>i>s>tra>tio>n of Customs wou|l|d transmit the electronic infor$ma$tion on electronic co=mmerc=e export goods declaration to the State Administration of Taxation a*t regular intervals.
The ta]x auth$oriti$es in the comprehensive pilot regions would strengthen the tax exemption management for export g+oods based o?n the electronic information on e=xport goods declaration pr@ov@i@de@d b)y the State Administration of Taxation.
A/cco/rd/i/ng t[o the notification, the specific tax exemption management me{a{sur{e{s would be fo/rmulated by t^he provincial tax departments and commercial departments.
T&he con]structio]n leading group offices of the comprehensive pilot regions and departments o+f commercial administration should coordinate and promote the comm$un$i$cation and collaboration between departments and the implementation of po)licies, accelerate the establishment of t<he stat>i>s>t>ical monito"ring system of electronic commerce e}x}port, and promote the sound an{d rapid de$ve$lopment of cross-boa(rde(r electronic commerce.

ECNS, Shenzhen, October 1 (reported by Zheng Xiaohong, Xu Dia/n/wei & Liu Shumeng) -&- It was the first day o+f the National D:ay "Golden Week '{' in the mainland on October 1 . A>nd it wa,s also the last day o"f t^h^e Nat(ional D=ay publ~ic ho&l&iday in Hong Kong . Ma-n-y mainland residents used this holiday to travel and go shopping across the border, whi'le many Hong K)ong residents returned to Hong Kong after visiting Shenzhen . The passenger volume o{f Shenzhen ports was "full to bursting", a.nd the ports in Luohu and Shenzhe/n B_ay had newly opened 22 automated g[a[tew[ays . This woul|d improve t*he clearance e$ffici$ency in ports and facili-ta-te the passengers t>o be cleared b$y the customs effectively and rapidly.
According to the data provided by Shenzhen General Stat[ion of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection, over 42!9!00!0!0 p*e*opl*e and over 168000 vehicles had been transported across the b"o"ar"der by 16:00 that afternoon . The p"o"rts had al|wa|y|s been busy and or@derl@y w(i(t(h a good order o%f e@nt@r@y and e\xi\t.
It was learned that there were an increasing number o/f passengers taking ad(vant(age o>f t$he National Day ho.liday to visit the countries in Europe an.d Southeast Asia to go shopping af&fe&cte&d by many po*si*tiv*e factors, such as th+ere were mo/re co*untri*es providing the visa-free policy for the Chinese citizens.
T}he passenger (car) flow peak i:n the exit direction in t`he ports in L?uohu, Shenzhen Bay, Huanggang, and Futian occurred in the morning of Oc*tober 1 . The pa.ss.e.n.g.er flow peak i+n Luohu po{rt lasted from 9}:00 am to 11:00 am, an=d the pa$sseng$e$r (car) flow peak i{n Shenzh~en B-ay port lasted from 6:30 am to the noon at 13:00.
According to the introduction, in order to cope with passenger (car) flow peak across the boarder, Shenzhen General Station of Exit and Entry Frontier Inspection followed the unified deployment o|f t#he S#ta#te Immigration Admini#str#at#io#n t`o start the servi{ce mode of passenger (ca,r) f=lo=w peak period, arrange th>e policemen to work overtime to sup~po~r~t those wo]r]k]ing in the fro}nt-line o^n duty, open enough passages f"or inspection and examination in advance, ensure that the que#ueing time of Chinese ci^tizen '(s exit and entry woul]d not exceed 30 minutes while taking into account of the foreigner's clearance eff&ic&iency; the order maintenance in the crowded wa&s enhanced, and the c`u`stoms c!learan!ce wa\s ens&ured t`o be safe an%d orderly.
Shenzhen Genera#l St;at;ion of Exit a)n)d Entry Frontier Ins>pection also reminded the travelers across th)e boarder to pay attention to the expiry dates o;f their certificates, visas, and endorsements before t/heir trips, ma.ke the travel ar#ra#nge#me#nt in a reason{a{b{le way, try to avoid t[he passeng\er flow peak period and choose a right time and a right port to trav]el.
The passengers headed for Hong Kong via Guangzhou-Shen\zhen-Hong Kong Express Rail Link mu\s\t take their valid exit & entry documents, visas and endorsements . The high-`s`p`eed rail ticket could be used as a pr|oof o'f payment only, but not t@he exit a\nd entry c$er$tif$ic$ate . A+nyone, who co*ul*dn't go t-o Hong Kong acr&o&ss th-e boarder due to the reasons such as the doc!ument!s and procedures we{re not satisfiable, should fol`l`ow the guide of the policeman o{n duty i\n the Frontier Inspection, and go to the designated sit}e to wait for the staff of M(TR corporation to g/ui/de them to g$o thro>ugh th/e procedures of returning the mainland by train.
Systemic lupus erythema$t$os$us i+s a chronic and stubborn disease involving multiple organs o<f the body . It used t-o be considered as an "i^ncurab^le dise/ase".
Because its pathogenesis is un$k$now$n, d`iag`no`si`s and treatment are difficult, and there is lack o&f effective treatment, it is hard t`o cure once a`nd for a,l,l.
Recently, Liu Wanli, a researc{her a?t the Scho%ol of Life Sciences, Tsinghua Un/iversity, and Li Zh}ang}uo, director of the Rheum^ati^s^m and Immunity Cen+ter at Peking University People ’ s Hospita!l, together with their teams discover"ed the existen#ce of human immune globulin can increase the molecular variation of s_y_st_emic lupu)s erythematosus susceptibility, and this k^ind o]f variation is involved in the regulation of imm+une B cells.
In short, the two team`s confirmed tha-t an abnormal im[m[une molecule in t^h^e human body is a+n i;mport;a;nt cause of the onset of systemic lupus erythematosus.
A}c}cor}ding to Sun Xiaolin, one o%f t@he authors and me-m-ber of Peking University People ’ s Hospital, the team of Li Zhanguo co*ll*ect*e*d nea,rly 2,000 large samples of patients with systemic l\u\pu\s erythematosus to make stud]y . It was found t\ha\t pati)en)ts wit.h immune globulin variations produced pathopoiesis cells and a w^ide va}riety of nu*me*rous autoantibodies . The incidence and severity of nephr#itis, arthritis, orrhomeningitis vasculitis and other inflammations are si`gn`ificantly increased.
Through var(io(us research methods such as immune cell tr'aci'ng, anim#al testing, and sequencin`g, Liu Wanli team found that the i+mmu+ne molecule varia,tio,n activates the immune signaling pat)hway and t#he pathogenic mechanism of pro%m%o%ting B cells secreting various autoantibodies.
The report;er learned tha,t the powerful combination between two teams gave full play t?o their res*p*ect*ive advantages and achieved a close integration between basic research a:nd cl{inical application.
Liu Wanli team is committed to B lymphocyte immune recognition an"d immune activation research, and the L(i Zhangu"o team h?as lo=ng been engaged in clinical research on s\ystemic lup,u,s erythematosus.
"This r/es/ea/r/ch is one of the results of years of cooperation between the t`w`o teams . It is also the first t)ime in th=e academic community t[o re"co"gnize t?ha?t immune globulin gene abnormalities will induce systemic lupus erythematosus, which l@a@ys a solid foundation for fur<t<her academic research and clinica^l targeted therapy. `:`
T*his is not s)h)ield mistakes, but act}ing by law.
Lawyers took a<n axe t!o the court?
The news was r>eally exciting a]t first glance, and i#t also cau$sed a great disturbance in t|h|e legal circle.
Fujian Quanzhou In[termedi[at[e Peopl-e ’ s Court subseq`u`ently f}ine}d t-he lawyers for 500 y/uan and proposed in writing to the Quanzhou Lawyers Association to investigate and handle.
According to the Beijing N[ews, the Quanzhou Lawyers Association issued a formal notice that the behaviors of the two law]y]ers did no/t involve violations of laws an%d regulations a?nd we|re not punished according t?o la*w.
According t^o the multi-party reports, t?he handling o(f th^e Quanzhou Lawyers Association i~s not a shortcomings protection or confrontation, but has be\en approved by th_e Quanzhou Intermediate People ’ s Court.
An event that could have caused tens^ion within t"he l,egal c]omm]u]nity was eventually resolved properly.
T[he reversal o^f the event st.ems f^rom the more completed truth restoring: the axe carried by the lawyer inv{olved is the same type and sa)m)e m,odel as the de:f:e:ndant ’ s we,apon, but it i%s not put th_e first edge . It o+nly serves a_s secondary evidence in the evidence-proven and cross-examination link, and ther;e is no threatening acts or the subject intention of "endangering th"e court security".
Judging whether the behav>iors o-f the la-wyers involved is illegal or not, t"here a`re four very important details to be co{ncern{ed . First, the local court h?as twice held the co=urt and o|nly showed a photo of th@e axe . Fr~om the perspective of defense, it is necessary to show t:he original axe . Sec@ond, the axe is purchased on]e hour befor\e the court open . It is n?ot that the lawyer i:s not wi-lling to seek the judge ’ s consent, but it is n:ot able t*o contact the judge o~bj~ect~i~v~ely . T]hir]d, the axe has not been used i`n an e@xcessive or imp~rope~r manner . Fourth, the lawyers admitted the mistake in public and immediately apologized to the c.our.t.
Based on these plots, it can b)e se$e$n t"h"at the lawyers who "took axe to appear in court" have n<ot<h<in<g to d*o the devi+l things, but just t-o make defense.
After clarifying the whole fac!ts, the Quanzhou La%wyers Association did not follow th:e societal discussion, but re!sisted the pressure and m+ade a decision no.t to impose penalties.
An.d th*i*s decision can withstand the test o+f facts and laws.
As taking the axe as the co"n"t"roll"e"d knife to the court without the pe(r(missio(n o_f t|he court, it is ea's'y t'o cause anxiety and misunderstanding.
F}or the sake of s[a[fety and c<au<tiou<s, Quanzhou Intermediate P.e.ople ’ s Cour(t ’ s previous fine punishment and judicial advice are also und.ers.t.an.dabl.e.
I-n ord<er to maintain the dignity of lawyers and prevent se:veral courts from finding excus^es to purposely make difficulties fo<r la,w,yer,s, the Supreme La\w promulgated the "Rules on Se}c}uri}ty Checks by J~u~d~icial Policemen o[f the People ’ s Courts" in 2014, establishing th:e principles that lawyers do not n+eed to conduct per>so>nal security check in court.
Sin\ce th-e issuance of t!he Rule, law>ye>rs have se$t examples, and there have b.een few incidents endangering the court security happened due to the omissions of securi$t$y checks.
In such a very rare case ha#ppe#ned i!n Quanzhou, as lo*ng a\s we communicate in a spirit of mutu?a?l res%p%ect and understanding, misunderstanding is no't difficult to eliminate.
A>s a self-|reg|ulator|y organization in the la=wyer profession, the Lawyers Associ-ation bears the dual mission of discip=li=ni=ng against law a`nd safeguard the legitimate rights.
In the past, individual L{awyers Association organizations have been blamed f]or their emphasis on d?isciplinary ac,ti,o,n and their lo~ss of safeguard.
T)he decision of th$e Quanz|ho|u Lawyers Association is worthy o_f praise both in terms of pro+ces+s and results, a"nd it sets an example for more lawyers association to perform their duties corr+ectly.
Which ta[x benefits wi?l?l affect our money bag f,rom October 1?
Xinhua N-e-ws Agency, Shanghai, October 1 (reported by San_g Tong)--The New Individual Income Tax Law will be implemented fr?om January 1, 2019 . In orde.r to have th$e broad masses of the pe]o]ple en*joy th*e benefits of tax reduction as so]o]n as possible, the tax will fi)rst)ly b*e deducted from taxpayers' actual j#ob salaries base^d on the mi!ni!mu!m threshold of 5000 yuan per month fro@m October 1, 2019, and the ne-w ta{x rate schedule will be appl^ied.
With th:e implementation of new policy, which benefits will reall*y aff%ect the people's money ba.g?
T]he first be:nefit: the incom&e tax will be reduced significantly in the j~o~b salaries.
Th~e taxpayer receiving the j&o&b salaries after October 1 ca`n have the b?asi?c deduction of fees deducted based on the threshold of 5000 yuan per mont!h, and the new tax rate sch.edul.e will b?e applied . Mo#st of the taxpayers will enj~oy different levels of ta_x reduction, especially the lower and middle'-inco'me people, who wi$l$l s]e]e more significant tax reduction.
According to the tax reduction fa)c)t s)h)eet of dif,ferent income groups, for th%e peop_le whose month&ly income will be 8000 yua<n, 10000 yu&an, 20000 yuan, and 50000 y^u^an after deducting the `"` three insurances a|nd one fund", the taxable amoun\ts after t@he tax reform will be 90 yuan, 290 yuan, 1590 yuan, an&d 9090 yuan respectively . Compared wi!th t[h[e monthly thresh>ol>d of 3500 yuan, the co]rrespondin]g tax re~d~uction ratio is 73.9%, 61.1%, 49.0%, 18.8% respectively.
It is worth noting that due to hol$ida$ys, the new basic deduction of fe&es and ta-x rat:e schedule c.an be applied to th}e salaries that should be paid by t.h.e un\it\s in October but have be>en paid at the end o@f September according to laws.
For t[his purpose, th[e withholding c,l,ien,t sof+tw+are, which is uniformly promoted and used b|y the tax department, has pro.vi.ded the co\rres\pon\di\ng tax calculation function, but the corresponding tax still needs to be declar^e^d and paid during the statutory dec&la&ra&tion period.
T\he second benefit: th:e gaps between grades o:f low tax rates will b.e obviously widened.
In a#d#dition t"o raising the threshold, th;e new tax rate schedule wi#l#l be applied from October 1.
Th_is time, seven grades of tax rates o,f job salaries are th'e same as before without an)y c|ha|nge|s, bu:t t{h{e gaps between grades o:f tax rates a\re obv@iously changed . Th>e gaps between three grades of low ta|x rates i[n 3%, 10% and 20% are obviously widene_d, the gap of the grade of t/ax rate in 25% i"s slightly narrowed, but the gaps between t@hree grades of high tax rates in 30%, 3'5% and 4|5% are the same as before.
It is worth noting that the tax law has al~so a"djusted the grades of tax rates fo"r income from production and b[usine[ss operation, and the lower li"mi"t of th~e highest grade of tax r:at:e in 35% h^a^s been increased from 0.1 mi{llion yu]an to 0.5 million yuan.
This means that the individual businesses and personal exclusive in&vestme&n&t enterprises will be@nef@i@t f]rom this t<ax reform.
"Fr{om the perspective o-f measurement an$d calculation of pers.onal ta%x reduction for Shanghai taxpayers in the ea(rl(i(er s+tage, the broad masses o<f taxpayers will fully experience t'he benefits of the personal i@nc@o@me tax refo)rm, especially the lower and middle-income people, who will see more significant tax reduction. "
Lan Min, the hea.d of Personal Income Tax Division o:f Shanghai Tax Bureau of t:h:e State A>d>ministration of Taxation, sa(id.
The thi{rd benef<it: the tax service will be.come more convenient and optimized.
Shanghai tax departmen!ts have carried o(ut a series of comprehensive activities of tax propag@a@nd@a since the announcement o;f the new personal inco}me tax law.
On the one h]and, they provided t#he policy g>uida>nc>e on "one-to-one & point-to-point" for the important tax so,ur,c,es and i!m!po!rtant enterprises.
Pudong New Area T~ax Bureau has vis|ite|d Apple Trading (Shanghai) C@o., L*td., Alipay (China) Network Technology Co., Ltd., Red Star Mac@a@llin@e Group Corporation Ltd. and other large enterprises successively . T?hese enterprises have a large number of employees and a large a@mount of works in withholding and r=e=mitting tax, so the tax department actively provided coaching a%n%d answered questions; Xuhui District Tax Bureau has vis.it.ed some lar>g>e labor serv=ice enterpri)se)s, including CIIC Financial Con\sulting Ltd+. and CI^IC Sh%anghai Economic a$nd Technical Cooperation Ltd. wi>thin the district . I_t collected t*heir concerned p*roble*ms, responded to their a~ppea~ls, and resolved their diffi~c~ul~t~ies in a timely way.
On t@h@e other hand, they implemented the "comprehensive, multidimensional and stereoscopic" tax poli%cy promotion f%or th%e citizen ta^xp^ayers.
They u.sed S=han=h=a=i Tax official website, WeChat official account, M"icroB"log an@d other resources to post t%he hot topics and ensured t;hat the policy announcements were in place.
At the same time, Shanghai Tax WeChat official account has put the 12366 Intelligent Consulting Platform s\i\nce September 28 . I't would carry out th=e `~` ta+rg+et+e+d '@' int:e:grat:ed intelligent services of personal income tax reform via th=e "Human+Intelligence '&' ta!x service consultation.

The annual Yan<gc<he<ng Lake Crab Culture Tourism Festival kicked off on the 30th . According to Gu Wenhua, secretary of t/he Party C~om~mittee of Bacheng Town, the `{` hometown of Yangcheng Lake hairy cr*abs", th$e annual economic o@utput of the hairy crabs in the tow%n is nearly 3.8 billi(on y\uan and t_he net earning is ov_er 60"0 million yuan.
The Yangcheng Lak_e hairy cra)b is also known a%s the "golden cla)w cr-a-b". Because the crab body is not mudd_y, it i"s com]mo]n]ly k=n=own as the clear water hairy crab . It has green shell and white belly, with good meat quality and greasy crab cream . Therefore, i?t has th`e reputation of `^` kin,g o]f the crab".
Eating crabs during the M@id Autumn Day with or+ange osmanthus fragrance has be+come a customary conven?tion.
The hairy cr(ab is the m>ost famous image spokespe*rson in Bacheng.
Peel<ing cr*ab shells, sucking c#rab feet, picking cra(b meat, and dipping in crab sauce, diners feel the beauty of being i$n the re)gion)s south of t/h/e Yangtze River.
According to crab farmer Jin Wei, m?ore diners will spend more time st.a.y.i.ng in B{achen{g t(hi(s year . On the edge of the vast Yangcheng L!ake, watch th*e e^g^rets prey, enjoy the sunse#t, experience the fun o[f catching crabs, and e*njo*y the slow-paced w?ater town life.
Du$e t;o t%he widespread introduction of large sized offspring seedlings in Bacheng, the hair(y cr~abs that have been out o&f the w-at-er this year are much larger than before.
Crab farmer Chang Jianhua, who has been i>n hairy crab^s ind~ustr~y for nearly 20 years, is planning to export th}e seedlings and breed<i<ng techniques o=f Yangcheng La@ke hairy crabs t#o Thailand, so that t?he waterside foods can cross n;ati;o;nal borders and promote cultural exchanges with o^verseas cuisine.
"K`u`n O,pera Town" is a cultural highlights in Bac(heng.
A&t p<resen<t, Bacheng has bui\lt f=ive cra,b markets of Crab Boat Garden, Fis"hmen Village, Spring an_d Autumn Waterside Town, Lakeside Crab mark|et, Zhengyi Bajiexie Market and foo|d str(e(et . There are as ma$ny as 1,300 large and s~mall restaurants used Yangcheng Lake h.airy crabs as topic . The crab restaurants placed c~l~os~e~ly side by side are very fascinating, and the heavy traffic on the street at the p_eak of the p`as`sengers has become a un$iqu$e landscape.
Gu Wenhua introduced that, "One Crab" attracts nearly 3 million tourists from hom}e an?d abroad every year, and also forms the Bac-heng with t?wo horizontal and tw:o vertical and li%vely ol<d stre]ets.
Baxi Post K`u`n Opera Th'eme P?o?st Office, Shihua C+oncep+t Book Bar, Opera Baby Theme Image Shop, Kun Opera Theme B & B, Embroidery Hall, Cheongsam Hall and many other tourism products h]a]ve appeared one a:fter another . A group of celebrity s)tudio)s such a(s Kun Opera scholar Yang Shousong, flute master Chen Dongbao, f,amous K/un Opera male role Yu Jiul-in, bamboo carv"i"ng master N[i Xi`aoz`hou a{nd folk song inheritor Lu Zhenliang have settled i\n, and t/he ol?d street has become t,he cultural core area of `#` Kun Opera T]o]wn", Bacheng.
It is reported that during th&e Crab Culture To'urism Festival, the 4th Kun Opera Town and Ba#che#ng Double Ninth Festival Perform_ance w[ill also be reopened, and the Kun Opera lovers fro'm all o:ver th=e world will gath%e%r together to review th'e prosperity of Yushan Scholar Gathering.

T`he United States, Canada a)n)d Mexico have concluded a tri[lateral trade agreement, and it will bring new opp$or$tunitie$s t.o 500 million people.
According to foreign me?dia reports, the joint state%ment by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Can$ada Freeland and the United States Trade Representative Lighthizer, which was published on th_e Canadian government website, indicat~e~d that the United States, Canada and Mexico had reached a trilat+eral trade agr.e.em.ent, which was calle$d "USMCA '`' (T'h'e Un(ited S"tat"e"s-Mexic"o-C"anada Agre*eme*nt).
The C/TV Ne/ws Chann)el i.n Canada previously quoted the message fr@om the United States senior source saying t%ha%t Canada and the Uni+t+e+d States had settled differences and conc{lu{ded an agreement on the North American Fre*e Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
The Washington Post quoted two sources with k=nowle=dge of the situat!io!n s|aying th!at the agreement concluded b#y the United State and Canada on S<ept<embe<r 30 would keep the NAFTA a|s a trilateral trade agreement, and t[h[e three head would sign a n`e`w agreement withi-n 2 months.
Th%e state-me-nt sai*d: `.` Canada, the Uni}ted States and Mexico con)clude a new trade a-greeme-nt today -'- `/` T"he United States-Mexico-Canada Agr(eement" (USMCA), whi^c^h w#i#ll provide a high-standard trade agreement for our workers, farmers and compa;ni;es . It will contribute to the freer marke)ts, the fairer t<rades, and the more ore sustainable economic gro:wt:h . The agreement will s,trengthen the middle class, create the high-paying job opportunities and bring new opportunities to about 500 million people. "
It i!s rep;orted that th'e existing North American Free Trade Agreement w"as signed by the United State)s, Mexico and Canda in 1994.
After taking office a*s president, Trump a[nno[unced that he planned t$o reconsider this agreement and si=gn a new agre"ement.
T&he three countries have started the negotiation pro}gre}ss o>f it since 2017.
The result of the Ele,ct,ion of Okinawa G'overnor, which was conducted ahead of schedule because the for<m<er governor On|aga Takeshi had died of illne~s~s, was announced o_n October 1 loc.al time . Denny Tamaki, who opposed the plan of relocating t#he US military base in Ja)pan, wa|s elected suc[cessfully.
This election was voted on September 3;0 . The fina.l result showed that Tam{aki had 39663'2 votes, which was the most votes made in the h`ist`ory o~f the Election of Okinawa Gov]e]rn]or . H]e had over 80000 more votes t$ha$n his major o\pp\onent Atsushi Sakima.
A total of 4 ca{n{d{ida{t{es participated in this election, and t"he vot$ing rate was 63.24%, which w=as 0.89% lower t'ha'n that o<f t*he Election of Okinawa Governor in 2014.
Tamaki told the media on October 1 that the result o"f e,lection showed that the Okinawa people did n'<t want to waste the former governor Onaga Takeshi '}s efforts during hi\s lifetime, and he would carry ou)t Takeshi's behests t~o make continued efforts i,n opposing the plan o'f relo"cating t}he US milit,a,ry base and the closure of th.e F>ut>en>ma base t=o the Japanese government and the American government.
T'he Futenma base is located in Ginowan in Okinawa Prefecture, an\d it has b%e%en criticized all the tim;e . The Japa}nese government and t'h'e Americ*an govern\ment have agreed to reloca'te it t<o Henoko in Nago, but the Ok(in(a(wa people strongly oppose this a.ctio.n and hope to move the base completely out of Okinawa.
For t+he relocation plan strongly o>pposed by Okinaw!a people an_d th^e request to cancel th`e permit fo*r land reclamation along the coa?st o}f Henoko, Tamaki said that he didn't stand on the opposite and divisive ground against the central government at t"h"e beginning . He h{o{ped that both sides could fully exchange views, show t|he intention to solve the pr.obl.ems thro|ug|h negotiation.
Japanese President Shinzo Abe also told the me:dia in the morning of October 1 tha(t h@e would seriously accept this resu>lt and make eff,o,rts to revitalize Okinawa and reduce t+he burden on th&e base.
Yoshihide S!uga, the Chi:ef Cabinet Secretary of Japan, said in the press conference on October 1 t?hat th"e government's policy of reloc(ating the US base as so-on as possible had no#t been c-hang-e-d at all.
A*nd he also expresse`d his intention to talk with T{amaki.
Tamaki wil;l officially take up his dutie/s a`s the governor of Okinawa.
Sin)c)e the mid-2000s, with Ch+ina ’ s incr<e<asi<ng needs f^or oilseeds, Paul Thomas, a farme]r in North Dakota, has g?rown more and mor|e soybeans in his field.
T|his t"r"an"sition reaches the peak this year . H}e has grown 1,600 acres of soybean@s in the 5,000-acre land, reaching a}n unprecedented scale
However, in 2019, Thomas and many far.me.rs like him plan to s~witch production to the staple crops in the f@o@rm@er U.S$. agricultural r%egion, such a#s corn a\nd wheat.
T$he area of soybeans grown b#y Am\erica\n farmers exceeds that of corn this year, which i,s for the first time i(n 35 years.
The reas)on why t|he farmers p;l;an to switch production to other crops i<s that American farmers face difficulties in selli&ng soybeans in t=he context of the trade war launched b^y President Trump against China.
China usually purchases around 60% of soyb>eans exported f(ro(m Ameri%ca, but b`ecause of the trade war, the purchases o$f American soy:beans are nearly zero in recent months, leadin$g to a 10-year low in soybean pric^e^s.
Thomas plans to g*row more wheats next year and hopes t%o earn more by re'ducin'g dependence on crops that rely o\n C[hine[se demands.
Thom(as said that the soybean price "brings us a hea*vy blow '~'.
He said t[hat t;he sp=ot price of soybeans near his farm was $7.1{0 per bushel withou:t Chinese dem;an;ds, while the price needed for covering c~os~ts was $8.50.
The a.rea o\f soybeans grown by American farmers hits a high record a:nd the harvest is expected to h.i.t a h(igh record.
At such a v:ulne:rable tim*e, they are hit b'y the trade war.
As T\rump i,m,posed tariffs on the goods imported from China, China impo/se/s tariffs on th|e soy$beans imported from America in July.
The United S{tates Department of Agriculture wi-ll release th!e fi#rst estimated report of cultivated a^rea nex(t year, which is expected to include consideration of tariff effects.
This estimate is expected to confirm t:he expectations of non-governmental organizations tha=t the cultivated ar}ea of soybeans w@ill be r?edu?ced.
According to a report see|n b|y Reuters, on October 1$9, Inf{orma Economics predicted that the cultivated a!rea o-f c;orn;s would increas#e by 4% t%o 92.7 million acres (37;.5 million he_cta_res) and the cultivated area of soybeans would decrease by 7% to 83 million acres in 2019.
Informa also pre=d=ic=ted that the cultivated area of wh^eats in America wo[uld i!nc!rea!se by 4%.
The cultivated area o=f soybeans increases to 89.6 mill\io\n acres this year before ret%al%iatory tariffs ar-e implemented, which is about 1!5 million a.cr.es higher than that of 1)0 years ago.
The cultivated ar#ea of corn+s has increased by less than 5 million acr(es to 89.1 million acres si#nce 20*08 . The cu!lt!i!vated area o|f wh)eats is 47.8 mi-ll-ion acres this year, which is close to the lowest level in 100 years.
The total c[u[l[tivated area of the president of Illi?noi?s Corn Growers Associ;at;i;o;n Aron Carlson ’ s f~amily is 3,600 acres . He use:s nearly half o]f the land to grow s=oybe=a=ns, but he plans to m(ake reduction in t%h%e future.
He said that the cultivated area o!f corns in the f=arm in North Illinois woul^d increase by 20% at most; th}is state i's the larg>es>t soybean cu(l(tivat(io(n state in America.
The yields per acre of soybeans ar&e low!e!r than tha$t of corns, but less fertilizer is needed, which mak'es the c]ost of soy"bean cu{l{tivation relatively low as a whole.
If farmers switch pr?oducti?on to corns, th+e c/o/st may incre*as*e . But the fertilizer seller of And{e{rs{o{ns Inc and other enterprises may b'enefi't from it.
Pat Bowe, the CEO o_f Andersons said to R.eut.ers that he predicted that switching produ#ction to c]o]rns would be ben$ef$ic$i$al to fertilizer use.
Bay*er also p*redicts t=o benefit from farmers switching production to corns.

Xin>hua International Commentary: Defend Multila,t,e,rali,sm, China Fu?ll?y Honor Its Commitments.
Under the circumstance of unilateralism adverse current surging, interna)ti)ona)l rules and multi#later#a#l order h\ave b'een impacted.
To some extent, the confro|ntati|on between unilateralism and multilateralism ha:s entered into a cr[itical perio'd.
As a responsible great power, China h)as taken the i#dea o;f following the genera;l tendency an\d corresponding with major principles and t%he action with solid a-nd p+ower to maintain multilateralism with the international community and pro%mote multilateralism going ahead continuously.
Facing the new sit:uatio:n:s and new challenges, China h:as issued a loud voice o>n the development direction a;nd pa?th of multilateralism.
As Wang Yi, State Councilor an;d Foreign Minister, st,a,t,ed at the General Debate of the 73rd Session o^f the UN General A(sse(m(bly that mult)ilate)ra)lism i"n the new era should pursue t'he goal of win-win coo[per[a[tio[n, act upon ru?les and order, uphold fairness and justice, and a<ct t/o deliv-er real results.
A}t the same time, Ch%ina call:s for the establishment of a global develop<ment cooperation of making the U{nited Natio~ns as the cor%e, North-South cooperation a~s the main channel and South-South cooperation as the complement, and calls on all parties t"o wo|rk together to build a community with s!ha!red future for mankind.
China ’ s t[ho[ught and voice reflect t@he mainstream of the in?t?ernati?onal community.
A-s the President of the 73rd United Nation(s General Assembly Espinosa said, under the current s.ituat.io.n, "the United Nations ne&eds to d~evelop and expand multilateralism and mai[nt[ain a rul^es-ba^s^ed international system more th)an ever".
Lagarde, P're'si'dent of International Monetary Fu<nd, said that the international community should continue to f`i`r`mly uphold th=e multilateral tradi<n<g system, adhere to international trade rule*s, and res#olve differences through consultation.
In rec=en=t years, as the changes of glo,bal economy and political power balance, some newly-developing markets and developing countr%ies have emerged in groups, playing a gr-eater ro$le in th%e m/ajor inter:n:a:tiona:l multilateral mechanisms, and providing new developm+ent im'petus for the multilateralism that has suffered from t%he headwinds.
Thinking in t]his dimension, building a big family but n,o,t making up small circles, adhering to discussion an}d collaboration but not winner-take-all and other the multilateralism ideas advocated b{y China f=ol=low the trend o)f the times, t^hey are th]e inevitable choices t,o c.ope with global challenges and solve world problems, repr|esenting the common pursuit o[f the maj:ori:ty countries around th@e world.
Advanced i=dea with mo#re solid action.
China ’ s "One Belt On?e Road" has become th@e la@rgest international cooperation p,l,atform.
`=` On]e Belt O\n\e Road ')', Asian Inf}rastruct}ure Investment Ban-k, `}` 16+1 Cooperation" and other international and regional cooperation initiatives la]unched by China promote international c:oo:p:e:ra:ti:on, improve existing international systems and ord"e"r, and bri#ng innovation vitality to multilateral cooperation and make contribution to the development of the inter(nat(ional o$r$der in a more just and rational direction.
As the def}ender o~f t)he international order and the practitioner of multilateralism, China ’ s ac|t|i|on|s are becoming more and mor]e powerful in t.he multi*later*a*l stage of the United Nations.
Mediate heated-discussion international points, address climate changes, participate in peacekeeping o&pe&rations, vigorously r"edu"c"e po[v[ert[y and help the poor, an*d h:e:lp other countries i~mpleme~nt t]h]e 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
As Uni#ted Na\tions Secretary-General, Guterres said, China h/as become a[n important pillar of multilateralism.
When the "t#r#u#s#t deficit" f)aced by the world intensifies, whe&n Populism and polarization trends are on the rise, i?t i,s the most urgent moment that the world needs multila,tera,l coo_pe_ration.
At such a historical juncture, the international community need(s t}o join hands to t-ur-n conse,nsus into actions, resolut`ely defend multilateralism, and jointly promote the b=uildin=g of community with shared f=uture fo:r mankind.

For this, CCTV issue|d a quick comm}ent: this w/as the fi(rs(t Memorial Day after the implementation of the l"aw fo)r the protection o=f heroes and martyrs in China.
Five years ago, th@e Memor-ia-l D)ay was set up o&n the eve of the N^ational Day, m~ar~king the great course of the Ch@in@ese nation from suffering t<o glor'y . We must always be vigilant that `'` where we come from and where to go".

According to the incomplete stat]istics, around 20 million martyrs died heroically for n.ational independence, liberation of the peo*ple, prosperity of the c-ountry and th|e we>l>l-b>ei>ng of t=he people.
Ev<ery martyr who die~d for the country w;il;l be remembered, an[d every spirit of loyalty t-o the country will be respected.
To set up th|e national Memorial Day for t@he@m a\nd organize various forms of commemorative activit>i>es is to pay hom?age t]o th`em i>n the name of the countr?y, de^ep^ly remember their great achievements and lea"rn to pass on their precious spir/it of loving the motherland, being loyal to the people, selfless dedication and daring to sacrifice.
Party committees and governments at a'l'l levels have improved the pensi&on preferential treatment system a:n:d constantly raised the level o*f pens@ion treatment . The Party and the state have honored heroes wit_h concrete actio-ns.
Ev'ery year, coun/t/less people pay tribu_te to the ma]rt]yrs cemetery, which let us feel the deep people's feeling o)f the memory, and f+eel the power of revival ri*se*n from the national bloo]d.
Advocating, def]e]nding, learning from and caring for h}er}oes ha%s become a common practice in the wh]ole society.
The quick comment f(in(a(lly point,ed out that in th[e new era of socialism with Chinese characteristics today, we can comfort the dead an~d bu(ried he:ro:es and martyrs that a strong Ch[ina has been rising from the east, and th}e Chinese d*rea*m of th|e g+reat rejuvenation o|f the Chinese nation has been becoming a reality in our hands.

The fifth "Month of vocalization f,or the disabled" come(s; focus on the issue of sex educ"ation for disabl{ed teenagers - Ch>in>a News
In rece)nt years, t%he topic o\f sex education for Chines-e teenagers has be\en widely discussed, but the challenge for sex education f}or disabled teenagers is still arduous.
Recently, t"he se[mi[nar on ch=alleng=es and pr/a/c/tical strategies of comprehensive sex education for the disable/d was held in Beijing.
It is an major is#sue about how t,o carry out sex education fo>r disable,d children and young people in this s#eminar.
`&` The r*eport of sexual k$n$owled$ge, attitudes and b}ehavior}s of Chinese disa[b[le[d children a[n[d young people" released a^t the meeting reveals that the proportion of disabled ch_i_l_dren subjected to sexual harassment and abuse is higher than t?hat of healthy children.
Fo[r disable'd children and teenagers, wh-at the society focuses on i:s the attention of "sexual protection".
This seminar aims a(t promoting the comprehensive sex educat-i-on for disabled children and teen|age|rs in China f;r;om thr}ee aspects of family support, school education a+n+d institution se:rvices, providing s`upp`ort to the disabled children an(d teen$ag$ers from the source, thus letting them enjoy the right of lov^e as others do.
E}x}perts be-l-ieve that t-he Chinese public understanding of disabled groups has remained at a level that is not deep enough for a l#ong tim`e.
B]eing influenced by t&he traditional concept and other f#act#ors, the comprehensive s~ex education for the disabled, e~s~pecially fo=r the disabled children and teenagers in China, is not d/eep enough.
However, in r?ece?nt years, with the supp\ort of t?he UNESCO and public-spirited people, t$he practice and im\plementati\o\n path of full-cycle comprehensive sexual an=d repr-oductive health education for the disabled in China h-ave made gratifying progress.
`,` The report" shows that the children and young people wit`h visua/l impairment, hearing impairment, intellectual impai(r(me(nt and ph"ysic"al impairment have more difficulties in acquiring se+xual kn`owledge and unde+rs+ta+ndi+ng intimate relationship than the ordinary people, but t?hey ha>v>e generally developed towards convenience and enrichment.
"The seminar on challenges and practical st_rategi_es of comprehensive sex education for the disabled" i)s held by the Shanghai Youren Public Welfare Foundation and supported b>y th%e UNESCO Representative Office in China, th~e Beijing Represent"at"ive Office of t@he International League for Disabled Pers]ons (France) and th{e UNFPA Represent.ative Office i)n C*hi*na . Its purpose is to explore t<he practice a(nd imple%ment%a%t%i%on path of full-cycle comprehensive se$xual a"n"d reproductive health education for the disabled in t)he context o(f gr-and strategy of healthy C:h:ina, and p#r#om#ote the interested p\a\rties of policy makers, educators, re{searcher{s, social service organizations and parent!s ’ representatives in the field of special education and integrat,ed educatio!n to understand the i|n|t|ernatio|nal policy on c)omprehe)nsive sexual education and the right to health of disabled children and young people; the p.ractices, strategies, challenges and resources o)f sex education for disabled children an[d young people i~n China are widely exch(an(g(ed, and the way of comprehensive sex education f_or disabled c_hildren and young people in the future is disc^ussed a[nd a blueprint is set up to form a supp{or{t network.
Report of the Reuters on September 30 in Be-i-jing - People's Bank Of China released its predetermined short-term net outflow of foreign c\urre\ncy assets o,n Sunday and sho$wed as of the end of August this year, its s{h{or{t positions in forward and fut:ures contracts for foreign currencies vs local curr)enc)ies remained zero for 1<2 co!n!s!ecutiv!e months, a,nd ther-e were still no long positio,n i!n t?hat month.
Previous data from the People's Bank O>f China s(howed tha}t as of t)he end of August last ye;a;r, th$e i%t had a total shor,t position o>f $6.044 bi!llion in forward and futures contracts for foreign currencies v"s local currencies, unchanged for the fourth consecutive mon$th; the short position in SDR (Special Drawing Rights) wa's 4.276 billion SDR.
Since then, the foreign exchange forwards s{hor{t position of the People's B>ank Of China rem_ained z^ero.
People's Bank O}f China released the data for the firs[t t@ime at th"e end of March 2016; the data showed t~hat at th`e e*nd of February 2016, its long positions i.n forward and futures contracts for foreign curre@ncie@s vs local currencies was US $2.43^8 billion and sho.rt positions was US $2<8.9 billion.
The data in September rel_eased a&t the end of O@ct@ob@er of the same year showed a net short position i_nc_re_ase of $16.401 billion to $45,.301 billion for th\e first t?ime.
People's Bank O/f China has previously said that the forward and futures sho$rt positions of foreign currencies vs local currencies mainly reflected the forward o(perat(i(on(s of foreign exchange c\arri\ed ou.t by the Pe[opl[e's Bank Of China with c,ommercia,l ba!nks with the purpose of me&eting the hedgin?g needs o_f ente&rprises' foreign c_urrency l;iabi;lit;i;es . It would continue t.o provide forward hedgin]g products according to the principle of actual demand, and the forward operations of the P]eople's Bank Of China would have minor impa{ct on the scale o%f futur]e foreign exchange reserves.
On th}e evening o.f September 2?0 this yea[r, on the K158 train, s@tudent Qiao, who was a ju@nior in Zhengzhou, took the train to Hebi.
An e/l/der uncl|e on the train b.ought a ticket without seat, but he t,oo,k up her seat, and said: "yo=u can t]ake photos, whatever ']'.
During t%he t>w>o h&ou&rs of driving, the train con{ductor advised him f-or an hour, however it still had no results.
I$n the end, a male passenger i=n the same carriage c,ould not stand up and pulled u.p th]e elder uncle.
Fr?o?m the pu.blic opinion, althoug'h the final res!ul!t is mostly t]ha]t the persons who forcibly occupy seats a're condemned by the public, a,dmi,nistrat,i,vel,y p`unished by t[he public security department, and even included in th{e blacklist of integrity, th)e public still feels that it does not "vent thei:r hates": Why can ’ t t_he persons who forcibly occupy seats be pu>nish>ed o<n the spot?
Why can ’ t sto$p immoral or even illegal behavio?r o}n the spot, but can onl(y p"unish it afterwards?
And for the un$reasonable behavior of `?` the elde.r uncle who forcibly occupy seats", w<hy only a mal=e passenger pull him up because o*f "Ro'ad see injustice"?
The main reason is that o:nly long-dis:tance trains are equipped with railway policemen, and the%re is generally no railway p.o.l.icemen for short-distance t%ra%in%s; ev^en i!f t)here i;s railway policemen, the passengers ar<e more concerned about the possible rogue reactions of the persons who forcibly occupy seats and d$o not take compu)l)sory taking away measures.
Repeated seats forcibly oc\cup\ied events have made p.eople realize that it i}s necessary to let the persons who forcibly occupy sea+ts be f=o=rced to take away or even b%e punished on th{e spot.
This req.uir.es that our railway policemen should dar[e to take powerful measures in a ti=mely manner . Tr$ains that d#o not have policemen should mak'e deployment as soon as possible t-o preserve and prev[ent illegal activities in a timely ma%nner.
It is the first day of the National Day holid'ay i'n Oct$ober 1 . There i`s a surge in the vehicles heading f\or Mao County and Songpan Co-un-t-y via Beic(huan Qiang Minority Autonomous County i,n Sichuan.
Beichuan Traffic Police rec;e;ived a call for help at about 13:00 saying t.hat a family member ha}d a traffic accident in So}ngpan and was badly in need o<f being sent to Mi)an)ya)n)g f*or t}rea}tm}ent due to the limited local me-di-cal conditions.
However, the Huanhu Road o;f T"an"gjiash"an quak?e lake in Beichuan was under one-way traffic control, s=o the c)al)l)e)r hoped th$e traffic police would permit the 120 emerge{ncy ambulance to pas%s though the road.
After getting the call for help, the p\olic\ema\n o$n duty quickly report!e!d t}h}i}s to t~he traffic police group . After understanding the general situa<tio<n, the group leader Huang Xuemin imm+e+dia+tel+y ar.ra.nged the policemen o{n duty at the controlled site t'o contact wi:t:h the h:e:lp seeker and asked them to do the escort job well.
"Th{ere were more than 1;000 ve>h>i>cles having entere?d the controlled road segment at that time . After contac*ting w_ith the 120 emergency ambulance, we estimated that it would arrive at Beich_uan at about 15:0(0, so we implem(ented the arrangement an;d deployment immediately. "
The lea=der of Yuli Squadron of Beichuan Traffic Police Da Wei introduced that the emergency ambulance nee!ded t}o bypass the Huanhu Road o{f Tangjiashan quak"e lake, and the road was steep an$d narrow . In order to pr\even\t th,e vehicles in th`e road segment from running side by side, t\he traffic police implemented the subsection control of vehicles in th-e beginning, the middle a[nd the en,d o\f t!he road a+n h!o!ur in advance and reminded all drivers passing thro+ugh it to make a w+ay for the emergency ambulance.
Later, th%e policemen of Leigu Squadron also stopped t=he vehicles entering th%e c;ont;rolled road segment temporarily, and asked the vehicles to form a line t-o make a w=ay fo+r the incoming 12}0 emergency ambulance.

In the crowd, the plainc,l,othes policemen were calmly observing th)e peopl~e passing by.
The investigators, wh%o were wa(iti(ng at th'e bus station, found two suspicious man following a ma!n to ge;t on No . 20 bus f.ro.m Yongding Gate Station at abo/ut 7:00.
On t?he bus, the t"wo men standing on the lef`t and right of the m-a-le passenger, and one of them tried to pro)vide cover for th.e other.
But they didn't know that the plainclothes policem/en st*a*nding by w`e`re paying close attention t.o their every movement.
"Catch the thief with the stolen goods". It was very critical for the plainclothes policemen to choose th|e timing of cat>chi>n>g th%e thief . While waiting for t(he men to steal, the policemen had to keep their eyes on t>hem, wh;o were preparing for the pickpocket . A`s soon as they succe"e"ded i\n p=ickp=ock=et, th:e i%nv%estiga%tors c;aug;ht them a]t one stroke.
The reporter of Beijing Morning P%ost learned that the policemen ferreted o$ut 800 yuan cash fro!m th[e suspected pickpockets.
`^` They took the money from the passenger's co!at p&o&cket&. "
The policeman point\ed to a broken coat pocket and said: "They cut it here, and stole 8,00 y`u`an cash fro!m a Beijing tourist . When we caught the-m, they had ju`st put th<e money into the\ir pocket. `!`
The reporter learned that the pl,ai,nclothes policemen had followed t\h\e suspected pickpockets for a!n hour in o.rder t%o catch them . Finally, the>y caught them at one str<oke when they were com#mitting a crime.
Curr-ently, the tw-o criminal suspects were under the police's e,xaminati,on.
Th=e plainclothes policeman told th+e reporter that it was ea<sy fo$r the policeman to recognize the suspects in the crow*d.
`-` You will f|ind out that t/he thieves' ey+es an$d expr/e/ss/ions were diff/e/re/nt from the ordinary passengers' when you have ca*ught a number of thieves . In addition to staring at other pe"op"le's pockets and backpacks, they also like to g|et into the crowd instead of avoi#din#g the crowd. "
T{h{e policeman also told the reporter that the suspects were often purposeless whi|l|e wai_ti_ng for the bus . They liked to wande\r a[t the bus station a(nd would follow the ta\r\get to g"et on a bus.
"These are the voic*e*s of expe{rie{nce . If you have wo$rked as a pla`inc`l`othes policeman for a long time en?ough, you wi.ll know it quite sensibly. "
Furthermor;e, the policeman also reminded: "I't is the m~o~st convenient to pu%t things in the coat p<o<cke<t, but it will be the easie$st to be stolen. `&`
Mind your o-wn property when you ar$e traveling outside an}d taking a bus to avoid being sto*len.

T|he|r|esa May said that this proposal w|ould ma}ke Northern Ireland carry out different ta&ri&ff regulations, akin to i<t<s secession from Britain.

Report from our corre/spond/e/nt (int\ern reporter, Li Qiyao): I[n recent years, the events o%f unqualified campus plastic runway h<a<ve occurred in many r"egions.
T[h[ere[f[ore, the Ministry of Education i/ssues a not@ic@e that requires the sport fie|lds with surfaces made o\f synthetic materials for primary and secondary schools t?o implement the new n[ational standard before delivery for use afte"r November 1.
The mandatory national standard "The sport fields with surfaces m/ade o^f synthetic materia\ls f%or primary and se!cond!ary schools" is led by the Ministry of Education . 26 research institutes and testing o#rgani#zatio#ns ha)ve participated i!n drafting th~e standard and it have gone through more than two years of revision . Duri=ng that time, more than 10"0 meetings o#f expert a'rgument were held, a%nd t"he nationwide field studies and sampling inspections were implemented . Countless validation experiments ha|ve been collected from p`r`o`ducts of hundreds o,f en!terp!rise!s on the market.
The re'por'ter contrasts th/e old national stand:a:rd in 2005 and finds that the new national sta[n[d[ard has not only change/d from the "natio`na`l recom=men=de=d standard" to th$e "n@at@ional man%da%t%ory standard"', bu,t also added a l;ot of content, including thickness requirements, physical properties, aging resistance, requirements for inorganic filler content, re=quirements for anti-slip colloidal pa+rticle polymer content, limits of harmfu:l substances of surface finished products, l"imits of harmful substances of non-solid an_d solid materials, etc.
In par\ticular, the n:ew national standard limits the harmful substances that may be pr,o,duced in t`h`e construction proce{ss of campus plastic runway, increasing from 7 t!o 1~8 items, and stipulates the limits of volatile organic compounds in the built runway according t:o the st<a<n<da<rd o~f home decor'a't'i'on.
For example, th(e release amount of harmful substances is specified in the "Limits o/f cast-in-situ and prefabricated surface finished products and odor requirements", which requires that the total volatile or+g+ani+c compounds sh`ou`ld n@ot exc`eed 5 mg/cubi)c m^et^er, formaldehyde should not exceed 0.4 m%g%/%cubi%c me!ter, carb-on dis!ulfide should not exceed 7 mg/cubic meter, benzene sh!ould not exceed 0.1 mg/cubic m*ete*r, and the odor grade should not b^e higher than Gr`ade 3.
Th@e new national standard also stipulates in detail the sampling requirements, inspection rules and j%udgment ru$le$s o'f plastic runw?ays of primary an;d secondary schools.
In addition, the campus artificial lawn has also been in`clu`ded in the mandatory testing scope o:f th}e national s_ta_ndard for the first ti*me.
In the near future, spec@ial work plans will be c+ar+ried out for th!e implementation situation o;f the new national standard all over the country, and the implement!ation o+f th'e new national standard sho=uld b|e submitted to the Department o_f Sports Hygiene and Ar*ts Education of the Ministry of Education within the year.

After the timeout, Z>hu Yuling bou'nced back a bit and g*raduall*y tied th_e score at 8-8.
A\t this criti^cal moment, Di:ng Ning had no mercy and got 2 p^oi^nts straightly to reach the ma!tch point.
A)s Zhu Yuling retur[ne[d the ball out of bo^unds, Ding Ning won 4-0 over her rival to t,ake th-e crown.
Last month, D+i+ng Nin%g was crowned the winner of the Bulgaria Open and end_e_d her 1`4-m`on`th tr@op@hy drought . A{lthough sh&e expressed before the game th&at she hadn't se%t any goals fo]r this game in Chengdu, she revealed after the semi-finals in the morning that sh(e had fulfilled her duties.
Final+ly, Ding Ning defeated h+er teammate Z#hu Yuling to win t?he third World Cup c(ha(mp(ion of her own . Sh?e was satisfied with her performan/ce: "The champion is very important to e*very athlete.
I ha>ven't thought of winn"ing th#e champion before th^e game . I just want to try my b%es%t in each game . I'm ve]ry satisfied with my performance i:n the finals. "
As t)he h[o[st, Sichuan girl Zhu Yul^ing won a silver medal, failing to co,m,p,lete the g&oa&l of de*fending . When talking about w[heth[er the enthusiastic home crowd would p+ose invisible pressure on her, she said: "I feel that I ']m doing well in deali+ng with pr#es#sure in the whole g@ame . Ding N]ing is playing very well toda"y, bu.t I haven't found my pace. "
For activating rural consump`t`ion, i{t is necessar;y t^o rely on the normalization mechanism to pur"ify the market, guide the demand for healthy consumption, and enhance the sens\e of g|ain in farmers ’ con=sumption.
According to data, the c`onsu`mption potentiality of rur)al r`es`i`d`ents has bee!n con=tin=uously released . In the first half of this year, the retail sa,les of rural consumer goo:ds increased b]y 10.5%, and the growth r|ate i&s 1.3 percentage points higher than that of towns.
During the visit to a p@o@or village in a western county, t^her^e is only on|e convenience s|tore i<n the wh:ole villag@e . Stepping into the store, some items are the brands we familiar with, h:ow:ever there ar<e lots of fake go(od, such as "金龙`鱼" is labeled as "金龙油" an-d `+` 旺>仔" labeled as "旺奶".
Over the y_e_ars, s(imilar phenomena h`ave been frequently exposed . So^me ru[ra[l fake and inferior products imitate famous brands, they have similar names and packages to mix the false w|ith the genuine, whic>h i|s r+eal+ly hard to prevent.
A con`sume`r survey report released by a ci_ty in the west shows th?at rural shopping malls and supermarkets h:a:ve a serious problem of fake prod@u@cts, and 66% of users have bo?ught fakes i&n supermarkets in v{ill{ages and tow&ns offline, of which foo^d accounts for more tha/n half.
The relevan{t departments claim t/o rectify the rural m*arket*s every year, while, why the phenomena of f#ake products still o!ccu!r repeatedly?
Different from t"he urba"n markets, farmers ’ awareness of rights pro)tec)t)ion is r%elati%vely weak, and ma)ny villages are in remote locations within the blind areas o-f inspection force can ’ t rea&ch, so that the fake and inferior g[oo[ds have a br[eed[in[g g-round.
One product has more than on.e regulatory departments, some are responsible for price, some are for production, a?nd others ar{e for mark+ets, so th$e functions are overlapped . Strong measures a+g+ainst fake and infe%rior products have b%een taken every year, howe=ve=r the cen^t^ral management ca>n only la@st for a period o\f time . On o$ne hand, the fakes e,s,cape the crack down trend and s;lowly emerged, on the other hand, the previous fakes just have bee@n d"e"alt and the new fa)ke came out.
So-me unscrupulous traders have i*nitiat*ed the idea of "going to t[he mountainous areas and th}e countryside" and some rural area&s become the `}` wast.e elimination markets", bot:h of these problems are because of long-term supervision mechanism, dif[fi[culties in pu:rifyin:g ru|ral markets, low illegal cost and higher profit.
From food and clothing to w`ell-off, the majority of farmers a.re moving towards development ty,pe consump@tion.
A few da'ys ago, the Party Central Committee and the St<ate Council issued the "Some Opinions concerning Stimulating the C@onsumpti@o@n Mechanism to Further Encourage the Consumption Potential of Residents", which proposed t|o promote th:e leve|l upgrading o,f the co:nsumption of rur(al r}es}id}ents . The pur|pos|e is to make the majority of farmers to `.` have ability t\o consume", "have willing t.o consume" an#d "dare to co[n[s[u[me" to l+et the rural consumption really flourish.
On the one han-d, we must deepen reforms, eliminate d/ra/wbacks of market management policies coming from multiple d]epa]r]tment]s an%d regul-ate by more tha?n one dep#artments . According to local conditions, improve t\he food safety, p&ro&d&u&ct quality supervision network, a>nd co_n_stant_ly reduce the space for rural fake products manufacturing a"nd selling.
On the other han]d, i.t is necessary to intensify law enforce&men&t and open up the su)p)ervi)sion of each department, and never all"ow th,e fake and inferior c<omm<odi<ties to breed in the countryside.
It i=s the protection for farmers to severely punish the behavior of ent>r>a>pp>ing farmers . N(o matter how concealed the counterfeiters hi%de, it should not be the reaso*n for th;e breeding o-f the fake a~nd inferior commodities . Rel%eva%nt departments should clarify t\heir responsibilities, and the grassroots supe<rvisory powers shou_ld g`o down . If there is a pro+ble+m in any part, it is nece/ssary to investigate th@e responsibility and let th=e counterfeiters and selling persons have nowhere to hide.
Strictly co|nt|r|o|l the market acce[ss, implement strict qualification examinations for production operators . Keep the mar;ket circulation, le>t the products have clear sou)r)ces and ou"tlet markets . Think o;f ways from the source an[d the roots, let th<e legal dealers operate with peace o`f mind, a)nd let t=he farmers buy with confidence.
Act.iva.te rur[a[l consumption, guide the demand fo%r healthy consumption.
As consumption upgrading, ma$ny farmers no#t only pursue of well fed and eat well, but als`o g^o after for high qualit_y life w:it:h cult`ur`e and healthy . Thus, r~ural markets are not equ_al to "low quality" and `|` low price".
This nee<ds t>o pr(o(mot(e the extensi!on o<f e-commerce to the vast rural area-s, connect the urban and rural two-way linkage sales channels, promote t(he combination of offl)i)n)e industry development platform and on,l,i,ne e)-commerce trading p-l-a-tfor-m, support th+e new forms and new modes of consumption to ex$pand into the rura,l market; promote qualified villages and towns t/o combine trade logistics with leisure agriculture, rural tourism, and product processing dynamically; improve the rural modern cir[culat[i[on n_etwork sys>tem, optimize the integration of s;t;ock facilities resources, and effectively reduce rural circulation c:osts.
Create a clear a#n#d reass?uring market e/n/vi/ron/m/ent for the rural areas, s~o that farmers can afford to buy, so tha]t th!e rural consumption can become m/ore and more prosperous a,n,d the farme(rs ’ senses of gain and happiness can be enhanced.
Our c?ountry will reduce t+he MFN tariff rate for some goods fro^m Nov%em%be%r 1, and the general t[ariff level will b?e reduced to 7.5%.
According t|o the decision of the 26th executive m;e;eting of the State Council, the Tar[iff Commission of the State Counci?l announced o.n September 3|0 that the MFN tariff rate for some goods would b\e reduce%d from November 1, 2<0<18.
According to the "Tariff C@ommi@ssion of the State Council's Announcement on Reducing t"he Import Tariff for S]ome Goods '`', the MFN tariff rate f*o*r some good*s, including the industrial good\s, would b+e reduced from November 1, 2018 in ord]er to adapt to the indu;s;t;rial up&gradi&ng, reduce th[e en\t\e\rp\ris\e costs, and satisfy people's demands o[f multilevel consumption.
There we?re 1585 taxable items in total fo?r t]he tax reduction go{o{ds, whi[ch accou}nt}ed for about 19% of total taxable ite?ms in our country . The av'erage tax rate was re?duce?d from 10.5% to 7.8% by an average of 2(6%.
This tax reduction main_ly involved t&he textiles; s"tone"s, ce|ra|m|i|cs, glas)s products; some s=te=e=l and base m~etal p_roducts; electromechanical devices an:d parts, such as metal processing machinery, textile mac}hi}nery, engineering machinery, elec-tric transmission and transformation equipment, ele}ct}rica}l appliances, i>nst>rumen>ts an^d apparatus, etc .; resource goods and primary processed go[o[ds, such as non-metal ores, inorganic chemicals, wood and pa,pe,r products, gemstone and jade, et~c.
Meanwhile, with the reduction of general tariff leve?l, especially t/he impo$rt tariff reduction of medicine and consum^er goods, the taxable items and tax rate for impor)t t\a\x on imported g/oods would be re(d(uced accordingly.
In order to implement the decis*ion*s and deployments of the Party Central Committee and t|he State Co'uncil, our country ha=d impl'emented the zero tariff on most imported dru\gs since May 1 this ye`ar, h.ad reduced the import tariff for automobiles and parts and some consumer goods since Ju%ly 1, and h.ad implemented the third ste}p of t<a<x reduc*tion fo"r products in the extended scope of Information Technology Agreemen.t.
The reporter learned from the Tariff Commission of the State Council that the g$eneral ta=rif=f level in ou\r country wa:s reduced from 9$.8% o<f the p#reviou#s y=e=ar to 7.5%, by an average of 23% after several continuous independent adju+stments.
Pr<oper tariff reduction would be beneficia(l t,o accelerating the balan#ce#d development of foreign trade, promoting the higher-level opening to t<h<e outside world, overall planning and usi'n'g the international an/d domestic r>eso>ur>ces, an\d boosting the domestic supply-side structural reform.
The relevant responsible person of t@h@e Commission said that this year was the 40th anniversary o"f the reform and open)ing)-)up . Taking the initiative to reduce the general tariff leve-l was the practica|l action of implementing t'he spirit o{f Gen<e<ral Secretary X]i Jinping '-s important speech at the Boa'o Forum for Asia, and our country's important measure of fu`rther opening up and actively expanding imports based on o^ur demand f]or h{igh-{qual{ity development . These action and meas_ure showed that China would unswervingly pursue the mutually benefic+ia+l openin&g&-up strategy, strengthen th`e mo-t-i-v-e of self-developm=en=t, and deliver benefits to the wo)rld through its development.

A[s t|h|e level of urbanization in Chi/na continues to increase, the urban population has increased rapidly, and a large number of rur^a^l young people have le@ft their ho=metow=n=s to start urban li%fe.
Y^ang Qiaojia, an expert on agricultural brand research in China, said: "Currently, urban lif#e is fast-paced and stressful . M(ore and mo're peopl'e are beginning to miss their rural l]if]e when they were young . Howev"e"r, ‘ the place that ca.n not g{o ba@c@k is th}e hometown, and the most beaut+iful memory i$s from the country ’, the brand design of ‘ Huanxiangren ’ i$s named aft"er the provincialism and h;omes;ickness o$f the wa)nd)ering people of Huanhuan County.

Th#e gross domestic product (GDP) of Canada grew b[y 0.2% in July compared with the previous month, wit@h a higher-than-expected g"rowin"g rate, rais}ing market expectations th{at the Bank o|f Canada wi]ll raise interest ra#tes next month.
I'f it does, i]t will be the fifth time in a b=it more t_han a year that the b=ank raises interest rates.
The analysts of Reuters who made an intervie%w previously f.o.recasted a 0./1% increase.
Th*e Statistics Canada said on Friday that 12 of t)h)e 20 industries ha=d ach;ieve;d growth.
The data is noteworthy for the re<a<s<on that the Bank of Ca`n`a`da predicted earlier thi-s month that temporary factors could dr]ag down th?e third-q?u?arter GDP data.
Poloz, t[he president o`f the B-ank of Canada, promised on Thursday that the bank w@ould continue to gradually rai\se interest rat"es and pay close atten"tion to the economic data.
The Bank of Canada will announce it_s next interest rate decis/ion o,n October 24.
Th`e B"ank of Canada has raised interest rates four times since July 201<7 as th<e Canadian e.con.omy has stre>ngthen>ed and the unemployment rate is close to record lows.
Stephen Brown, the senior Canad"ian econo|mi|st a`t Capital Econ>om>ics, said that the country's third-quarter GD#P was expec;te;d to grow at an annualized r`a`t`e of around 2%.
"This will be 1.5% higher than the expectation of th<e Bank of Canada, which will be ano'ther reason to e.xpe.c.t the Bank of Can*ada to ra:ise inte!rest rate~s next month," he sai&d in a rep=ort.
Overnight index swaps sh\ow that the market f=orecasts for prob;abil;it;y of risin~gs of interest rate of the Bank of Canada i/n October rise from 76.46% to 78+.2+7%.
North Korea and South Korea jointly insp/ected the entrance of Han River fo$r the first time o?ver th%e p}ast 65 years
O(n Day 5, th=e South Korea Defense Mini@s@t@r@y confirmed t]ha]t on the same day, Nort'h Kor]ea and South Korea launched joint inspection i.n the water area of the entrance o:f Han River and Imjin River.
This action i:s ear<ly<-stage pr:epar:at:ions to ensure the free navigation of civilian vessels f'o'r both sides.
The notification provided b[y the So+u+th Korea Defense Mini\stry to the media on the same day showed t]hat this was the fir.st joint inspection of the entrance o+f Han R&iver for both sides since the signing of the Korea?n War Arm@istice Agreement in 1953.
N}orth Kore/a a~nd Sou?t?h Korea si}gned a military agreement in September, an}d agreed to jointly i|nsp|e|ct the entrance of Han R-i-ver and other water areas from November, in order to ensure the environmental protection, tourism development and other aspe;c;ts in such water areas i#n the future.
In October, North Korea and S;outh Kore{a planned a joint inspection o=f the wat=er areas during a general-level me:e:ting.
On Novembe&r 5, the joint inspection of the water areas o\f Nort<h Ko=rea and South Korea was officially laun&ched.
The joi>nt insp|ect|ion d.elegation consisted of 2=0 military personnel and experts from North Korea and South Korea.
According to the introduction of t@he Sou|th Korea De/fe/nse Ministry, during this inspection, pers]onnel from bot$h sides didn ’ t carry arms and were forbidden to us[e the word(s and deeds that c^o^ul^d irritate the other side.
"Since there is no military de#mar#catio#n li/ne nea]r the entrance, t$his area was on?ce an acciden't'-prone region . But through joint inspection, it will become a new peaceful a!re!a in the future. `]`
The total length of the wa]te]r areas which were j/oint/ly inspected by North Korea a`nd South Korea w@as ab%o%ut 70 km and the total area was about 2#8#0 square kil]omete]rs.
The South Korea Defense Min.ist.ry s#ai#d that South Korea would send s$i$x inspection vessels to explore the depth of the se!a water t^o provide basic i+nformat+io+n for the safe navigation in such water areas; after the investigation was comp$l$e$ted, navigatio-n m/aps would be provided for civilian ve=ssel=s.
In October 2007, North Kore{a and South Ko*rea held a su}mmit talk i?n Pyongyang and reached an agreement o~n the jo-int use of t;h;e entrance of Han R-iver and I]m]jin River, while subsequent negotiations deadlocked due to tensions on the Korean Peninsula.
According to the military agreement signed by South Kor+ea and North Korea in September, vessels of both sides only ne?ed to inform th<e other side in advance bef'or'e s_ailing in c{o{m{mon wat\ers in the futu^re.
R'e'port o'n November 5 of Ch*in*a News: the website of the Chinese embassy in Mongolia reported on November 5 that C^hines^e citizens Guo Yu/qin and Mao Runxin had been missi@ng when t~ravel~i~ng i|n Mongolia,.
I:t w,as understood th#at these two people were members of t/he Blue S^ky Rescue team . On October 19, they contacted their relatives and friends in China a_nd said they would immediately explore the m!ountains near the Khovsgo:l La/ke . They shared t(heir location v,i,a WeChat and t'hen went missing . It was sus`p`ected that they had headed for t-he no man's land.
Th/e Chinese embassy i>n Mongolia always p-aid high attention to the pro:tect:ion of the lawful rights an@d interests and safety of Chinese c(i(tizens in Mongolia, as we[ll as the consular protection and assistance.
After being in<forme<d of the inform[ati[o[n a]bout th=e tw+o tourists going missing, the embassy immediately activated the contingen|cy plan f)or consular protection, strived to seize the prime time for res^cue and spared no efforts to work.
Th&e embassy maintained close communication wit#h the two tourists' f|a|mi|lies, assisted th`em in immediately reporting the case t]o the Mongolian police, and provided them w%ith a l%ist of interpreters for the?ir choice.
The embassy made an a/ppoi/nt/ment with the heads of t~h~e Mongolian Foreign Re'lations Department, the General Bureau o(f Police and the General Bureau o|f Emergency a_t fir]st t(ime to report relevant information . The embassy requested the Mongolia#n side to carry out the sear]ch a:nd rescue o?peration as soon as possible and maintain@ed close communication with the Mongolian side during the se!arch and r%esc%ue process to ensure to keep up the latest progress.
Meanwhile, the embassy ass]isted th@e family membe[rs i(n pu%blishi%ng th!e n}otic}e fo<r missing persons in Mongolia, and extensively mobilized overseas Chinese and Chinese-funded enterprises in Mongolia to actively participate in searching the missing person*s, provide effective clues . The embassy also provided r<el<ev<an<t assistance to the membe:rs of the B`lue Sky Rescue team who went to Mongol<i<a for assistance.
Unde`r the stron%g boost of the embassy, the Mongolian side immediately se{nt a res<cu<e team and promised to exempt t(he sea)rch and rescue costs.
The General Bureau of Police and the General Bure\au of Emergency of Mongolia instructed the pol>ice and emergendy department o)f Hovsgol province to spare n@o effor{ts t"o s%ear%c%h and rescue the missing persons.
Since Khovsgol Lake was located at the border o)f north o{f Mongolia and Russia, its loca%tio%n was in r{e{m{o{te, and it was a vast territory with a sparse population of which tran>sportation and communication was extremely inconvenient . Meanwhile, Mongolia h`as currently entered the w>in>t>er, a'nd the t~emperatu~r~e wa>s as low as around -20 d*egree*s . The local police and emergency department overcame great difficulties, almos/t to m&obilize all fo#r#ces and stimulate the local her/d/smen to ca;rry out t(he carpet search a~n~d rescue operation a:ro:un:d the wide range o:f the position where two people lost for days on end through the w?ays o.f horse riding, walking, and visiting th`e he%rdsm%en.
Meanwhile, in view of special c'o'nd'itions i*n the p"as"toral are!as, the Mongolia side has b|ee|n circularly publishing the notice of m{i{ss{ing persons through the radio for days.
Relevant sta"ff o!f Chinese Blue Sky Rescue team have also c*ome t'o Mongolia t;o actively participate in the rescue work together with the Mongolian s,ide.
T(he safety of the two missing pe!rsons has always affect%ed our hearts.
To date, t)he t?wo people have been l+ost for more than 10 days . Th~e embassy successively received some cl\ue\s, but s-till cannot find them . The search and rescue operation wa`s still u-nder way.
The embassy would al$ways foll"ow the principle of "people first", sustain attention to this matter, push the Mon(golian side t*o continue the all-out sear[ch an'd rescue operati?on and p-ro-v-ide maximum assistance to the two persons' fami\li\es.
The embassy appeals t!o th\e compatriots and enterprises in Mongolia to contact th$e Chinese emb?assy in Mongolia at firs/t time for any relevant clues.
