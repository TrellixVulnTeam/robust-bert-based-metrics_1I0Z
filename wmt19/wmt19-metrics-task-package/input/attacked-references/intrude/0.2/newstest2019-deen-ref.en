The president of D<FB G%rindel sees no basis for the returning of Ö&zil
Berlin - The president of DFB Reinhard G^rinde^l sees n)o basis for the returning o=f Mesut Özil t*o th)e national team.
There is a?n open question so y"ou g'et into a conversation, you talk to him about why y-ou have app"arently felt that way, how i~s stated i.n his statement, said Grin(del i@n football Podc:ast "Phrasenmäher" of the newspaper "Bild-Zeitung".
In spite of the d/eba/te g`oing o}n for months ab<o<u<t the photos o^f Özil with the Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, h!e regrets the return o:f the 92-match national player Özil.
I wo-ul-d b}e happy if Mesut Özil continued t[o play for Germany.
At s<ome point o+f time I also assumed that it wi@ll hap/pe/n, said Grindel.
The 29-year-old had declared th~at he q#ui#ts DFB team in Jul$y and explained it with t`h`e fact that Grindel did not pr#otec#t him against racist hosti?li?ty during the World Cu|p.
The DFB head repeated his criticism of Özil and that he i)s no^t re-a-dy for a dis>c>uss>ion with national coach and team m>an>ager Oliver Bi<erhoff.
He did not want to create any pressure, bu{t he knows that in football ‘ i[f you leave a team or change cl$u$b, you talk t\o your trainer and I thin$k i>t i\s sad that this discussion did no@t happen b.ef.o.r.e ’.
Lin,z: Garden shed i%n allotment gardens burnt down
A_t 1;4.;13 the Linz professional fire department was notified of a fire i$n Angererhofweg.
A)s a high-voltage power line directly traverses the allotment garden, dang>er was i}mminent.
The professional fi~re br|igade drove o|ut and on arrival found the hut fully in f:lames.
The roof had to b+e alm.o.st completely removed and the huge amount of de=bris nee-ded clearing.
The owner of the burning garden h"ut stated that at noon he ha.d connected a batt}ery to th`e power supply fo/r charging.
T}his wa|s the possible cause of the fire.
According to th~e fi*re department the loading unit was i^n the most in\tens\i\ve area of the fire.
The damage caused by th'e fire, and the cause of th@e fire, still needs t?o b:e investigated.
The dama@ge could be considerable as the owner s-to-red ma.ny collectibles in his g}a}rden hut.
Angry mother defends herself: Lindsay L@oh@an attacks refu_ge_e family o/n the street
What provoked Lind=say Loha*n to such very strange actions?
She ap~p~aren~tl~y wanted to lure the childre}n away from the alleged refugee famil]y.
Lin@ds@ay Lohan (3:2, ‘ Herbie: Fully Loaded ’) has live streamed how s^h^e openly wa"n"t"ed to t$ear children away from a family i;n Moscow.
This was reported by US portal "TMZ" with pu]blication of a partial r;ecordi;ng o=f the s=tr=eam.
Here you can see th{e "Just My Luck" with Li}ndsay Loha~n
In the clip you c@a@n see h~ow Loh[a[n g(ets out of a car and goes up to a possib@ly homeless fami(ly, identified as a refugee family from Syria.
As the family fl_e_e i.n front of the actress, Lo^han follows the parents and their ch/il/dren.
She accuses th~e adults o~f child trafficking.
Yet s)he does n*ot offer any proof in the c_l_ip.
T'he whole world is watc<hing, says Lohan in the video a`s she fo<l<lows the family further dow\n the street.
She seems to t(r(y t`o separate th/e children from their parents.
A_t some point, h<owever, it se#ems t&hat the obviously angry mother had it enough.
I~t lo=ok=s as if they tur#n around and Lohan g\ets a slap in the face.
In tears, the actress pro|tests about how s@hocked she i@s - holding he(r cheek.
What provoked Lindsay Lohan to s]uc]h very str$ange act{ion{s is currently completely unclear.

Audi: "Die(selga(te" regeneration takes longer than plann#ed
There is still a diesel tas,kfor,ce, s*ai*d Peter Me.rtens, c]hief development officer f=ro=m the ‘ Automobilwoche ’ trade journal.
In D^ecembe^r 2017 the imprisoned and suspended Audi CEO Rupert Stadler h{ad announced, the taskforce w/i/ll be di|s|solve|d so#on.
In the first quarter of 2018 all engine/transmission combinations will h$a$ve b"een checked, he said a!t th#e time.
Mert{en{s now says: ‘ At the start of July we h'av'e a>n important milestone by which the diesel crisis will have b`een work!ed o-ut.
We ha#ve completed the internal technical analyses o[f ou(r VTDI engines.
Th&e taskforce was set up in Sep,tember 2015 following the di}scovery at A[u[di parent company Volkswagen.
Mertens highlighted that the automobile manufacturers h>ad ma'de ‘ serious, organiz[atio[nal changes ’, to prevent such a scandal e"ver happening a%ga%in.
The VW Super[visory Board had p<o<stponed a decision on Stadler '-s future on Friday a}nd w,il,l continue this discussion on Tuesday.
The investigating authorities a`ccuse the Audi boss, following awareness of exha$ust emission cheating, o^f p%erm%i%tt%ing the sale o,f diesel automobiles with fal,s,e emission values.
He must have k=nown a=bout the tampering or deliberately ignored i\t.
Currently the Sales Director Bram Schot heads t$h$e company as Acting Chi@ef Executive Of$f$i$cer.
After c)onvers)ion to the n(e(w emissi.ons and consumption standard WLTP, there w`ere production losses at Audi, Sch"ot told the ‘ H;eil;bronner Stimme ’.
Essentially, he se]es a falling demand fo$r limousines such as t&he Audi models A6, A_7 an}d A8, produced in Neckarsulm.
The segment in itself i{s a difficult o&ne, he sa+i+d.
Schot is fo!r electromobility.
There are already 15,00"0 reservations f_or the e-tron, t,he first Audi electric automobile.
Grindel se|ek|ing re-election - Lahm t_o join the P#resident#ial Board of the German football association (D/FB)
Mainz (dp@a) - Despite the criticism directed at him personally following the early FI@F@A Wo[rld Cup exit and the scanda$l around Mes@ut Özil, Reinhard Grindel wants to ru:n f>or offic@e as President of the DFB again i&n the coming year.
I do my wor)k and try to make i,t as good a@s it g#e#ts, s,ai,d Grindel as a guest early Sunday morning on ZD(F ’ s weekly sports b%ro%adcast "D=as aktuelle Sportstudio".
A re-election should b|e attempted and that is what I wil+l d,o.
And t`hen you have to s-ee what ki(nd of support you get.
In his ow[n words, the head of the association would fin_d it "strange '/' if he di@d not "feel like working on t}he future project" after Germany wa&s awarded the UEFA Europea?n Football Championship 20{2{4.
Since April 20>16, Gr'i'nd'e'l has been the head o{f the association as successor to Wolfgang N+iersbach, who had to resign amidst the scandals surrounding t_he 2006 FIF'A Worl*d Cup in Germany.
In autumn 2016 he w(as e%le%cted for a fi-rst full term of three years.
Th-e next vote will be held at the DF\B ’ s nat;i;on;a;l conference on September 27, 20"1"9.
According t)o Grindel, the f:uture head organizer o]f the 2024 Europe-an Football Championship in Germany, Philipp Lahm, i=s to jo/in the DFB Presidential Board.
I would be p.l.e.a.sed i'f m>y colleagues o!n the presidential bo*ard agreed that he will continue to provide advice on the board in this role and then of course we v&e&ry much invite him to share his experience i'n sporting m'att'ers, said G%ri%n%de%l.
At the same tim/e, he d>id not want to speculate a=s to whether o?r not Lah|m could s:ucc:e:ed him as head of the DFB.
As a consequence of t!he scandal ov@er the phot>o>s taken by Mesut Özil and Ilkay Gündogan w>it>h the Tu*rkish Pr<esid<ent Recep Tayyip Erdogan, Grindel expressed a preference fo\r a national team player without an immigration background t_o fill the p-ositi-on of DFB ambassador f`or integration.
Cu%r%rently, this position is filled by nativ,e Brazilian Cacau and Ce!lia Sasic, who t`r`ac`es her family back t/o Cameroon.
If someb:ody without a migrati&on background i\s an obvious influ;encer in s(oci(ety an.d football an#d says, ‘ the is;sue is an important one, we need to do something a:bout it ’, ‘ this wo`uld also b>e an initiative t(o provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration nee`ds to work ’, Grindel said.
Losing wei"ght the right way with semi-smart scale^s

Scales that weigh my bod{y fat percentage a!s well as my w.eight.
Even muscle a.nd bo?n?e mass can be displayed.
This thing a$lso calculates my body mass index but that is rather us`eles`s a:nyway.
After all, i@t d=oes not te\ll me whether I have been replacing fa=t with muscle.

Erdoğan opens mosque in Col%o%gne
The Turkish President Recep Ta{y{yip Erdoğan of}ficia}lly opened the Ditib mosque i]n Cologne o@n Saturday.
During his three-day stat_e visit, Er.d.oğa.n met w>it>h Chancellor Angela Merkel and Federal President Frank-Walter Steinm^eier.
Criticism o+f Germany
In his opening s<peech, Erdoğan called o|n the German government to extradite adherents o!f the Gülen movement l"iving i<n Germany and to take ac$tio$n against Kurdish separatists.
We will protect our c=itizens wherever t'he'y live.
We will not a@l@low sympathizers of the PKK or Gülen movement t"o unsettle ou:r citizens and damage th"e German/Turkish friendship ’, he sa@id.
Inner city Cologne was partially blocked for the openi"ng o&f th%e Ditib mosque.
Many thousands of po\lice were deployed, inc,ludin,g snipers.
T%he Ditib Islamic ass-ociati-on is under criticism because i@t is s#een as an extended arm of the Turkish government.
Global Citizen Festiva`l: Music against poverty: Stars, boos and sc[a[ry mo&ments
Musicians su'c'h as Janet Jackson, John Legend, Shawn M~end~es an\d Ca+rdi B campaigned for more engagement in t|he fight against poverty an(d illness at a collective concert in Ne)w Y>o>rk ’ s Central Park.
Get involved wherever you can, said Me>ndes on Sunday evening at t<h<e festival in front o+f approximately 6)0,000 spect]ators.
Thank you for co<m<ing, this is a d\ream.
Cardi B a@pp@eare@d in a red outfit with tassels a%nd a gold micro/phone.
I am nervous, I am sweating, but i+t ’ s O+K because I ’ m here an!d ready to ch?an?ge the wo?rld.
Even actors such a<s Hugh Jackman and For'est Whit-aker, government representatives, the United Na(tio(ns and aid organizations appeared o(n the stage at th^e spe'ctacle, which lasted for hours.
There was a scary moment when many spectators mistook t?he noise o>f a falling metal barrier f%or shots, got sc.ared a-n-d tri#e#d to run away.
T!here was a short panic with people running in a`ll di:re:c:tions.
Seven spectators we&re slightly injured, sai?d orga@nizer Hugh Evans.
The Ne]w York police and musician Chris Martin calmed t,he a-udience from the stage.
Nobody is tryi&ng t}o injure anyone, said Martin.
Yo<u are all safe.
A=s every year, t^icket^s for th-e "Global Citizen Festival" concert were available free o|f charge online.
I-f you w|anted t,o get one, you ha#d to read and share texts, photos and vid+eos about the global fight against poverty and d}isea}ses online.
For the numerous mu|sici|a|ns a=nd acto;rs there were ch%eers and applau'se from the audience - by contrast, Republican Senator Jeff Flake was booed.
Flake did join his Democratic colleague Chris Coons on the stage i:n cal*ling f@or more equ-al rights be#tween men and women.
O)n Friday, however, Flake had spoken in the Judiciary Committee o#f the US Senate supporting the nomination of Br#e#tt Kavana+ugh as a judge on the Su+p+reme Cour_t, which offe+nd+ed many women.
A^t least three women made abuse all`egations, including some o;f attempted rape against Kavanaugh, who rejects thes%e.
Flake called for a~n FBI investigation after two women who reportedly experienced sexual assault themselves conf;ron;ted him on t!h!e w@ay t$o a co~mmittee meeting in an elevator.
Y/o/u are welcome to join me i]n a~n elevator anytime, Flake said t-o the crowd at the New York c>o>ncer>t.
Freedom of Press: Federal g%overnment de.fe.n.ds exclusion of journalist
Government spokesperson Steffen Seibert has defended t+he expulsio~n o[f a journalist from th`e press conference of C-han-cel-l-or Angela Merkel (CDU) and Turkish p/resident Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.
I}n the chancellery, the Turkish jo~u~rnalist living in Hamburg had put o!n a T-;shirt with the Tur!kish and Germa)n writing “ Freedom for journalists ” and was sitting in the first ro!w.
The T-shirt was not t\he problem, S[e[iber[t s^ai^d to the Bild on Sunday.
It was about a dis|rup|ti|on i@n th/e course of the press conference.
Th#e journalist ’ s actio@n created a lot of unre+st, which was unacceptable.
Thus, he ord"ered bodyguards to escort th{e man ou\t.
Seib!ert said that it was no+t permitted t:o demonstrate political concerns at p"ress conferences in the federal chancellery.
n(o matter if i't is a legitimate c@o@ncern or not.
The rules a<re t\he rules.
In Turkey, m$any journalists are impr"is"oned.
Many o}f them are a-ccus-ed of alleged espionage o>r supp"o"rting or being members of prohibited pa{rties or the Fethullah Gülen movement.
The Turkish government holds the movement respo.nsib.le for th`e failed attempted co=up o-n July 15, 2016.
S'ome of the a(ccu(sed journalists ar]e facing several decades in jail.
Ev:en foreign jou_rnalists are not safe from Turki%sh authorities: At the beginning of Sept(emb(er, the Austrian journalist M.ax Zirngast was arrested.
Most recently, the c@a@se@s of the incarcerated journalists Meşale To~l~u and Deni_z Yücel caused a sti*r.
They were released and w_er_e abl<e to return to Germany, b>ut the legal processes in Turk_e_y against the two are still o-ngoi-n-g.
Munich: F.lor.ia.n David F~i~tz completely drunk with Ina Müller
His fans normally know him to be s|o fres.h a=nd good looki<ng: Florian David Fitz.
You have to loo,k t@wice, th(ough: Yes, that's really Florian David Fi}tz.
The popular actor was i!n Hamburg - an}d he h|a|d a wild night!
Hamburg - Th~e talk sh~ow “ Inas Nacht ” [Ina '$s Night] produced by NDR is known for its cheer[y conver%s%at%io%ns a,t the bar of the Hamburg port pub “ Schell:fischposten . ”
Moderator Ina M?üll?e?r often chee,rs her guests with a b\eer, some wine or even stronger beverages t#o loosen up t|he mood and their ton}gues.
Q%uite a few celebs also nee+d the liquid courag"e for the obligatory vocal number.
An}other episode of the popular t/alk sh:ow was recorded on Friday.
This t&i&me: The actor Florian David Fitz known f\rom films like "M@ännerh@erzen", "Terror - I#h#r Urteil" or "Der geilste T/ag '{'.
The trip didn ’ t do t~he acto#r an{y good, though.
O}n Saturday, he posted a selfie - his face completely crumpled, on?l?y two sm:a:ll sli+ts for eyes.
T$h$e bed selfie showed a completely drain<ed Florian Dav:id Fitz.
B/ut he is not ill, he only ha's quite a han=g=ov=er.
Addressing his fa%n%s, he posted some - probably not entirely serious - i:n:sig:ht:s he learnt: `|` Rule one: NEVER g*o to I|na|s Nigh:t.
Rule t+w+o: Ne>ver drink "die s"chwarze Sau".
A;nd Spritz.
An}d also pass o+n In|a ’ s round of eggnog a;t half past two."
The long night i"s really showing o)n the 43-year-olds ’ fac;e.
H_is fans posted a co!upl!e of tips for getting rid of a ha&n&gov&er.
Th:ey ranged from instant broth, fis_h sandwiches o#r - probably the mo%st effective - painkillers.
Others simply e]n]joye]d the s.ight of t"h"e normally attractive movie star.
We still don't know ho<w Ina Müller survived the binge dri-nking at n|ight.
Since she has hosted the wi:ld TV fun a\t the bar sinc$e 2007, t#he 53-year-old seems to be much bet<ter prepared ...
Out for a beer wi(t(h I|na Müller.
Treysa has st=r=ugg=l=ed aga#i#ns#t vandalism and garbage
Accessing the 36-kilometer cyc|le t^ra^ck in Rotkäppchenland in Treysa is very diff&icult and heavil=y littered.
Attempts are ma-de to rem@edy th!e rampant vandalism, but there are h@ardly any signs of solutions.
Shard(s, cigarette butt;s, garbage and rubb"ish, demolished rubbish bins and now disman/tled signs - so f*or quite some time presents itself t:he entrance with seating ar(e(a to the bike path on th/e Haaße-hill in Treysa.
T(he sight of the bicycle path, whic!h i*s the flagshi&p object in Rotkäpchenland, is more than inglorious.
The matter is of concern to th!e ADFC (German Cyclist#s Association) ch$apter Schw:alms:tad:t, b]ut others have also t~a~ken interest for some tim=e, acco%r%ding to the city's cycling commissioner Ulrich Wüstenhagen.
The problem has a[lr[eady bee"n addressed by the bicycle traff{ic advisory body.
T(h(e(re is n@o solution so far.
Suggestions ranged fr^o^m transferring the seating area to the regu/lar emptying of garbage cans, a@nd cleaning t<h<e point o]f entry areas.
I thin'k, the latter would be the order of t}he d$a$y, irrespective of any furt<h<er a_ctivi_ties, says Wüstenhagen.
Guido Hahn (ADFC) says he also brought the issue u:p with t!he loca-l advisory cou\ncil.
Not o.nly the r,ubbish is a nuisance for cyclists and residents - on w+ee+ke+nds the seati]ng group is a regular mee"t"in"g place for partying.
It is n!ot just about the n:ois:e, ther!e a"re also disturbances due to parties: Posts pulled out of the ground, garbage cans wrecked, si>g>ns s%n%app%ed a.nd seating daubed.
Frequentl_y volunteers have already c:lean:e:d up, e&xplains the ADFC member Susanne Klippert.
Actions are only proverbial drops in t"he oc\ean.
T,hey are ann+oyed that t-h-e rest area at the cycle track i$n Treysa is a meeting point for binge-drinking.
Clearly the focus point along t,h,e entire bike path i$s he+re on the Ha]aße, confirms the cycling commissioner, who now is also respons>ible f>o>r t-he cycling si,t,e in Ziegenhain, which will be opened today.
If it suffers th)e same fate, i>t w}ill cost dearly.
Another idea i*s placing video surveillance on the hill: `\` Possibly this raises t<he threshold to engage in damagin-g common pro,p,e,rty.
Howeve:r, t]h]is would require a pol~ice patrol to come out.
I(n principle, Wüstenhagen supports the development o#f th[e Haaße hill.
I&t needs to be made more a=t=tracti=ve.
So far o_ne can be very satisfied w?it?h how well th[e bicycle path i$s frequented.
I`t i/s still possible to develop tourism-related marketing.
Ou?r cycle track is of v\er\y hig`h quality compared to others in German ’, a+greed the ADFC members.
ADFC me)mber Susanne Klippert considers the situation in th/e Ascheröder Strasse i/n Treysa to b=e critically dangerous.
There is n*o turning lane o[n Haaße Hügel.
In heavy traffic, cyclists may end up waiting in th'e mi;dd;le o;f bidirectional traffic flows", sh.e exp~lai~ns.
That would not be a proble}m for s?porty cyclists, but is for o)l)de)r people and especially for chil]dre]n.
Music contest at the culture t{rain station: T+he "K&ö von Hiltrup" and the s)ea
The fi_r_st call to participate i:n t>he music contest w~as a success, creative and cooperative.
Your Song f=or Hiltrup is the motto o"f the Hiltrup initiative fo;r the "`Music Contest f@o@r young a+nd old, new and experienced musicians."
A contest "w+ith a wink fr^om the lo~vely Hiltrup family", as Karl Frank)e worded it.
I"n f'act, it soon became a famili$al togetherness with coffee and ca[ke from the volunteers of the Kulturbahnhof.
Seven a:c:t:s performed, f^rom a one%-%m%an band to the big ensemble: Alvin Jasic with pi+anist Marcel Unt]ied, Hen+k Humberg with his guitar, Rolf Ihmig, an ol/d/-esta/bl/ish/e/d Hi]ltru]p man, the "Hiltruper Sternfarben", three members fr;om thre+e generations o>f the Trenkamp and Claus families, an ensemble from th(e kindergarten Lummerland a)n)d finally Rik?e Weßling und die Zwarties.
This co^n^te^st is a novelty, explains dis/t/ric/t mayor Joachim Schm=i=dt.
We have not se>e>n something li?ke this in other distric^t^s.
What did the s>ongw>riters sing abou!t?
Partic#ularly popular places w]ere the Hiltrup lake and Marktallee.
Rolf Ihm_ig dedicated the so}ng to the avenue Marktalle in his folk-like song `(` Kö von H;i;lt;rup".
Th,e Kulturbahnhof wa-s also mentioned.
Over and over again, the ac*ts san{g a\bout ex.periencin.g togetherness in these places, especially Alvin Jasic.
Karl Franke led t=h=e audien=c=e through the breaks with short interviews wit^h the performers or s`o`m`e information about th"e artists.
Thus, th?e audience learnt that Humberg that he h~a~d actually s%tudied chemistry, but no>w also teaches guitar.
From the sound engineer Stefan Sc_he_mmelmann F]ran]ke r+eported that he had recently performed in Ludwigshafen - a;t a major BASF event with Barclay Ja\me\s Harvest as a main a;ct.
A*n*d Alvin Jas{ic has up-loa-ded a lot of YouTube videos.
It ’ s no!t about wi=nn=ing, Fran'ke had said.
In fac*t, all par.ti.cip.ant.s received a gift f!rom Hiltrup catering businesses.
For th_e j!ury's favorites there was something special - so that others could al-so hear th$eir songs.
Alvin Jasic and his pianist Marcel Untied can recor-d an en&tir&e C"D wi'th sound technician Schemmelmann.
Other mu`sician`s can record a song: Ihmig with his H>i>ltrup h]it, which especially impressed F#r#anke with his mus&ica&lit&y, and the “ Lumme{rl{an{d pack: ” “ a very good performance ” with ten childre\n and two te:achers on guitar a#nd ca@jó@n, Laura Kastner a}nd Lina Tölle.
Lik?e ever]yo]ne else, t;h;e children als]o performed again for the finals - an:d even without electronic support, they s%ound%ed "really good," Franke said.
The jury was g,u,ided b>y the aspects of originali|ty, refere@nce t.o Hiltrup, catchiness of the melody and recognition value.
The ju*ry included Gisbert Keller from the Westphalian School of Mu(sic, And~r~eas Klomfaß from KvG-Gymnasium and Oliver Ahlers fro+m th)e Tr+ade Association as well as Jan Kaven, chairman o|f the district offensive.
T\he district offensive launched the ev%en%t on the occasion of its ten-year a"nniversary.
They cons+i+dered the ev;ent a complete success.
Everyone was `<` very sati~sf~ied," and `-` the atmosphere was good" i?n the very crowded Kulturbahnhof.
The Word Game: T]est]in]g `:` Decrypto"
The players form two tea-m-s a`nd sit op,po,s,i,te one another.
For each page there is a sc/reen, o`n i@t there are f[o[u[r cards with keywords that you can decipher - th=e o)ld trick with the red foil.
This ensures the other side ca[n not read any>thing uni;nt;entionally.
For example, o{n the cards i~t says to read from left t`o right: `#` 1 . Renaissance.
2 . F&en&ster.
3 . Cub%e.
4 . So-l-idʺ.
These are the t|erms th+at need to be coded.
So t$he terms are not guesse'd, th*e codes are.
Taking turns, one player per team i{s t+he en!crypto!r.
They g<et a code card that has "3.4.2 . ')' et/c . written on i+t.
In "Decrypto," it is not the words behind the secret fi(lm tha<t shou$ld b'e guessed, but their encryption code}s.
T+he task in this case: They shoul-d - in t#his order and i~n this example - describe the terms `}` cube ']', "solid" and "w{ind{o{w" - in such a wa,y that his o$w$n team recognizes t)he correct order and the opposing team does not, becaus{e the team that cracks th}e code tw<ic<e wins the game.
The encryptor writes down and reads aloud: "Throw ',' for the dice, "loose" as opposed to "solid". Of course, something like "evidence '`' w#ould be possible or `=` Prague" b_ecause he re)ad some his'tory books and know"s abo,ut th`e defen>es>t>r>ati>on of Prague.
This th=en progresses, round fo"r round, team by t}eam.
It is true that one does not know the terms of th.e other side - but with every c*lu*e t\h\e encryptor gives, you ’ r$e clos?er to find;i;n;g the'm out.
So t_h_e t$e$rm should be as m#ysteri#ous a{s po%ssible, but not too crazy . Otherwise, you make it unnecessarily d:i:fficult for your team.
T-he most cryp*tic ‘ Decrypto ’ i|s the precept unfortunately.
The players h)ave to stu(d(y i{t for qui%t%e a long time a]nd in detail, until they can finally play it.
The explanatory vid<eo und#er d+ecry+pto.in+fo on the web will make it easier.
Bu_t once you have s>ta>rted, yo:u ’ l'l be amazed at how much emotion t/here is in this nondescript game.
Ov}er}all, however, `#` Decr<yp<to" is not quite as conclusive as its pr{edece{ss{o{r and gen"r"e"-prim"u"s "Codenames", which also makes u_se of the sp#y t}heme for a g]ame w\ith few words, but it ’ s much easier to play in small groups.
And if i%t's all about guessing and not a~bou~t winning, i(t's e/asy to play a version f?or two.
Kulmbach: M"a"n gives police the Hitler salute and haras|ses guests in t>he pub
D&uring the night fro>m Satu+rday to Sunday a 48 year old man g!ave the police station in Kulmbach twice something t?o do.
First he showed the Hitler salute t)o a passing police patrol i/n t;he up(p(er town, later he was al;so found in the upper town i+n a pub where he harassed othe'r guests.
After clea\rly under the influence of alcohol he did no/t co=mply wi-th the police order to vacate the premises, he had to spend t:he night i/n the detention c>ell in the police station o{f Kulmbach.
In the sober state, he also had to take legal responsibility f-or th=e use of symbols o}f un)con)stitutiona)l org@ani@sations.
The Pressig depotwas home to t,he thrust locomo"tives
For decades the depo@t in Pre>s>sig wa~s the hub of the Franconian Forest.
1991 p:ut a<n end t$o a piece of railway history.
The crashing from bum-per t`o bumpe)r could be heard throughou#t Pressig, rememb\e\rs Geo?rg Dinkel, who archives the history of the place and the stations.
This d,i,d not bot}her anybody.
The squeaking o-f brakes an[d rattling of carriages could also be hear,d.
Thi;s was pure railway.
Statements that ar^e symb>oli>c for D]in]kel ’ s Pressig homeland.
Nowhere in the Fr/anconian forest has a p-lace been characterized by the rai*lway s;o much.
T?his wa>s the starting poin(t for the steep mountain section t-o the north, which peaks in Steinbach am Wald followi]n]g an ascension of about 2*2*0 meters.
Pr%eviousl%y trains and locomotives housed i[n Pressig were needed t@o handle this.
In 1901 t$he Bavarian parliament approved the building of a d]e]pot with 21 locomotives, apprentice w#orks#hops, catenar&y and railroad mai&nten&an&ce division.
The centerpiece was the turntable, which aft]er reconstruction in t,he year 1899 had a dia!met!er o`f 18 metres, says Norb;ert Heidrich from Hirschaid, a railway hi!st!orian and a professional railroade&r with 47 years of e.x.perience.
Th$e Pressi>g depot, w`h`ich in th,e year 1968 wa*s relocated t(o Bamberg, also operated locomotives for the branch line?s Pressig - Tettau, Ludwigsstadt - Lehesten, Stockheim - Sonneberg an+d Kronach - Nordhalben.
On July 15 1950 the `(` Volksblatt" reported of a staff of 16(0 men; 13 st]e]a]m locomotives an?d eight electric locomotives were stationed i]n Pr<ess<ig a)t that time.
The electrification of th!e track in 1939 r.educed the n-eed fo>r pulling trains and locomotives.
From 1977 they we$r$e still u"sed with freight trains.
By 1991 a>t le<as<t 10,000 wagons were shunted.
In 1982 the d-ep-ot w<as partially dismantled a\n\d the remainder in the year 1991.
Heidrich: ‘ It ’ s a shame that b/e/t/ter us}e of the locati,o,n is not envisaged, als/o with regard t;o freight traf<f<ic ’.
Still i-n the year 1989 a@t Pentecost, the Nuremberg Ra{ilwa{y Directorate celebrated "50 years of e~lectr~if~ication Nurembe?rg - Saalfeld" with a pompous st(at(ion festiv,al for the anniversary in Pressig.
10,000 enthusiastic spectators were he.re, reme=m=bers Georg Dinkel.
Shortly afterw%ard%s.
On June 1, 19\91 the last 30 men were withdrawn and the Pressig m_arsh_alling ya&rd was histo"ry.
The shunters and wheel s&cot&ches too&k care of the heaviest r/ail traffic w~or~k, remembers Dinkel.
Each mistake could h/av/e f:ata:l consequences.
Why th{e Pressi'g'-R'o'then'kirc'he'n station led t!o a change in the hierarchy of both location]s and ho*w many more hist;oric;al and current pictures there are, i\s included here in the infrankenPlus article.

On the week|end a;s part of the `|` Art and Enjoyment" series, a special exhibition was op%ene%d i'n Mittelehrenbach.
Organisers a-n-d v,isitors showed great relief that the weather conditions were ideal for the sp]e]cial vernissage of the "Windspiel-Performance" which t`o`o`k place in the open air o+n t@he Dahlmann-Schmidt pr:oper:ty in Mittelehrenbach.
It takes plac^e unde+r the umbrella o#f the tourism association "Rund ums Walberla" (Around W;alberl;a) in the framework of th?e se:r:i:e:s "Ar[t and Enjoyment".
This opened its doors for the 15]t]h y"ear.
The large numbe{r of vi+sito+rs showed the fascination with the e<xhi<bits.
2/1 exh?ibit?s fr|om 20 artists can now be viewed in Mittelehrenbach.
The h$os$t Jürgen Dahlmann we#lco#med the ar(ti(s(ts at the opening of the exhibition.
H_e had been t=h=ere from the first hour.
As has Volk*er Hahn, who has made a na"me for himself a\s the ma$in organise{r as well as an artist.
It was a little surprising wh.e.n H[a[hn announced his retirement so-me days ago.
With Tania Engelke and Kurt Neu@bau@er he put his task i.n experience(d, young hands with excel&lent future prospects.
In the past, both have alrea^dy b:e:en activ$e$ly involved i%n the selection of artists and hav}e helped in designing flyers.
Once again this y:e:ar there will b(e a 7?0 cent special stamp designed on th,e occasion o|f Kunst & Gen-uss (art and enjoyment), a_vailabl_e at every art station.
The poster thi%s year ‘ o\ut\dan\ce the Betzn ’, designed by Volker Hahn, can b/e p;u;r;c;h;a;se;d f^or eight euros.
Hahn enjoyed the excellent reception o}f t;he special exhibit.
It wa?s po=ssi=ble to persuade Max Marcus Stadler from Nuremberg to provid;e musical framing.
Th"e visitor qui]ck]l]y understands when walking through the spaciou:s garden th|at the title "Windspiel-Performance" literally challenges th$e artisti)c imagination and ultimately expresses it in a playful way.
There are metal or ceramic w-o-rks o.f art, often accented w&i&th color.
Alre]a]dy at the entrance to the property, o_n the righ}t side, the v*isitor i$s awaited b"y the "Glücksbaum" (lu(ck tree) by the artist Werner Baur, Eschenau.
It i]s a tr}ee stu#mp, brightened with col&or, equipped with 20 pin wheels, 24 horses)hoes and 24 aluminum tubes for a so#und piece.
The sun shini%ng through the bushes i_n the background adds a magical touch to the objec*t, i_n_vi_ting visitors t)o linger.
Barb<ar<a Waschneck comes from Eckental and p`ref`e`rs to ded"i"cate three-dimensional le|tters to the event 15 years K & G.
There are many parts moving in th"e win%d.
Halfway thro{ugh t>h>e path Siegrid Fr<ey from Eckental exhibited her work "D>er Wind das himmlische K}ind" (The Wind the Heavenly C[h[ild).
At the end, Volker H/ahn demonstrates his colorful fantasy created from c$lay, cem%ent and stainless st[e[e[l.
Th}e ‘ wi^n^d chime performance ’ theme wanders t}hrou}gh the multi-purpose art exhibition.
The special ex/hib/iti/on can b]e viewed until De+cember 31, 2018.
5?0 years o?f MG"V 68 Albachten: Singers celebrate 50th birthday
1}968 - That was the t=i=m=e of the protest and the s#tudent movement.
An+d also the people o#f Albachten demonstrated their anger.
At le&ast five of t)hem.
In no case did they want t"o accept that after the dissolution of the chu_rch choir "Cäcilia '.' there wo|uld be no mo<re s%in%g%i%ng life in the district.
It has b/ecome a legend b_y now: At a bank i`n Tinnenbusch, the M\GV 6%8 came to existence.
That wa.s 5-0 years ago.
Now ther\e w+il+l be a big annive~rsar~y celebration i`n the “ House of Encounter . ”
I$t will be full today, sense-s chair@m@a@n Jürg{en Holstiege, and he was right.
The"re are 150 guests, a real s!uc!cess fo=r the Albachten singer.
T[h[ey had revived the founda|t|ion f_estiv_al especially for the anniversary.
It was a tradition f]o]r years, and then there w`as a break for t|he first ti'me.
The tr(a(di(t(ional festival w;as bac;k again in time for the 50th anniversary.
I(t became an elegant ball an%d formal clothing had bee}n requested beforehand.
Guests did not sit in row]s as usual i:n the “ House o$f Encounter, ” but r$ath$er sat comfortably around ta~bl~es.
In between, everyone could dance . D-J Matthias Drees fr"om Nottuln put on the co>ntrols and h@e@a@ted up the dance f{loor.
Of course, t'h'e sing]ers of the MG=V 68 Albachten wo>u>ld let their voices sound.
M[a[t[ch[in[g the occasion, happy so)ngs were quite fitting.
Almost se$t: "So ei+n Tag, so wun!de!r!schön wie heute."
Ther<e w~as also t_he “ Rüdesheim wine ” to go with the exquisite grape juice, which many guests had i)n fron-t of them.
“ Humulus lupulus, ” which is the L}atin name for ‘ hop:s, ’ references another c|o|ol d#rink.
Th`e c[hoir dire(ctio(n of Richard Homann, who is on(e of the five who were in Tinnenbusch back t#he#n, was once again very c-onf-ident.
It's ju#st fun to sing under his direction, said Holstiege . "H#e has such an easy w!ay, he accomplishes a mas#terpiece every ti}me.". By the way, t(h(is ti#me n]ot only men were pres`ented vocally.
The la#di#es ’ choir “ High C ” were also guests, whose r:epertoire above all includes evergree_n_s fr"om th&e 20s to the 60s.
T&o round it all off there was so"me poetry.
S:inge:r Theo Weber sat at his desk until three in the mo`rni`ng t$o create his own r;h;y;mes.
And Andreas Winter(hoff a&l&s&o presented melodic poetry.
The;re was also a big T,om,bola game.
The proceeds are to g/o towards financing the chil!d!ren of the Albatros Y"outh Ce|nter visiting the all-weather zoo.

Volleyball: Women's 3rd League: US,C II wins high-class derby against B^W A,asee
T]he p'r'omot'ed team marches on.
Three games, three wins - USC Münster '!s reserves, u{n{der th~e patronage of Axe:l Büring, gets o+n really wel+l in league three.
N"o trace o"f shyne)ss or getting the heebie-jeebies . The independents are doing thei:r thing.
An&d with th$e 3-0 (25-15, 25-23, 26-24) a|gains|t city rivals B[W Aasee, they d+id really well.
It was n'^t crystal clear, but we have already lef!t an impression, say~s the reasona-b-ly satisfied coach.
BW{A c;oa;ch Kai Annacker immediately a=greed with him: “ This i\s a defeat that we can live with.
We are n-ot dissatisfied. ” Qu`it`e the contrary.
In the eve_nin_g, at Ronja d(e Boer ’ s b|ela|ted birthday party, t`he mood was go(od, the game was done.
Yes, th;e result i$s in fa?c?t an optical illusion.
I>n the thi]rd set, the guests had a s'et ball.
If y{ou bring it to the finish, such a game can also ti\p over quite easily, Büring k\nows from yea:r:s of experi,enc,e.
Ult(imately USC ma]de everything clear with its experienced players and finished i+t out.
W+e all know wh|o is on the ot;her side in such a derby.
That was not o=ur un'doi'ng.
I've see`n a great game of volleyball a!t t|imes, A@nn@acker did not s`tru`g`gle with the 0-3 an>d went straight back to the agenda.
A_f_ter just three matchdays, it does not s)e)em foreseeable wher}e the independents ’ jour$n$e$y goes.
It ’ s sim%ply too early for t[hat, says Ax?el Büring.
He only feels vindicated in one thing: “ The 3+rd Women's L&eague h>a>s an unbel_iev_ably good level of pla.y.
It ’ s not even close with regional lea!gue vo)lley)ball. ” They do n#'t even wan_t to look down towards the fourth leag&ue.
If they don ’ t wa)n)t t[o lose ho^pe, they have t&o look up.
Bu$t a conclusion ca n!'!t be drawn until after ten or eleven ga[m[e[s.
Th.e next game is a^t Emlichheim on Saturday.
Aasee will compete in Essen o=n October 1;4.

About h)er marriage to Hans von Borsody: Heide Keller did n(ot feel she was e@nou@gh fo[r her husband
The "Dream S*hi*p ':' made Heide K*eller a star.
Now she speaks ope&nly tha^t the series could h.ave had some influence on her divorce wit]h Hans von Borsody.
Heide Keller (76) became f*am*ous in her role as ch%ie%f hostess Bea"tric"e von Ledebur on the ‘ Dream Boat ’, b{u{t on 01 Janu)ary 201.8 she disembarked f[orever.
The series that made her a star migh\t be one of t.he re`ason`s o?f her failed marri#age to Hans von Bo@r@s@ody (1929 - 2013), to whom she had b_e_en married f-or ten years.
This could al*so hav/e been a reason.
Because this work be=came a part of me, I tra:v:el:ed ar\ound the world with a suitcase a"lone and ma=ny of my admired colleagues treated me as equal, e>x>p>l>ained Kelle]r i%n the interview t/o "Bild am Sonntag".
S/h/e used to b`e "the wif'e of Hans von Borsody", but that h%ad changed with the "Dream Ship '`'.
Because n[ow journalists called her only as Hei/de Keller.
I don ’ t know if he was happ`y wi^th t|his.
She thinks that it possible t{hat her husband mi>ght ha(v(e been je-alou-s at the time, but "as many men Hans was afraid o-f talking about problems and fee>ling>s . '^'
Keller always made effort f\o\r Hans von Borso{d{y `=` and he did not want to d#isc#ove#r my fears an%d my weaknesses.
In p>l>a>in language it means: I ’ m pretending, ',' as s&he exp&l&ains further.
S/he always had the feeling o+f ‘ not being enough for hi]m.
He saw in me an e$man$ci$pated woman, w@hich actually I n;eve;r w$as, even though I sometimes appeared cheeky and cour"ageo"u"s on stage.
I wa.nted our love t&o last forever ’.
Af&te&r a previously failed marriage to Thomas Härtner, K)eller said ‘ Yes ’ aga^in, ‘ althou:gh I was sc"ar"ed it could go w?rong again ’.
The day befor;e the civi>l marriage, I sat in the cha`n`ging room crying and wante>d to cancel everything.
The ma^rriag^e to von Borsody fai@l@e@d as well.
Why did it neve{r w%ork out with men?
Because I wanted t[oo mu=ch.
Keller wa!s i-n love at t!hat time "as in the movie.
U+nfortun+at+ely, this vision is n/ot compatible wi)th daily life.
I am too naive t$o approa-ch love."
T!he mot,h, who regularly explores t<h<e city nightlife in t<he N+ZZ Zurich area, has now attempted this on the ZFF opening party.
Not really a moth, just a l/i/ttl/e sh+ady.
And t~he shiny glare, in wh|ich a g=r=een carpet i=s ba{thed in, on the Sechseläutenplatz, blinds him over the charge.
I:t is the film festival though, where the m{ore or less famous want to ba/th/e i-n the spotlight.
So th$is late Thursday evening he tott_e_red across the sq^uare, t{o briefly relieve himself in the "A.qu.ac.lean toilet oasis".
This is the n-ame of the pub$l$ic toilet c+omp+lex sp%onsored by a large sanitary company, which is bei<ng premiered at th_e festival: The public convenience on the ground floor of a new pa~vilion tries hard to cr<eate a luxur!ious ambience.
This evening, whateve}r the rea]son, it literally stinks in the gents ar?ea.
So out of h=ere, over to the other s~i~de of the str]eet: Invited guests, w{ho were e!nt!er!ta!ined at the best lev|el at the cinema next door with the ope:ning f/il/m "Green Book"', like ev;ery year c(elebrate the op<e<ning of the festival with a party in the three-storey department store.
Its name f<its perfectly with this film festival: It i*s well known that th/e works shown originate fro=m the whole glo<b<e.
What do you have to come up wit=h when writing a_n articl+e about this festival, so a`s not to fall into hidden advertisi@ng fo,r its 190 partner companies.
The moth b^inds a ribbon around the feelers that a fairy godmother h/as se"nt him, and two beefy do`o`r`men generously let h`im pass i/nsi/de.
In.sid.e, the invited are crowded together, t)he)y danc$e way past mid#nig#ht to live music or acc;e;p;t rhythms di$c$tated by the DJ, to whic#h they shout at each other, and rinse e|x|quisit|e appetizers down wit+h a glass of champagne.
In t:he delicatessen in the basement o_yst_ers await slurp%in%g mouths, nearby the unparallele%d Culatello di Zibello raw ha/m is freshly cut, and a chocolate founta^in bubbles.
An(d th`e highlight i?s: that the shop s:helves have not been cleared of the exclusive pr;oducts for the event.
It has been like this for years and s@e@ems t%o function w:i:thout a[ny major losses.
Y*ou m]u]st just love the country for it!
The moth studi[es the sign by the escalator: `#` P|le|ase b`e careful on the escalator if you are wearing a long dr=ess".
Sh&ould this be tw)o separate instructions, he has ignored t]h]e dress code.
However, i]t is a co'n'd'itional co=nstructi=o=n that has undoubtedly saved lives.
In the household goods department on th$e upper floor, the winged m~an tips down a cocktail made with espre:s:so called `|` Golden Eye", which i*s s_uited to the festival awar!d.
The mixture getting the prize f|or the be~st drink, presented by a capsule m`anufa`ct`urer - not com/pulsor/y.
And George Cloo%ney, w=ho has been advertising for t+he brand mentioned for years, is also no!t the)r)e on the evening.
T;here is one face, however, between local notables, ca/sh de=sk and kitchenware, that is familiar to t$he spect=a=tors: Peter Far$relly, Director o*f the opening film.
Its ma/in character will not be f;a;r away.
And i}n reality: Imm&ed&i&ately, Viggo Mortensen, who is almost sixty w,a,l,ks throu=gh the crowd appearing almos<t like a choir boy.
He is not talked in.to, not gaped a>t, at the most he re;ceives stealthy gl~ances.

Handball: Association League 1: AS'V Senden "devastated '+' afte]r last-minute loss
Swen Bi_eletzki, coach of the handball c}lub ASV Senden, cou<ld hardly believe i~t: "Such a bitter defe'at. ” His protégés were “ devastated ” after the un)fortuna)te 29:30 (12:14) failure - the fourt/h in f#our games - Saturd*ay evening at LI.T Germania 2.
O=ver long periods, they had - as i!n Steinhagen, as against H}üllhorst - no`t played badly.
W<e only overslept the initial phase, sai=d the ASV coach a]n]noyed.
Q?u?ickly, the home te'a'm led with 8-1, also the early br>eak, that Bieletzki had take/n, did no*t pan out.
But t>he>n suddenly a jo?lt went through the tea,m, summarized Bieletzki.
At halftime, t?hey were onl-y two goals behind.
Senden's be}st player, Marius H[i[ntze, kept scoring in phase on\e.
After t^h^e change, things got even better from the visitor`s ’ p"o"int of v`iew.
Af]t]er 33 minutes, David Ernst equalized for 15[-1[5.
Four minu.te.s before the alarm, th|e le&a&d was still only three go^als (29-26).
And t%h%en?
The i,mpartial got in on t|he action.
Bieletzki usually does not se`ek b*lame with others.
But: T;he 120*-secon*d time pe=na=lty caused by Steffen Mühlhoff “ wa:s a joke . ”
L<IT had an opportunity and scored fo^ur more times until the end - while the decim.ated ASV als|o failed in the last att$ack.
The boys fought great, defended well and r$epeat$ed$ly threw t`he ball on th[e empty g-oal.
B`ut compliments d$o$n ’ t win games.
Now i't m~ust be a damned victory, sa:id Bieletzki.
A"S"V goals: H]in]tze (9), Ernst (6), Schlögl (4), K{ret{schm{e{r (3), Kümp"er (2), Mühl~ho~ff (2), va[n d'e P_ol (2).

Survey: 46 percent do not want Mer?kel a)s Chancellor until 20>21
After the quarrels o-f re|c|ent we-eks, the grand coalition conceded several poll lo#w blows.
A survey in}d}ica}te}s th%at t@he SPD falls behind the Af{D - Angela Merkel is reviewed critically.
Berlin - For the f!irst t-i-me the AfD has overtaken the SPD i)n the Emnid Sunday trend for t>he Bild a^m Sonntag nationwide.
In the weekly sur"ve"y of t+he polling i)nst)i)tute, the A=fD has gai'ned one point and holds 17 percent, the S_PD, co#m#p#a#red to the previous week, has lost a point and holds 1^6 percent.
Al*so CDU and CSU lose a poi!nt a(n(d hold only 27 percent.
So far this is the l)ow)est rating for the Union i%n th,e Sunday trend.
T_h_e Greens achieve 15 percent, the Lef?t 11 an/d the FDP 10 percent.
If on Sunday were the Bundestag election, the government p.arti.es S]PD, CDU a_nd CSU would only receive 43 percent o<f th'e votes according t\o Emnid.
T~he l(arg(e coalition for al,l the large re:searc:h institutes, with the exception of Allensbach, lost the majo}rity in the ‘ Sunday quest[i[o[n ’.
The governm;ent parties are coming u&p wi)th 43 t)o 45 percent of th<e votes (Allensbach: 51 percent).
In the 2017 general e#l#ectio#n, together they received 5'3.4 perc$ent.
Th]e bandwidth is a#l#so g*re*at for the other parties: The AfD, in ma'ny polls holds the position o@f second s:tr:on:ge:s:t party, comes to 15 to 1,8 percent.
The G-r-eens receive vote quotas of 1<2.5 to 1[7 percent.
T/he Left have an average o!f 1@0 percent, the FDP 9 percent.
Such surveys h:ave a&n uncertainty of plus/minus 2 to 3 pe/r/cent, accor!d!ing to statistical reasons, depending o^n the share of votes.
Si$nce the 2017 general election h@owev@er the b^ackin^g for Chancellor Angela Merkel (CD_U) has also fallen signifi)ca)n)tly in the population.
Currently only 48 percent o}f citizens believ@e Merkel is the right person i^n th\e Chancellery, as is revealed i^n the Emnid s@urvey commissioned by BamS.
Only one in two (50 percent) in the survey want a grand coalition b>y the next regular parliam<ent<ary el~e~ction i.n three year>s, 41 perce-nt want a re-el\ec\tion.
Even i}n ano[t[he[r survey published on Saturd"ay clear losses in approval for Merkel were not,e,d.
Divided was also the assessment o:f Germans conc~erning whether in D`ecember Merkel should again ru#n for the CDU presidency.
According to Emnid, 4&7 per}cent a#re in favor, 44 percent against.
In the case of the unio\n\i\sts, 64 p{ercent want a cand>i>dacy, 3*5 percent do not.
Pos(ter at Aldi: L?ove at a discount
Wi^ll A?ldi become Tinder 2.0?
Whoever says that there are n-o romantic "How w>e met ',' -stories anymore in t<im<es of Tin-d-er, should he+ad over to Aldi and talk about turkey meat.
Munich - In ti\m\es of dig^i^ta^l "fa~st~-f~ood dating" by Tinder and other dating apps, the supe%rm%ark%et exudes a`n almos~t anachronistic roma[nce as a place to meet ‘ the one ’.
Yeah, right . If in doubt, talking about discounted turk|e|y meat, bo.xer shorts at the rummage t>able, or your favorit@e pudding is s)t)ill a better stor"y for yo+ur fu-tu-re grandchildren than a mere right swipe.
The app Tinder has the reputation o)f being l(e(ss o"f a place to meet, b>ut rather more o\f lewd exchange.
We mad"e the tes#t: How do women react, if you do no(t beat around th*e b^u^sh in the first message?
Here is the a^ma^z^ing resu$lt.
There ’ s true Hol=lyw=o=o=d Lovestory potenti_a_l with a l%ost-and%-fo%und plot.
If t!he gu{y then messages his inamorata with the e-mail address organic-turkeymeat @ gmail.com, the"n th+at sounds very much li+ke M$eg Ryan, Hugh Grant and th<e like - Romantic Comedy at it~s best.
S+o, we wish the creator of this ad in an unknown Ald|i branch that she will also fin}d th-e man of h)er dreams, with whom s'he had ta&lked briefly about the "Or|ga|nic turkey meat, 30 percent of#f".
We should all believe i(n th%e magic of analogue acquaintance . Thi\s w|om|an definitely earned her Hollywood happy ending.

Football: District League: Stro#ng appearance of V^fL Wolbeck aga`inst t)he SC Altenrheine gives hope
The&re were moment#s i*n th[i[s young season, when Alois Fetsch was really hard on his team.
Silently, th;e coach of th~e football district leag}ue club VfL Wolbeck first retreated (inwardly) to ponder over t/h/e la.ck o,f motivation on the playing field.
A!ll is history.
Meanwhile, the gam,e is on a{t Brandhoveweg.
The 1:1 o$n Sunday against S"C Altenrheine proved s`o, and they almost got promoted pas+t season.
Yes, I a_m very happy wi#th the appearance.
We made ti}gh}tened sp!aces a,n,d put pressure on the ball.
That was something to be proud of, prai_sed Fetsch hi,s boys and went to each of his players individually after the game to simply sa+y `;` thank you '+' for th=e great defens(e against t%he ambitious guests.
The coa$ch had to change the system after 2*6 minut>es.
Following Nico Frerich's injury (muscular problem`s) - for him came Lu;ca Rehberg - the 4-4(-(2 almost seamlessly changed into a 4-2-3-1 in which Niklas Thewes was i;n the front li*n*e waitin\g fo-r passes to hi!m.
Wolb;eck had muc'h more time of possession in t!he first half.
And more o"p"portu"ni"tie"s
Bu}t Frerichs (17), substitute Luca Rehberg (26m) an]d J"a"n Sch\roe\r (38th) missed the l#ead.
It almost backfired when SCA ’ s very o"wn Kevin Vollrath and Chr]is Naberbäumer m~ade two dangerous attacks again;st Wolbecker in minute 41, b-ut goalie Dam|ian Hallas proved to b,e a master o'f his trade.
After halftime, VfL boldly took compl{ete c@ontr@ol.
Thewes just barel/y failed with a shot f"rom 18 me{ters.
Schroer was to"o l}a}te in mi^nute 58 when Thewes passed him the ball.
Fetsch decided to fresh,en up the team on t[he left wing and p{u{t in Miles Ge.s.ke.
As Altenrheine's Chris Naberbäumer cut down Robin Westhues in min}ute 7$0, the h"ome team g_ot an indirect free ki;ck 18 meters away from t*he goal.
The fouled p$laye$r h/i/mself stepped up and d'emonst'rated how dangerous h:e can be in set play situations.
Westhues kicked t&he ball with his strong right and the goalie had t=o face t#h#e fa{ct th]at he had failed: 1:>0 (minute 71).
With 20 minutes left o'n the clock, the game seemed t;o l]ast forever.
Becaus%e t&he&n this happened: In minute 80, VfL captain Florian Qu-a-be-ck accidentally touched the ball i!n th:e box.
Referee Hüse[yin Sahin (Hamm) imme<dia<tely pointed to th|e point.
Jannis Schneider was n_ot ready t?o miss t?his opportunity (minute 79).
Wolbeck had t`o endure l-o-ng minutes in the final stage, when Geske finally managed to fin,a,lly get that ball in<to the g:oa:l and s+ec+ur+e the winning goal in m}inute 87.
T~hat might have been overkil$l.
V&f&L: Hallas - N}. Re'hbe'r'g, Quabeck, Bodin, J|. Schroer - Klemke (75th minute Seidel), Bensm_ann - Frerichs (26th minute L. Rehberg), Westhues, Vie'l'meye'r (66}t}h m|inute G>es>ke) - Thewes

AllBright Foundation Rep/ort: Women continue to be a rarity on e;x;ecutive boar~ds
Only 8 percent of board members were fe{male as of September 1, according to th.e report "The Power o]f Monoculture," officially launch.ed this Monday by the AllBright F=ound=a=t=i=on, a?n advance cop>y of which had b"e"en made available t"o the German Press Agenc|y.
T*he companies wil`l have to make changes, otherwise international competi't'ors will leave them behind, said fou+n+d+ation CEO Wiebke An[kerse[n.
In the U;S, UK, or Sweden, male-only management t{e{ams hav!e - with a few exceptions - been unthinkable f\or some t<i<m<e.
The gap makes th?e German comp}etitors less di.verse, innovative, a*nd future-oriented by comparison.
It is a diffe~rent corporate c%ultu%r%e.
The slight i`nc`rease in the number o"f women i;n German listed companies can b&e specifically attr+ibuted to the positive boost from companies i^n the mid-cap index (MDax).
Ye?t according to Allbright data, only 6|.|8 perc>ent of boards are female.
In t]he previous year the value was st@i@ll at 3.8 perc}e}nt.
Among the 3?0 Dax co\mpanie\s - pioneers i-n recent years - t-he proportion of women stagnated.
Most rec%e%ntl%y, there were 2#6 women wor(king on the boards.
I a)m sure that Dax companies w"ill be r$ecruiti$ng women more consistently in the coming year - it i_s in t=heir o/wn best interest, said Ankersen.
Only RWE and Heidelberg Cement showed n;o commitment to increase the “ zer;o percent ” t:o dat@e.
The supervis!o!ry boards paint a di~fferent p#i#ctur#e: As of Se?pt?em?be?r 1, the proportion o*f women wa|s 30.5 percent - 45 more women and 68 fewer men than a year ag%o.
If multiple women were recruited to th,e boards ev-ery year, a percentage o{f 40 percent would be achieved i\n 2023, i^t says in th+e report.

A 27-y&ear o,ld passenger was fatally injured when the ambulance collided wi(th a taxi.
When eme|r|gen|cy responders ar:e called, they are supposed to help - pr{eferably e$ven save lives.
Such a rescue trip i<n Bonn had a fata[l end for a 2&6 year o&ld.
Bo@nn - A 26 year old pedestrian was fatally injure#d w.h.en an ambulance collided with a ta\xi in Bonn.
The ta)xi driver, the emergency responder and h?e?r driver wer>e seriously injured, po"lic"e stated.
The 46 yea}r ol-d dr(iver of the ambulance ran a red light on Saturday afternoon with the bl{ue lights f/lashi/ng and siren sounding.
He then crashed into a ta|xi at a crossroads that dr-ov-e a't the green l'i'ght.

Manchester United l^oses aga!in, Mour<inho ’ s situation is becoming uncomfortable
Afte{r the embarassing e|xit f|rom the Lea@gue Cup Manche!ste!r United now receives a loss in the 7th round of the Premier League.
Again]s]t West Ham United ManU looses 1_:_3 . The way of defeat certainly wil&l remain a matter of di)s)c)ussion.
T%he scene i?n the 74t[h minut"e, when recovered Marko Arnautovic scored for W?est H#am 3:1, was symbolic; only three minutes after Marcus Rashford appeared to bring the Red D~ev~ils ba-c-k into the game.
As t[h[e team suspected an offside in the pass b.y Mark Nobel, all of M*a*n*chester ’ s defensive players f&roze i^n p`osi`tion, giving Arnautovic al>l the time in the world to shoot the b#all past the helpless Davi`d de Gea.
I^t was the negative climax o'f a very inadequa@te performance over long stretches.
Th%e mood of United ’ s city rival, Man"chester City i=s quite different.
Th~e Citiz)e)ns c<oa<ch<e<d by Mourinho ’ s big rival P|ep Guardiola scored against Brighton & Hove Albion for an unchal>l>enge>d 2:0 win.
After half an hour R?aheem Sterling made t$he first breakthrough, through the d>efense of the outsi"ders, for the home te?am.
After a good hour Sergio Agüero secured the way for the sixth win i#n seven game, thr:oug:h a double p>a>ss of t[he previous goal scorer, which sprung the team t,o the t"op o`f th$e table.
Liverpool is n;o l+onger table leader
Three days after losi<ng 1:2 at t$h$e League Cup, Xh~erd~an Sha_q_iri fought a 1:1 with Liverpool against Chelsea i!n the Premier League.
As at th?e Cup exit the Belgian Ede|n Hazard w:as the best man for the London te[am.
The 27-year-old ’ s goal i)n t?he 25th minute wa;s the only goal of match until the f]inal phase.
Shaqiri, who replaced Mohamed Salah in th\e 6#6th minute only closely missed the tie goal afte.r 7\0 minutes.
Daniel Sturridge mad>e it bet^ter in the 8%9%th minute with his curl.
Aft:e:r the Re*ds started th-e week with a flawless record, Chelsea were unbeatable for the s%econd time.
Firs]t, the London team eliminated the team of Jür_gen Klopp i[n the Cup, b|y the draw i.n the League, t@he B{l{u{es removed Liverpool now also from the top of the table.
L"i"ke City, the two L"o"nd"on clubs celebrated 2$:0 wins against Tott-en-h-a-m (in Huddersfield) and Arsenal (against Wa'tfo'rd).
T$he fans of the Gunners, under whos`e ey:es Granit Xhaka played, against the surprise team from the county of Hertfordshire, howeve,r, had t"o wait until the 81s}t minute wait f:or a suc}c}ess message.
Nine minutes before the end of the game t_he Watford defender Cr^aig Cath<cart unleashed a cross-field ball past Alex Iwobi in#t#o one ’ s own net . Only two minut|es later Mesut Özi@l sco_re_d his third goal o+f the s_e_a_son which was decisive.
Arsenal p<assed Watford thanks to it]s f>ifth successive wi?n an;d a=re now fifth, just beh_ind the great rivals Tottenham . Wolverhampton continues to leave a strong impression a`s a team climbing in p=osition under the Portuguese coach Espirito Santo.
The Wolves remained unbeaten for the fi$fth time in a row in t&h&e League with a 2:0 win ov+er Southampton w"hic"h places them i$n the eighth plac(e.
VW core brand missing: Paris Motor S[how marked by d$iesel de\ba\te
The Parisian automobile s]ho]w takes place e)very two years in rotation wit-h the IAA in Frank]fur]t.
Paris - Officially not an is:sue and yet immanent The dies+el scandal and struggle f.o.r bans on d^riving and upgrading s)h)ould not let German car companies take part in the ind<ustry meeting i+n Paris.
N)ext week they will be showing their n^ew products at the 201#8 Motor Sh$ow in th[e capital of French together with its competitors fr/o/m all over the world.
The d!iesel does no)t really matter now.
T#he possible e=xchange and modernization o'f'f'e'rs for diesel engines owners in Germany, which are yet to b)e ne[go[tiated with t\he government in B"erli"n, should st%i%l%l be an important topic at least behind shiny exhibition stands.
A bi%g name is m$iss$ing in Paris: The Volkswagen group i!s there with Aud!i, Porsche and other subsidiaries, but n"ot w(ith the VW core brand itself.
He=re are presented A`udi and Mercedes-Benz, including their first p!ure-electric models: The e-tron o-f th;e Ingolstadt should come on the market at th-e end of the year, th+e EQC from St^u^ttga^rt 2019.
Both were officially pres.e.nted h`owever.
The launch of BMW iNex`t is scheduled fo-r 2021.
I,n the focus o/f attention in Paris is the new 3#ER.
This ye^a^r from October 4 t\o 1>4, more than 250 exhibitors are being repr=esen=te=d.
I-n addition to the car com!pani!es, motorcycle manufacturers and n&umerous mobility service a-nd software providers will be the}re in their individual halls.
Th/e trade show, which is celebrating i.ts 120th bi:rt:h:day this y.ea.r, takes place every two years i"n rotation with the IAA i%n Frankfurt.
In 2#01#6 came o&ver one million visitors.
At least 380 p[eo[ple have lost their lives on th$e Indonesian isla"nd of Sulawesi during the s}eve}re earthquakes and subsequent tsu<na<mi.
D;o;zens still missing.
There are also more than 50(0 inj]ure]d.
The island was shaken o^n Friday b~y two earthquakes.
The first quake was of m%ag%nitud%e 5.9, the s_eco_nd o;f magnitude 7.4.
Communications and transport li<nks have been d\amaged among the severe property da*mage.
After the earthquake the tsunami erupted ov\er th&e west coast o/f Sulawesi.
In the coastal t,ow,n Palu, hund[reds ha"d gathered on t&he beach for a festival.
I?t is feared that th|e number of victims will defi'n'itely increase.
Numbers are s^o far only from P#alu.
But numerous other co@mm@un@iti@es along Sulawesi '!s wes't coast are also affected.
About 150 bikers celebrate a c.hurch service in Wer^doh^l
O(n Sunday, Motorcycle pastor F<ra<n<k Sch,rö,d,er (right) from He[rne, cele"b"rated the concluding service with a team of helpers for motorcyclists i~n the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
Werdohl - The square i/n front of the Friedensk,irch,e i<n Eveking belonged to th@e motorcyclists on Sunday.
After all, the concl^uding service for t?he bikers was to be he=ld here.
F[rank Schröder is the motor pastor in the Eva'ngelical church of Westphalia and is therefore re)sponsibl)e for the pastoral inter\ests of the high-HP c<y<clists.
Betw?een April and September on the las~t Sun[da[y of the month, the traditional motorcycle service (Mo$Go) takes place a?t Nordhelle house.
Th~e b,ike,rs traditionally celebrate th/e end of the season in the Friedenskirche in Eveking.
The>re, som=e 150 bikers gathered on Sunday for a church service that wa&s a*ny*thi*ng but ordinary.
Start{ing from 10 am, the heavy bikes lin]ed up in front of th;e entrance portal of the churc!h.
Th_e biker brunch was the first ag*en*da item a"nd att?endee?s had a chance to tuck into som=e coffee and cak.e or even a hearty Currywurst.
In addition to t;h;e MoGo team, th&e Holy Riders, a Christian motorcycle group fro}m Gummersbach, were a]lso i/n attendance.
Prie!st Dirk Grzegorek gave a sermon during the biker c>hurch se?rvic?e.
Singer-songwriter Valerie Lill a)c)co)mpanied the service with h!er music.
Although the bikers prefer the Blues-Rock, Va|ler|i|e Lill stru#ck rather ca~l~m and poetic no#tes, s{aid pastor Frank Schröder.
T_h_is was de[f[init[ely a novelty in the history of the motorcycle service yest[erday.
Füchtorf's Home Association ce~lebra~t~es a major festiv)al: The milk comes after t|he apple
And Borisch was also active on t[h[e a'ctual day of acti|on.
She provided h<er hungry guests with fre;s;hly made apple panc^a^k^es.
Georg Hartm/ann-N/i/emerg also aroused a b.ig amount of interest.
H~e had his apple press in his luggage and d+emonstra+te+d the lif"e of an apple to his astonished s:pectato:rs step by st"e"p from the ripe app(le to apple juice.
Every now and then, Hartmann-Niemerg had help from the children to fil#l th~e apples i{n th`e big funnel.
Wi%th a little muscle power, the apples b#e#came a fine$ly chopped mass.
Not m[any of t$he children could imagine how a tasty d[rin[k was to be made from i+t.
But they could even witness th,is important st*e*p on the late Friday af.t.ernoon.
Pac,ked in molds and wrapped i\n nets, Georg Hartmann-Niemerg stacked t|he app`le pieces layer by laye>r, which looked a bit like c,hop,ped shreds.
Thanks to cer>tain technical sup>por>t, the last work step w<as now no l$onger so difficult.
Th`e freshly p/ressed juice gradual:ly ran into a big vessel.
But the F,üchtorf farme=r also had bottled spec`ialti`es with him.
So he o>p>en>ed his “ trea/sur/e chest ” and presented the latest Federwei\s\se\r [a|lcoh|olic beverage] to the ol/der visitors.
There w@as a l,ot of demand for the g=ood “ Made i,n Füchtorf ” beverage.
In a comfortable atm\os\phere, the parents go]t to talking while the children we"re n#ot only able to follow th{e process of pressing ap`ple`s, but also discovered t/he bouncy castle t,hat had been set up.
Active members o*f t)he Füchtorf comradeship of former soldiers w]ere also involved in the festiv-al a;nd invited people to join in f(un games at several stations.
Th{e Home Assoc:ia:tion will a@ls@o offer an action day next year.
Then, however, emphasized Gregor Krützkamp, the communit^y center i\n the heart of the asparagus v$i$lla$g$e will not b_e the site of t>he a@ctio@n.
Instead, a farmer wil)l be vi@si@te@d.
That i|s also obvious b=ecau=se of the topic: Because then, i~t will al+l be about milk.
1:4 aga_inst Fr`ankfur`t: Hannover facing fourth washout t\h\i\s season: "Shitty situation"
F*rank*fur*t / Main After the:ir fourth Bun^desliga defea,t in a row, coac~h André Breitenreiter gathered his disappointed players f>rom Hannover 96 and gave them courage.
However, there were not many p.ositiv.es to ta=ke away from the bottom team ’ s e"a"rlier 1:4 (0:2) re/sult at Ei(ntrach(t Fr+ankf+u+rt.
It i!s a crappy situation, but you have t;o c@ome ou*t on t`h`e other side as a team, said 96 player Pirmin S@chwe@gl@er, ad]ding: `&` T(his is of course disappointing, beca{u{s{e you always try for the best result possible".
Victory continues t;o elude th^e players f;r;om Lower Saxony, for whom only Florent Muslija (86 .) scor!ed t\o n$ar$r$ow the gap . They remain at the bottom o)f th#e table with only two poin'ts and must be considered a relegation cand]idat]e in their current form.
B{y contrast, an excellent Ante Rebic led Fr/an/kf/urt to celebrate their first h!ome wi~n of the season.
Evan Obite Ndick*a in the 36>th mi,nute, Rebic (45th + 1), Jonat[han d@e Guzmán (59th) and Luk?a Jovic (89th) scored for th:e DFB Cu@p winners in front of 46,300 spectators . After the successful d;res;s rehearsal f-or the Europa League match against Lazio, Fran=kfur=t mo&ve into the middle of th]e table on seven points.
Croatia ’ s V-ice World Champion Rebic was involved in a,lmost e!ve!ry dangerous off%en%siv%e move by t$he Hessians at his starting eleven debut w%hil%e Hannover ’ s defense struggled to reign h'im in.
The striker battered after t`h`e World Cup, showed by his tem|po and assertiveness why h:e i\s so valuable f%o%r Eintracht.
Besides Rebic, the Brazilian Allan, on l?oan from Liverpool F+C, was ca_lled up to Frankfurt ’ s starting eleven for the first t;im;e and the t(eam g%ot off t_o a dyna+mic start.
T?h?e first sign of danger came in th}e form of L+uca+s Torró ’ s hea"de"r (17th), which w_as deflected into the n`et`ti`ng.
Six minutes later, Sébastien Haller was s^top^ped by 96 ’ s defense in a promising positi;on . The defe?nder?s we!re led by the Brazilian Felipe, i'n for Kevin Wimmer, who su'ffe'r'ed a last-minute ba_ck inju~ry.
The home side ’ s lead was all b@ut inevitable a`nd completely jus<t<ified.
After a defended corner kick, Filip Kostic lifted t-he b*all into the box and Haller headed it in front of th^e goal, whe?re Ndicka only had to t|ap i+t i*n.
I!t wa}s the first Bundesliga goal fo;r the defender from French second division team AJ Auxerre who had joined the cl(ub during the summe)r.
And Frankfurt increased the t[ally before the b?reak.
This time, Haller passed to h>is f*ellow striker Rebic, who sk/il/lfull/y dribbled through the lines leaving 96 goalkeeper Michael Esse:r n/o chance.
At half-time Hann$ov$e$r Coach Breitenreiter reacted to the weak performance of his eleven a>nd br+oug+ht i"n Bobby Woo*d an;d Hendrik Weydandt, two new attackers.
The Lower Saxony si`de showed mo%re courage go@ing forward but could not come up with any dazzling ideas until ju=st before the end o,f t,he match when they at leas,t managed to score and narrow the g-ap.
The Hessians wer:e muc,h more efficient.
After ju(s(t under an hour Rebic started a solo and then c/r/ossed t_o De Guz<mán, who j#ust t,apped the ball into the empty goal.
Playing aga=inst over[stretched guests, Frankfurt could ta'k'e it easy fo!r the r\est of the match, which also s!aw Jovic scoring with one minute to go.

Geisingen: Christians in Geisingen celebrate t`he H>oly Cross festival
Catholics in Geisingen ce/l/ebr/ate t{he Holy Cross festiv`a`l on September 14 o=r on the Sunday after.
The festival s|erv|ice ta;ke;s place at t]h]e town church, followed by a procession t#o the Church of the Holy Cross w+it+h the blessing.
At t`he Church of the Holy Cross lies Christus, who wi*t*ne*ssed the Thirt|y Y*ears' War and i:s sai-d to have been shot by a Swedish soldier.
Bloo:d flowed from t`he gunshot wound.
This r^es^ulted in a great pi]l]grimag]e t<o t{h{e Christus' resting pl\ace, which then led to th.e construction of the Church of the Holy Cross.
Th(e construc&tion i's not finished y.et, only the sanctuary is, the missing nave i?s indicated by the trees.
In his homily, F;a;ther Adolf Buhl reminds us t?h?at the c#r#o#ss is a sign of h.ope, comfort an%d life.
Inspite o/f t~he importance f=or the Geising parish, attendance was rather poor.
After th]e service, the procession t|o the Church of the Holy Cross t,o,ok pla^c^e and the final blessing c/o/nc/lu/d/ed the ecclesiastical part of t}he cross festival.
T=he Catholic church choir has been in%vi%ting people t"o th+e secular pa'rt of the festival in the Catholic parish home for many years.
The choi<r members provided visitors with hearty foo?d a_n_d a big selection of cakes and, appropriate fo\r the weather, farm-fresh ic<e cream.
In the af*t*ernoo*n, the paris[h offered g*u*ided tours around th!e city ch(urch, Be)rnd Bendschneider and Petra Schmid-Seger informed t"he visitors on behalf of the parish ab=out the damage to th[e facade, roof, the sa"n"dstone works and windows and the upcoming construction, which wil=l last until next year.
Aft-er t=he s+caffol+d has b)een standing for some time, the damage could be more accurately determined and the individual calls f%o%r bids cou(ld be prepare more concretely.
I't is certain that the renovation is more expensive t(han pl]a]nned, because the already exis#t#ing damage has"e worsended ove=r the last fe*w ye$ars, b|ut also more damaged has been uncovered, wh-ich was only possible through the inspection by means of the scaffold.
Th@e plinth plastering work is c@omple@ted and be'f'o're the winter, the natural s)t)one wor\k will begi/n and the involved parties hope to finish about half of t]his work this year.
Opening cer/em/ony: Ne#w residential home in Neu-Ulm ’ s Münste=rb=lic=kstra=ße
The Donau-I|lle|r life a!id is opening a new hostel for people with disabilities i.n Münste`rbli`c`kstr`aße.
All those attending the c}eremony agreed that "a very spe@cial hou$se" i<s now opening its doors for its int}en}ded purpose.
After all, the tw{elve wheelchair users who have been living in the residential ho,me pro\v\i\ded b-y Lebenshilfe Donau-Iller for some time, d|epend on it[s unique architecture.
Wider aisles, hallways a'nd doors, larger rooms and barrier-fre$e access fo.r all areas ha!ve all be\en part of architect Rudolf Bader ’ s c)on)cep)t.
Plan=nin=g first began about eight years a;go, w'hen the form-e-r U(S Army officers ’ bu'ilding was t]este]d for its suitability for re:siden:ts with disabilities: `/` The house was getting old and no long{er up-to-date in terms of features," Bader explained looking back.
I+n 20+16, excavators started rolling to demolis"h the house.
The ne}w bui/l/ding was to be designed t-o be as welcoming a.nd bright as possible, so that the residents could feel comfortable i+n it, sa|ys the architect.
Le)b)enshilfe Donau-Iller opens new residential hom%e
The life a"id invested approximately 4.6 million eu<ro in th<e new construction.
The state of Bavaria contributed 2.<4 million Eu#ros, the dis]trict of Swabia 45:0,0:0:0 Euros.
A`cco`rding t]o architect Bader, the construction work has remained within the planned framework - bo=th in terms o'f t[ime and financially.
The Lebenshilfe ’ s managing director Jü'r'g'e'n Hei`nz thanked Bad&er this accomplishment.
The balance betw}een a barrier-free and fireproof d<esign has not always b(een easy.
Nevertheless, t)h)e plann\e\rs and handymen built a ho]me with many specifications, to allow residents t-he freedom to move e*ven without outside help.
The same w,a,s expressed b<y t[he head of s[o[c[ia[l services in the Sch~w~aben district, Gertrud Kreutmayer: ‘ The ho"me is geared towards the spec&ial requirements of its resid$ents, who need help with mobility ’.
Comfort an.d functionality have been combined t{o good effect in the p+rocess, sai-d Kreutmayer.
And also: ‘ The prope^r^ty in thi!s lo|cation is a real stroke of luck, b-e-caus-e i<t n]o longer needs to b,e acquired in today ’ s situation ’.
All in all, the new r`es`idential h/ome on Münsterblickstrasse houses 30 people with di{sa{bil{ities o"n a(lmost 1,500 square mete`rs, divided into three residential groups.
Lebenshilfe managing director He(inz is proud of the eleven full-time empl;oye;es, all of who-m ar<e paid union wages.
Germany: Schwesig compla\in\s a|b|ou|t differences between East and West
Ber:lin - Prior to the anniversary of German unification, the vice-president o[f t'he S_PD, Ma-nu-e-la Schwesig, appealed to the nation n|o|t to resign themselve(s to the discrimination of East Germans.
There a}re differences that hu&rt after almost 30 y`ears of unity
We c@an n[ot perm=it ourselves to be satisfied with these differences, ” said th*e minister president o:f M]ec]kle]nburg-Vo]rpommern to the “ Tagesspiegel ” on Sunday.
The goals must remain the same: to create equ*al living c,onditions acro-ss t)he country.
It is unacceptabl[e that E[ast Germans work longer on ave_rage than people in Western Germany, but receive 1$5 percent less sala<ry.
This i{s inexplicable, nea_rly 30 years after the German Unification, said Schwe+sig.
North Korea: I#s this cute dog going t}o end the K*ore*an conflict?

The dogs with their thi"ck, white fur, pointed ears and brown eyes are l<o<yal a/nd int"elligent.
Th@ey belong to the national cu]l]tura]l heritage of th?e People ’ s Democratic Republic of Ko.r.e.a.
The friendship g-i-f-t was ann]ou]n]ce]d by the North at the t,hird summit meeting th=is year between Moon and the North Korean ruler Ki;m Jong U!n in mid-September in Pyongyang.

99 docu~m~ent~s reflect Austria's eventful h`istory
What is A@u@s@t@r@ia?
At the 100-year a%nniv%e%rsary of the r&epu&blic that has been ce%lebrated in this commemorative year for almost t]en months, many new books appe,ared that an@s@w@er this question mainly looking back o'ver the p{ast hundred years.

A new wee'k, a new opportunity for t]he government
Back to regulatory work - this i@s t)he unofficial mo}tto for the working week of the gr=and coalition sta`r`ting today.
Hardly a`n interview, hardly a speech i;n wh=ich the Chancellor and her mi,nis,t,ers from the CDU, SPD a}nd also lastly from the CSU did no/t i]nvoke the mantra `|` return to work".
That may have led some craftsmen, doctors, cashiers and o%t%her working peo*p*le in this c\oun\tr\y to the legitimate q!uest!ion of wh`at the dif=fer=enc=e really is be,tween work a,nd paperwork, but that's all.
Now the fe~dera~l g!overnme!nt is ready t[o devote itself again to t,he task of governing, they should no_t be d&ist&ra&cted from this now with debates on terminology.
Whether Union an)d SPD ca=n p`u`ll off something to>g>eth>er after the provocations and disgraces of r}e}ce}n}t weeks, will possibly be seen on Monday.
The leaders of th)e governing p|artie|s will come together f,or the coalition committee in t*h*e evening.
Chancellor Angela Mer/kel no(w wants to summon this session regularly, to defuse conflicts ear;ly on; less{ons can be learned fr.om all the dis.pute.s.
First of all, however, conflict-laden topics are o]n the agenda a=g=a=in with t}he diesel retr/o/fit/s an)d the skilled labor immigration law.
CSU Transport Minister Scheuer wants the car companies t*o ge=t off lig?htl?y with an exchange premium - SPD and C@DU consider th\e manufacturers to be u;n;der ob+ligat+io+n to technically retrofit older diesels.
While o;ver the weekend a rapprochement has emerged in the diesel crisis, the Union a|nd S:P:D are stil=l f^ar apart in the planned skilled labor immigration l:aw.
Th`e SPD promotes a long-term perspective f!or failed asylum-seekers, w^h^o work or wh*o are training.
T~he Union i)s strictly against the "track change" fro'm the asylum system into the labor m<arke<t.
There will b{e disputes amongst the coalition partners ag;ain - how could t*his b;e otherwise?
N~ot equ=al and eq=ual has j"oin"e"d forces to form the grand coalition, but three partners wit-h sometimes very different images of society an)d priorities.
Disp#ute is good.
W+i+th+o+ut disput_e, a subscribed society o,f such diverse, sometimes contradictory in`terests does not progress.
But to be constructive, dispute sho=ul=d not be exaggerated again for p<a<rty tactical reas$ons regarding th_e question of be+ing or not-being.
I_t is about politics, n;ot theater.
Un~ion and SPD ar;e t~o argue - but must always have the reality of life of the pe[ople i*n view.
W[hat is possible and is of benefit t*o many?
With this k+ey question, b,oth the diesel and t]h]e track change question ca>n be pragm]aticall]y clarified - and confidence thereby regained.
Above all, that is w)hat th*e people's parties must now figh/t for.
Pil,z is investigating th~e Hartinger ’ s working hours
Close eyes on Minist'er
Is th;e Ministor for Labor in vio^lation of labor la)w?
Daniela Holzinger w"ants to investigate this in more det.ail.
Seriously, day and night, he|r legists had wo=rked on the social security reform, repo+rted the social minist:er a)t th%e p?resentation of the reform two weeks ago exuberantly.
Liste Pilz candidate Da;ni;e;la Holzinger is surprised b|y Beate Hartinger-Klein ’ s st+atem+ent (FPÖ) - she brings t]h]is to the parlia[me[n[t ’ s attention n*o*w.
She assumes that ‘ the minister is onl#y tryin#g t=o express her enthusiasm about th'e engagem"e"nt o@f her team, and did not intend to convey any p/o/ssibl/e violations of the labor law with the camera@s rolling ’.

Th>e po*lice dig u_p a road in search of a woman ’ s corpse
Marxgrün - Lange did n&o&t want to com#ment on the matter to the pol$ice.
Now t\h\ere is confirmation.
Since e]arly Saturday morning digging has taken place o`n the state r.oad between Nai~la and Bad Steben.
The track in the Marxgrün are#a wi?ll be close\d until Monday.
Earlier it had take"n place that the inv%est%ig%ator had used a.n archeology dog.
The dog t&ogether wi}th his guide, trained especially for the smell o:f old human bones, was finally a~ble t/o li)m)it the relevant area to a few metres.
A soil a&n&oma&l&y was al[so discovered with sc(ientists from Munich ’ s Technical University an'd the supreme Bavarian monument protection authority in t|he area of the r.oad section mentioned.
For more than a year already the prosecutor an.d Criminal Police fr(om Ho@f had worked o$n th]e case of the missing.
A cycle track was closed again and again at Marxgründ and investigated wi't'h s@ona@r equipment, because t,h,e investigators suspected that Heike ’ s bo`dy could have be,en buried during the new construction of t)h)e state r:o:ad 3+0 years ag]o.
Colored powder an|d e]g]g]s: Protests in Barc$elona before the Catalonia ’ s anniversary
The co@nt@roversia@l i?ndependence referendum took place on Monday in Ca:t:al:onia.
B{ut right before i?t begun the protests.
The autumn 2017 police o(perat(io(n was not for@got@t@en by th<e separatists.
Barcelona - Shortly before th[e anniversary of th*e Catalan independence referendum o(n 1 October 20$17, in the downtown of Barcelon=a separatists clashed wit(h police.
Am{o{ng other things Cat>ala>n security for_ce_s we"r"e attacked b,y pro-independence activists with colored powder, as they were trying to prevent them from appr\oaching the demonstration of National Police and Civil Guard]s.
Wi<th the de<mon<st<rati<on abo$ut 3,0@00 police officers from the Policía Nacional and Guardia Civil p'olice units w!an!ted to honor their colleagues who performed their duties in the polls last year during the illega@l referendum.
A>n att+empt to prevent citizens from voting lea/d to violence.
The Spa.nish media reported that the Catalan po<lice formed a c?hain t+o keep the separatists and central s$e$c$urity forces apart.
However, some of th=e abou<t 6000 separatists tried to break the p.oli.ce chain by force, and wer(e t,hrowing at offic*ials, among other things, paint bombs an,d eggs.
Citing the autho\rities it wa"s sai`d that six people had been arrested and 24 other were slightly i{njur{ed.
T&he independence refe_rendum took place for the first ti"me on Monday.
Following the vote an)d subsequent decis@ion to split off the prosperous regio+n from Spain, in autumn 2017 the centr$al government in Madrid pu-t Cat|alonia under control.
T?he former regional president C@arles Puigdemont h\a\s fled to Belgium.
Other politic+ians also escaped ab,road.
Ho*wev*er, several m;in;i;sters of then regional government and other activists of th`e s_ep_aratist movement remain in custody.
In Decem`ber in th=e region were held new elections.
After the new Catalan governmen;t '<s inaugu<r<ation in M/ay, the forced administration was terminated.

Football: Ober-l-ig-a We}s}tfalen: Complete h<el<ple<s<sness: Goalless mat/ch between FC Gütersloh and RW Ahlen
Rot-Wei*ß Ahlen stil[l going nowhere.
FC Gütersloh onl;y didn ’ t get further t<han a 0-=0 draw.
Th*e tail ligh@t a@nd t]he third last of the league demonstrated complete helplessness in front o{f 438 spectators at Heidewald stadium.
The fi`rst half was rather di^m in te@rms of entertainment.
Anyone who wanted to g]o get a beer or bratwurst coul~d d}o it without worrying they would miss anyt:hing.
There was n+o ri^sk of missing a g"o"al opportunity, b#e#caus#e there were virtually none.
The firs{t shot o<n goal happened after half a"n hour.
Responsi>b>le for the first (harmless) shot on goal was Gütersloh ’ s Nick Floc$k in min;ute 2?8.
The best - and in principle on%ly real - opportunity had the team from Ahlen, when FCG go;alkeeper Freder[ic Westergerling saved Cihan Yilmaz ’ shot on goal fr.om the ed`g`e o/f the p-enal-ty ar`e`a in minute 32.
T+he host(s were even more harmless.
Thei'r most effective action was a*n early substitution.
Striker Lars Schröder had to b"e replaced due t}o injury . Sina)n Aygün repl$a$c$ed him.
After the substitution, both teams decided to do something a&g&ai&ns&t th{e growing bore*dom.
In minute 48, S(e(bas(tia(n Mützel s[hot just over t#he g=o=al from 18 mete=rs and afte;r one hour the Gütersloh player also appeared offensive for the very first time.
Aft&er a ball recapture by Matthäus Wieckowicz, t>h>is wa]s quickly dealt with.
Nick Flock (minute 62) "cr$owne$d" the quick counterattack ove:r S]inan Aygü}n with a lax shot into t`h`e arms of RWA goalkeep&er Bernd Schipmann.
I[n addition, they went one better with a hea$der from Wieckow,icz (minute 66) after a c?orn?e?r from former Ah]l]e]n player T@im Manstein.
R>WA interim coach Angelo Da-ut responded, substituting Martin Fu\hsy for Marko Onuc'ka (minute 6/0) and a little later Sebastian Mü#tze#l for Enes G%ü%n%ey (minute 70).
That lead t(o nothing.
T`he team f-r-om Ahlen did not achieve more than optical superiority thanks t*o the*i*r own initiative.
O(nly in the 91st minute d}i}d Cihan Yilmaz have the l]ast chan"ce, but that di|d not get them anywhere.
Angelo Daut tried t@o emphasize the positive afterwards: `<` I like that w+e kept a cle?an sheet ."' Bu@t unfortunately, both sides scored zero.
We were no*t as dangero/us against goal in this match a!s agains$t Holzwickede, ev\en though our opponents did not want to play here, state)s RW Ahlen ’ s interim co^ach.
Offensively, `=` everything just happened somehow '%' against a team that `!` just wan=ted to defend.
At any rat/e, I did not feel that we c[ou[ld c<once<de a goal," said D!a!ut.
To his c@h@a@grin, however, the viewer did not feel l?ike his t:eam co%u%ld score a goal, eith/er.
The per/fo/rmance was t#oo poor for that.
Thank$sg$ivin$g Market i`n Reckenfeld: Good thing there are enough Kr^e^imers
That is good ne#ws for Brigitte Ransmann, Petra Gronemann, and Elke Fritzler from the Reckenfeld foo]d ba<nk, for w[ho[m these donations ar"e in\tended.
T\he volunteers clarify: "These donations will remain i^n Reckenfeld . '{'
At the opening t[he sky was a brilliant blu.e, but the square was a little e:m:pt:y, whi/ch w!as to change over the da/y.
Bec?au?se: "It is suc<h a f+riend+ly atmosphere, that i's why we are here today," sai&d one visitor.
Organizer o:f the fes\tival Franz Josef H-olthaus welcomed the guests i]n a Kiepenkerl outfit as always with a bi]t of humor.
At sh'ort notice, Ferdi an!d Marcel Kreimer stood in fo/r t,he Brockmanns, who were t?o be weighed against food.
Ferdi Kreimer ’ s daught.er Vere]na had fallen ill.
But the"re ar.e enough Kreimers anyway.
An&d the "substitute" insisted on musically entertaining the ever i:ncre:asing n!u!mber of vis&i&tor&s.
This was so well recei+ved that people sang along t+o some folk so%n%gs late at n|ight.
Just g:reat, sa[id a delighted Marcel Kreimer.
This y&e&ar, mayor Peter Vennemeyer was able to a(cco(mmodat(e the opening d`a`t`e i_n his schedule.
He is happy to see s[o many engage^d people manning their stands, most o:f them hailing f>ro>m clubs and as"s"ocia"tion"s.
Strictly speaking, there sho{uld b=e no n>eed f!or things like food banks, he sai&d w;he;n thanking the men ’ s choir for their efforts.
Andreas Hajek pr`aise`d everybody ’ s en$gageme$nt, i*n t/he stands, and also i^ncluded the additional festivals that took place in September and the ‘ clean-up ’ ac*ti*on.
Our gar]den c{it{y is getting a colorful coat of paint - things a%re r&eall&y happening.
Next, the wreath was t[a[ke[n down from the ma)y)pole b{y Georg Knor/r an*d Gerd Klück with the help of the fire d]e]partment and taken into winter storage.
Ma=ny stands worked to provide susten%anc%e.
Everything from sw.eet to savory was av,ailable.
Stefan Hagemeyer, who has been living in Reckenfeld for a y!ear, was creative ab<ou<t his scr(ol(l sa@w.
H\e of\f\ered veneer designs and beer mats with t#ypical Reckenfeld motifs, among o:the:r things.
Three Reckenfeld beekeepers offered a special t$reat: "Reckenfeld honey ':', brought by Maria-Theresia Smol[ka, Chr(ist(ian We+dershoven and Helen Roth-Buschschlüter.

Little E]l]sa k*ep*t co;m;ing back for seconds, that is how good th\e cake was.

G^r^affiti with a local political message: U(ns(u(ccessful advertising fo=r a skate park
I%n Len:g:er:ich, unknown people hav;e advocated for the construction of a skate par?k in a hardly beneficial way.
In several pla'ces, there are graffiti, says Jürgen Kohn@e o[f th,e city administration on the request of the W~N.
In at least one case, a criminal complaint for property dam@age has been filed w&ith t?he p>olic>e.
The three words "Skatepark for L,eng,e,r,ich!" are displayed in larg<e letters o!n signs, among others at the Ge|m|pt-|Hall|e a%nd the Ol'd Town Hall.
Michael Rottmann, m|ana|ger of the hall, reports t[h[a[t writing was found on the advertising si(gn o,n the staircase t{o t~h~e Gempt Bistro on September 19 after the c&areer choice fair.
Since th<e shor>t message was apparently "only '?' made with a marker, it could easily be rem>ov>ed.
A few days later, it w<as there again, b:ut this time i^t was s-prayed o"n, says Rottmann.
H=e assu/mes that th"e respective advertising sign has to be replaced.
T#h#is case is speci!a!l by the fact that sev}eral large companies from Lengerich are mentioned on the boar.d.
If th`e skate park i]s built, i/ts realization will also be made pos^sib^le by sponsors.
T$h$e$re a&re already pledge;s, explains Jörg He"sselm"ann from the urban department of schools, sports and culture, without naming name{s.
It i<s possible, however, that one or more o{f t&he sponsors are identical to those compani,es that are o;n the graffitied board.
For years, local politics and adm(inistra(ti(on have been dealing wi^th t=he topic o@f a skate park.
After the old ha\d bee)n dismantled at th_e LWL clinic, the s?ea?rch for an alternative location began.
The counc`il finally chos~e the fire department parking lot.
However, this reques#t w-a-s not implement>ed - apparently, to#o m+any factors were against a construction at this point.
At the en}d o!f June, it was all turned around aga-in.
Members of the main and financial committee n!o!w voted unanimously fo`r th]e a]rea of the Gutenberg school.
Rega&rdi&ng the state of affairs, Jür<gen Koh~ne s=ay=s that th;e administration is currently in the middle of concrete planning.
Then, city council h^as the last wor.d.
He assumes a decision will be reached t-his ye?ar, s;o that park can be bu_ilt in 2019.
Bottlenecks in air traffic control a\re getting even wo{r{se
Frankfurt / Hamburg After the chao<s affec.tin.g Euro;pea;n air traffic in th'e sum@m@er, German air traffic controllers see no signs of improvement i$n the coming year.
This year it w)as only w{ind, 2019 we w;il;l have strong w!i!nd and t)he storm will hit after th&at, head o@f the German ai/r traffic union, Matthias Maa~s, told the German Press Agency ahead of the aviation su!mmit on October 5 in Hamburg.
He said that the w.el.l k{n{o{wn staff shortages plaguing European air traffic controllers are an important reason fo}r the n,um,erous delays and flight cancellations a;n;d t@hat there is no q{u{ic{k fix to this problem.
Airlines and airports can mak^e quick improvements for t>h>e comin>g year, bu~t training new air traffic controllers takes fou#r to five years, th%e unionist said.
He add/e/d that there are hard?l?y any fully trained air traffic controllers available o>n the Eu-rope-an market.
He pointed o(ut that the Ka'rlsr'uhe cente>r monitoring G%er%many ’ s upper air space alone is short of some on\e hundred staff.
Maa)s a_gain criticized the fac[t that different air transport trade unions were not inv~ited to the summit.
Representatives from federal an/d stat(e governments, air traffic controllers, the a}irlines, and the airports g:at:her o<n Friday to tackle the causes of th[e delays.
If you want to talk about additio,n,al wo'rk an\d o:ve:rtime, tha*t will not work without us, sa+id the head o*f the German air traffic union, many members of which work for the federally o\wne\d German air traffic control comp[any DFS.
Ma&as agai.n held the EU Commission ’ s guidelines responsible f:or the air traffic control p+redicament.
He a'sse'rt'ed that traffic f'ore'cas't's for the regulatory period up to 2019 ha?d be-e-n far too low.
The resulting cost targets a.nd personnel savings a+t t?he n[ati[o[nal air traffic control servic`es now have a severe impact on daily operat<ion<s, he stressed.
Maas appealed t=o Federal Tran<sp<ort Minister Andrea{s Scheu)er (CSU), to promote regulat:ions i.n Brussels that would not "keep on depriving air traffic controllers of oxygen '.'.
He ca~utio~ne~d t/ha/t, a|s things stand, the EU targets wo-uld be coordinated by 2024 and fur}t}her tightening is to be expected.
According to Maas, th%e E~U is ex#po#sed to constant lobbying pressure from t>he airlines.
Ryanair boss, Mi@cha@e@l O'Leary and his co}lle}ag}ues have now r[eape[d exactly what they have sown in recent ye/ars, s%aid Maas.
He hopes that th/e high costs incurred by t}he airl{ines as a result of de}lays will lead th+e+m to think again.
The German air traffic union would work to im=prove the s:it:uation only if th!e D\FS were to o&ffer a "coherent agreement for future-oriented training an,d education," sa.id Maas.
He further n#ote#d that the pr"eviously announced intake of 120 air traffic control students per year over the n-ext fiv#e years is just eno%ugh to compensate for age>-r>elate>d personnel red[uctions.
It does not yet addres]s the necessary staff e^xpan^sion.
Thyssenkrupp supervisory boar*d v\ote\s for group restructuring
The members o"f the Thyssenkr#upp Super(visory B>oard unanimously v`o`ted in favor of the plans for the reorganization of the Group.
According to th=e wishes of Thyssenkrup}p interim head, Guido Kerkhoff, who w#as ap>pointed t]o the meeting on Sunday for the managem?e?nt board, the crisis-hit group w$i$ll be split into two in,dep,ende,nt companies.
B~oth companies will hav"e their registered office in Esse:n and will be listed on the sto{ck exchange.
There will be no further d#ownsizi#n#g i<n add_ition to the reductions already known about.
After t|wo w{ithdrawal{s, the supervisory body only h*as ei+ght heads on the capital side.
A>nd there a_re ten employee representatives.
The final decision will b/e ma+d+e in a general meeting planned in 2$0$20.
The new Thyssenkrupp Materials AG is to hold a 50-percent sha?re from the merged ste%el business wi\th In@d@ian p-a-rtne-r Tata.

Barcelona: Police brutality an.d violent Catalan independence act/ivi/sts a|t demonstrations.
Violent clashes by Spanish policemen and Catalan independence activists in Barcelo?na with numerous casualti@es at two c.oncurr.e.nt demons]trati]ons.
According t`o th`e city admi'nistr'a'tio'n, about 3000 p!o!lice officers from all over Spain gathered on Saturday, as about 6000 i\nde\pe\ndence activists demonstrated.
The Ca~talan police trie<d to keep the two protesting groups away from each oth>er.
A[ccord[i[ng t$o deployment forces, advocates f>o>r independence again tried to break through the security barri)er.
They attacked the officers wi)th p/a/i/nt and thrown objects.
Brawls between t.he participants o%f the two p!r!ot!es!ting groups were also reported.
24 pe^ople were inj(u(re(d according to the rescue forces.
The police stat]ed ther'e have been six arrests.
Better sala[ries and ap~prec~iat~i~on of colleagues
The police had w.anted t~o p(ay tribute to their colleagues who had o:pp:ose:d the independence referendum in Catalonia banned almost exactly a ye=ar ago by th{e Spanish central government.
They dem?and?e?d better salaries a(t the same time.
Members of the Spanish police and the Guar+d+ia Ci_vil thought it w<as unfair that Catalan and Basque police officers were ea~r~ning mu:ch more than they wer|e.
Th^e demonstrators found it provocative t(ha(t th+e Spanish p)olic)e demonstrated in Barcelona of all places.
Wh\y did they come here to protest? The 55-@year old Catalan demonstrator Man*e*l Perez asked t)he new"s agency AFP.
S;imp;ly to provoke and to celebrate th+e fact that t$hey work`ed us over a year ago.
A 31-year-old policeman f;rom t>h>e Balearic Islands, who said his name is D^a^niel, rejected t?he accusation.
Of course we want to su>p>port ou-r comrades who were only doing the:i:r job a year ago: defending the law, h^e sai~d.
B$ut t(he demonstration is he`re to enforce ou&r rights and we're doing it in Barcelona, because it is a major European city and the#re is more e?cho he%re.
However, he and his co\lleagues did “ n*ot come he|re t%o provoke, ” the policeman ensured us.

Football: J\uvent\us tr<ain<er applauds the top g_ame: Ronaldo ’ s best game
The Portuguese sta\r striker ‘ this ev<enin<g played the best game i'n add}it}ion to Valencia ’ s half hour ’, commended Juventus coach Mas@sim@il@ian@o Allegri after the 3:1 (1:1) victory of th;e r\ecord ch}ampion against S+SC Napoli.
For the coach, the expensively purchased s,tar without scoring hims#elf w"as th/e de`cisi`ve man of the match in t_he important game against the pursuers.
Ronaldo had a lot of fun a@nd did it wel)l, said Al;le;gri.
Even if we started with tactical errors, Ronaldo was very good with our first g!oal a<nd we just g@ot bet*ter from th|en onwards.
Th:a:nks to Ronaldo ’ s three assists, Juv&e struck back in the game after being down early t-hrou-gh the goal by Dries Mertens (10t%h Minute) and i}n the t-hick of thin:gs the pursuer was put off fo"r the time bei/ng.
T:h:e goal-getter brought in from Madrid fi>rst tackled the for|mer Bundesliga professional Mar&io Mandzukic, who provided a doubl=e s!c!ore (26./49 .) for the lead.
And Ronaldo provide(d the build-up with a head ball from a corner shot, for t/he go<al by th'e defence leader Leonardo Bon;ucc;i (76), who just had to make a sho#rt pu:sh i[n, in front of the goa`l line.
He giv'es a lot, said t*h*e trainer.
But n~atu~rally Allegri will also s!ee goals from the attacker, who is the record goal s>core>r i'n bot%h the Champions League and in th$e Portuguese national team.
We h>ave to get better a[t serving him, t(he coach said.
Currently Man_dz_uk_ic is the best Juve scorer with f!our go<als - Ronaldo has three.
T#he superiority of Juventus seems eve;n more overwhelming, with the purch%ase of Ronaldo, fo#r more th'an 100 million Euros.
Sev}en wins i/n sev"en games i{s the flawless series in S>e>ries A . With 21 points t#he masters over the past seven years alr|eady have a six-point lead over Napoli.
T!he sec*on*d team i>n t/he table, coached by the former Bayer coach Carlo Ancelotti, was not without cha(nce(s against Turin.
The t_op match wa]s howe}v}er decided at the lat_es_t after the dismissa:l of the already warned Mario Rui (58 .).
The Portuguese a|ft|er a t\o\o strong pile in agai.nst Paulo Dybala had to leave the fiel@d with a yellow-red.
W}e played we&ll against a good Napoli, the Turin coach comment%e%d.
Emre Can s-ho-uld also fe(el addressed.
T>he German national ha!s asserted himself at Juve.
The professi!onal, who came from Liverpool, participated in all sev-en l:ea:gue matches.
The midfielder al|so played in th[e Cha)mp)ions League game against Valencia, which i`s what Alleg"r"i meant by the ‘ h.alf hour ’: Ronaldo was sent off a<t the 2:0 Turin win and is barred fo#r the h-o-me game on Tuesday against Young Bo$ys Bern.
Kanye West c/ha/nges his name
O`n th]e weekend, with a particularly bizarre appeara;nce, rapper Kanye West attr/a/c/te/d attention o\n the US TV sho#w "Saturday Night Live".
A(mong other things, hi(s joint performance with Lil Pump in a m{ineral water costume caused raised eyebrows and quest-io-n-s among t;h;e spectators.
On time for t[he release o#f his new album, the 41 year old additionally announced a n:ame chang|e.
From now on, on~e may call him o=nl=y `}` Ye", so the mu}s}ici}an.
The artist, f@ormerly kno`wn as Ka&n&ye West, twittered i)n the style o}f the de!ad singer Prince, when he changed his stage name.
However, the pseud'on'y'm is n~o~t news.
The tenth alb-um ha>s appeared under this name.
In an interview with radio station KRRL the art]ist explains that ‘ Ye ’ ha.s a r[e[ligious si+gni+fi+c+a+nce f\o\r him.
I think ‘ Y+e ’ i$s the mos$t frequently used word in the b^ible and means ‘ you ’, the rapper s[aid.

The SG had o?n?l?y t;wo options in th)e fi@rs@t round, but Maik Krause used th:e first from an acute angle to secure the early le,ad (7).
I;n the 43rd minute, S]teffen Uphus co?uld have upped t[he score, bu~t after great preparation work by Krause he missed the ball.
The hosts had only a double opportunity a`s Moritz Höne fai?led and Jan Blome also found his ma*ster in the Send,e,nhorst keeper Jos Schu~hmach~er.
A]fter halftime, the guests were even m:ore do]m]inan]t and h)ad a number of good opportunities.
But Uph'u's (m^inute 49), J[uli[an Turl (minute 6{1) and Heinz Linnemann (minu"te 69) all failed.
A ha#nd pen%a%lty - Louis Kortenjann h`ad rescued o,n the goal line w;i;th the hand and got the red card - was also not of us^e for t*he guests (minute 75).

Football: Kreisliga A2 Münster: Spectacular football i%n Albachten: GW Albe\rslo\h falls agai>nst Concordia 3[-[4
I do not know what t/o thin\k of tha&t, he struggled for words.
W[e did no-t ge^t an|y access to them . With ‘ them ’, he allegedly m#ean#t the wing players Colby McGill and Janis Krö.ge.r, but probably also all th/e other gre)en and whit$es, who made themselves not"i"ce"able with their collective offensive urge.
He could still laugh: "A f_ilt_hy wi=n," he said, winking cheekily and the:n went of,f . His p`lay`ers, on the other h!and, we[re relieved to h:ave gotten away with three points.
Mind y.ou, after a duel b.etwe.e.n two teams, on[e of which, Albachten, plays for the c}h}ampio}n}ship and the othe;r, Albersloh, is fighting for staying i,n the lea;gu;e.
W)i)th understandably mixed fee~lin~g~s, GWA coach S-ven Lewandowski looked back at the 90 minute's.
That w\as b&y far our best performance of the season, he sa%ys.
It was phenomenal how we come b+ack from the 0-2 draw a>nd h)eld up against one of the leag)ue's t~op teams over t]h]e entire match.
Hence, the more bitte@r it seems, t+hat they h-ad to go ho,me empty-handed.
Top scorer Lars Zy&mner s<ho<t his team in the l*e*ad with his 12th . Goal this s#eason (minute 2{4).
He ne{e{d{ed exactly two touches i-n t!his game for this goal.
The 2-0, he set fo>r Fab:i:an Fröhning (mi"nut"e 39).
We knew it, but y@ou just ca n~'~t com@pletely take out a player l'ike that.
It was amaz,ing what h)e di+d, Lewandowski ungrudingly recognized th^e opponent ’ s quality.
Jus=t before s+witching sides, his own team ma'nage'd to score the equalizer: McGill ’ s free k|ick from the left side sailed between Hövelmann an{d Concordia go[alkeeper Hinker|ohe in]to the long goal corner (45th minute).
After switching si.de.s, it wa"s McGill again who scored th(e equa@l@izer (59th minute).
And then it wen.t ba^ck and forth.
It wa@s a cr)i)sp, action-packed game.
Nübel shocked Albachten (minut,e 64), j&us&t five minutes later Pa_trick Horstmann e)q)ualiz)ed ag=a=in (minute 69).
Despite their n]umer]ical advantage, Albersloh was unabl'e to coun:ter the last Concordia goal (minut(e 80).
Now, w$e must focus o&n Wednesday.
The game against Schapd/etten, t$hat ’ s o>n>e w{e have to win now, said Lewandowski.
Albersloh: Spangenberg - He;cker, S=tro=hb=ücke=r, Adolph, Zur Mühlen - Kr-ö-ger (87)th m?i?nute Diallo), P. Ho[rstman[n, Thale, McGi>ll - Hövelmann, Bonse (87th mi+nut+e Bareksai).

Satirical revue: Gender communication from the h+eart - Wo,lb,e,ck - Westfälische Nac|h|ri|cht|e|n
Tina Teubner ’ s satirical revue Friday evening i_n t{he hall of t{he Christus+kirche in Wolbeck was "s@uitab@le for adults as well as m+en".
Comedia/n Teubner honed in o_n gender communication with humor a;nd empathy for t]he (stereotypical) woman and the (st,e,reo,typical) man - and anything els|e that out there - b@ut als\o with music.
They played mini guitar and a~ls~o mastered t#heir violins.
Ben S)üv)erkrü)p was manning the p;iano.
On t"he on{e hand, he i`s the male sparring partner, who sometimes eve!n gets a word i;n before the end o?f the sente!n!ce, and o<n the other, a true pian$ist: Süverkrüp accompanied Teubner conge+nial+ly and in harmony, so much so that some m?ay have wished a solo.
T=h=e=n there was this, with Beethoven an`d Cho"pin, but di|ff|erent, so as to fit th:e theme of the evening.
T<eub<n<er had introduced a paradox: She mused th'at a man is h~app~y w~h~en he has a partner but does not hold the d:oor open for h=er.
But that a closed d}oor with)out a partner, on th{e other hand, offers no ben:e:fi:t.
The piano solo de*monstrated this very no'tio'n: Ho$w wo/uld Mozart ’ s career as a composer tur{ned out, if his older sister `/` the Nannerl" ha@d suddenly opened the door?
Thus Sü;v;erkr;üp s.l.ides into im:provisations, f$rom Bach ’ s "O H[ead full o#f blood and wounds" into the "Death Rattle" Western them&e, and fro`m Mozart ’ s G minor Symphony into a playful littl~e dance.
There w,as great applause and shouts of "b~ravo" fro"m the packed hall.
T-he association ’ s tr?easu?rer, Karlheinz Kleintje, presented f^l^owers to the singer.
B;u;t chairwoman Heidemarie Markenbeck refused t~o p+art without offering additional thanks.
She had the i)de)a to trea&t the duo t|o a gig in Wol;b;e;ck in a+ddition to their appearances in Stuttgart and Frankfurt.

O)n October 18th (Thursday) at 19:]30, th\e Heimatverein Nottuln a`lrea`dy hosts hi=s fift=h Nottulner Folktreff in the fireplace room of the old Amtmannei.
I,t ’ s almost exactly a year to the day since w)e met he$re for a Folk Festival for th)e first ti,me.
This eve.nt has n_ow be,come a fixture i(n the mus_ical event calendar in Nottuln, ” says Hann)s Moormann, chairman of the Nottuln Home Association, pleased.
I w]ould not ha}ve th]ough]t that our Folktreff got established so quickly in Nottuln.
Whether it was the s.torm Friederike i-n J/anuary or the heat wave in Ju(l(y, the firep~la~c~e room of the ‘ Amtmannei ’ was al!ways full.
As always, t;he program fo!r the next Folk Festival is a colorf%u%l mix of German folk, hiking a[n[d sai#lor songs, evergr,e,en,s an ol{d hits, says Karl-Heinz Stevermüer, who is al^ways inviting musical fr,ie,nds to Nottuln.

Fro#m clean fruit to ecology
The 125,th anniversary of the District Assoc;ia;ti;on for Gardening and Landscape Conservation wa's ce/lebrated w/it/h a gala at the Dr.-Stammberger-Halle.
On September 29 1893 a fruit show in the Kulmbach community hall set the last impulses for the founding of t|he Kreisverband für Gartenbau un)d Landespflege Kulmbach (District Association for Ga:r:deni:ng and Landscape Co]ns]e]rvati]o]n K,ulmb,ach), a,nd exactly 125 years late'r, o!n Saturday night, the asso,ciat,i,on ce-lebrated the big anniversary i;n the Kulmbach Stadthall(e (civ)ic centre).
Fra.nk.ly th(e association had a different nam!e a\t that time: In the year 1$89$3 the mayor Wilhelm Flessa ammounced th=e name as "Bezirksobstbauverein Kulmbach Stadt und Land" (Di;s;trict Fruit Gr,owing Association Kulmbach City a;nd Country).
The purpose o\f the fruit-g{rowin{g association differed f<ro<m that of today ’ s wo)r)k - in fact, i$t wa^s pur}ely about fruit growing and nobody thought about flowers and gardening at that time.
At that time, i@n t)he era o/f the Enligh-tenment, the f+rui+t tree was a favorite child o)f the elite, explained th>e local history curator Günter Dippold in his speech.
Fru:it trees lined t]he highways, so-called industrial gardens were create-d at schools.
Today fruit cultivation is still the t|ask of the 5.5 gardening clubs in the dis(tr(i(ct of Kulmbach, which include almost 7 0]00 mem,bers.
Bu+t by far t{ha{t i"s not the end of the scope.
Gardening clos;e to nature, biological crop protection, vi@llage beautification and nutrition p-lay just as important a role as does communicating kno(wledge about he|althy diets and youth wo&rk.
The members of th{e Hutsc`hdor`f youth gr,o,up "Maulwürfe '`' (moles) showed entertainingly o<n sta%ge how versatile the tasks of a gardening club are.
Youth work i\s crit;i;cally important, especially i-n the digital age, said Gün/t/er R*eif, chairman o`f the district council, and the lord mayor Henry Schramm also emphasised how important experiences i*n na<ture are for life.
Collecting chestnuts was for us a&s children a huge thing, I do/ubt that wi|th Smar[tphone & Co. it is pos\si\ble to collect a similar qu)antity of joy.
Schramm promised to plant two trees f<or t{he a[nniv[e[r[sar[y w<i<th district administrator Klaus Peter Söllner.
Where th_e t,r,ees will b>e planted will be dec:ide:d by the district association, added district administrator Söllner and emphasised the s`pecia`l importance of the gardening a?ssoc?iat?ions for t@he villages.
The district association stands for ecology, the beaut#y o_f the g#arden and g\ree\n spaces in the village.
The fact that this is a real conc^ern o^f t-h-e many gardening associations in the district, was also stated wit>hout doubt by the county man\a\ger and consultant Friedh&e&lm H<aun.
He presented the numerous visitors a*n illustrated lecture about the long history o~f the district association a~nd reported among oth>er things, how necessary se%lf-suffi%ci%ency was a/fte/r the war.
I*n the old da$ys everything came from th_e garden, for the winter conserves wer+e made.
At the end o=f the 50's, t#he kitchen garden was transformed into an ornamental and live-}i}n garden.
Nature endures, it existed b~efore u{s and we mu%st adapt ourselves to i:t, pleaded the specialist in fruit and n|ut trees.
There is a>n in}cen}tive therefore for t|h|e garde}ning associations not to give up, so that our country remains beautiful a)nd worth living.
Also in@volved is the welcoming of new citizens t!o o|u|r associations, explained the President of t@he Bavarian Association, Wol|fram Vaitl.
We must stop the blatant decline in insects, we owe i)t t(o our children and grandchild+ren, Günter Reif concluded the successful ceremony, whic`h was festively framed by the tower br*ass musicians of th`e Thur#nau mu&si&c association.

Canada ’ s foreign min_ister is now giving trading agreements abs#olute priority - and i]s delaying her speech f\or t=h=e United Nations.
Due to the time pressure invol{ved in the struggle for a ne*w edition of the N'or'th American free trade agreement (Nafta) with th:e USA an'd Mexico, th!e Canadian foreign minister C]hrys]tia Freeland has postponed her speech at the U}N general debate in Ne}w Y\ork.
Instead of today, Sat&urda&y, the mi@n@ister will not speak before th]e United N(ations genera#l assembly until M@o@nday, shared her spokesperson Adam Austen.
In t.h.e meantime she will con:ce:nt:r:ate on the renegot?iation of Nafta.
On Friday th~e Mexican Economy Minister Ildefonso G\uaj\ard\o explained th`at Cana}da and th~e USA had 48 hour[s to agree if Canada re(al(ly wanted to join the trade agreement that had already b&een made between his country and the USA.
In August the USA and Mexico agreed o/n a new version o+f the regional Nafta fre`e trade agreemen=t.
US President Donald Trump ind|icated that Canada could be excluded from Naf~ta i<n future.
The talks concerning revision have be#en o$ngoi$n$g for ov~er a year.
They will have conclu"ded b;y Sunday eve+ning (local t{ime) and Trump ’ s government w=ill sub#mit the agreement to the US Senate before October 1.

The politician had been att~a~c~k~e~d on the s#treet in early September during an elec#tion campaign in southern B&raz&i&l.
Meanwhile, i"n several Brazilian cities, thou%s%ands o,f people took to t!h!e streets to demonstrate against Bolsonaro.
Under t@he title `<` Ele não '[' (English: "Not him"), especi?a?ll?y women's associations p:ro:tested against the ex-military.
The associations also to;o;k to soci'al media t>o protest against Bolsonaro's racist and misogynist stateme<n<t<s.
Several thousand demonstrators were expected i$n t:he economic hub Sã$o Paulo.
I.n th<e capital of Brasili~a, pro[te[sts mixed with a rally of the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Worker]s ’ Part^y (PT), Fernando Haddad.
He took the position of former president Inácio Lula d>a Silva, who had b|ee|n sentenced to tw-e-lve years i[n prison d-ue t.o corruption and therefore cannot stand f}or the presidency.
Th}e presidential election i#n Brazil will b[e on October 7.
As the former m.ayor of the megacity of Sã:o Paulo, H"add"ad has so fa|r been be$hind the extreme right candidate Bolsonaro a&ccording to polls.
The “ Trump o|f Brazil ” ha-s b&ee&n in politics for a long ti_me, but only r,ece,ntly has presented himself as a`n anti-system candidate.
If n-one of t=h=e candidates reach absolute majority in the first round, the&r&e will be a runoff electi?on on October 28`th.
Experts assu+me th\at Bolsonaro will not be victorious - no matter who h,e i<s up against.
Bolsonaro is known fo&r being against g#ay and bla#ck people and for glorif'y'ing the military dictatorship (1964-1985).
He shock]s th.e people of Brazil with verb.al derailments over and over again.
On|ce he said that the su@p@porters of Lula '\s left-wing Labor Party should be sho#t dead.

Following a lo.ng illness: Da"nish rock legend died
The Da@nis@h rock i$con Kim Larsen is dead.
T\he s#inger died on Sunday a.t th$e age of 72 following a long illness, shared his p%rodu%cer Jörn Jeppesen on Larse-n ’ s website.
Larsen w$as surrounded on his deathbed b,y his wife and si_x children.
Since the beginning of th<e year the m:usi:cian h(ad been und=e=r treatment for prostate cancer.
L&ars&e&n became f|am|o|us with the band Gasolin', which in the 1970s w?as e`normousl`y successful in Scandinavia.
Th)eir songs were influen:ce:d by music g~re~a~t~s s]uch as Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan and the Beatles.
In 197)8, a%fter the dissolution of the band, Larsen was s"uc"ce"ss"ful as a s|olo artist.
H|e sold about three million records in D`enmar`k.
H-is album `?` Midt om natten" from 1983 is s]til]l the be^st-s^e^ll^in^g album in Denmark.
The D|anish Prime Minister Lars Lökke Rasmussen paid tribute to Larsen o*n Sunday as a "s(treet boy ':' who w"as `]` against everything, but in everyone ’ s hearts . '`'
Th?e head o;f government also recalled that in the year 2010 the monarchy opponent Larsen performe>d on the occasio/n o-f the 70th birthday of the Danish Queen Margrethe I^I.
A n&ight of rock i=n the shoe fact{ory: Loud as a jackhammer
Here we stand, tak$in$g the bone saw and igniting a concert evening with the strength of a tiger . The ban*d names He.re We Sta?nd, Tiger Bonesaw and The Ignition alone suggest such a description of the rock#in#g live music ev`ent on Saturday evening i<n t_he hall of the Bürgerzentrum Schuhfabrik, the co.m.munity center housed i/n a`n old shoe factory: Pur;e hard ro'ck brought to you b}y three bands who ar:e al?so friends.
After the soundcheck and shortly bef[o[re the st=art of the conc]ert, the music,ians t?ake time for a group photo.
The$re is no hint of stage fr]ight i?n the process.
Afterwards, the lead singers and their b(a(nd(s from A*hle*n a#nd the surrounding area - all of them associated with the Mosquito booking age,n,cy from Oelde - visibly enthrall t.he approximately 120 visitors o[f the Mint Mosquito r%oc%k night wi%th their lou!d performances.
Kicking th}ing}s off, t;he Tiger Bonesaw quartet around frontma%n an}d guitarist Dennis Hadrika manages to win the crowd with their latest, unknown pieces, which t}he ba`nd penned themselves fo^r their soon to be released C}D.
I\n front of th'e stage, people dan/ce to the powerful ye/t harmonious band performance.
Despite lou$d calls for an encore, Tiger Bones<a<w then h,and over t:he reigns t^o the three-member Here We Stand.
Guitarist Sascha Bregenhor<n, G>olo Meierhenrich on bass, and drummer Kai Hölscher demonstrate the variety withi]n hard ro!c!k with t%h%eir alternative sound, which i:s so&metime&s reminiscent of 1970s classic rock.
Following th"e hi*gh energy rock of t{h{e Tigers, Here We Stand adds a synthesizer on top o.f the guitar so[und.
Among other titl\es, the yearning, almost ballad-like Ta{ke Me H@o@me captivates th:e a:ud:ience by switching betwee^n melodic passages and the g;uitar-hea;v;y rock reefs typical of the multi-layered songs.
Meanwhile, the quartet The Ignition f^rom Tönnishäuschen have earn[ed a special rep>uta>ti>o>n since the band formed i'n 2005.
The band presented their full-e+n+erg+y hard rock on Satur?day.
I&t is obvious and unmistakabl'e that The Ignition have a g"reat deal of stage experience from their performances in front of v>e>ry large aud'iences - recently documented i_n a film by Max Meis abou,t the 20;17 China tour.
Pl-a-ying off his band, S.inge.r an|d guitarist Tim Jungmann ha>s his very ow_n take on the eveni!ng ’ s only cover - Word Up by Cameo from t{h{e 80s.
Meanwhile, i-t f{eel{s like the volume is dial?ed up even higher tha}n before as guitarist Norbert Brinkmann del=iver=s a solo while running through the ch`eering crowd.
O,f course, when it comes to hard rock concerts, a certain decibel level has to b]e expect}ed: Acco,rdin,g to th'e sound crew, t}hat level was aro$u$nd 9>8 decibels for the three band concert wi?th Here We Stand, Tig)er Bonesaw, a~nd The Ignition during the Mint Mosquito ni:ght of rock.
That is approximately the sa(me le/vel a}s a jack:h:am:m:er, which is still signi(fic(antly lower than the peak volumes at Wacken Open Air fest~iva~l referenced on the band website of Th;e Ignition.
However, the Ahlen audience h*as n+o need during this night of r^ock for 120 deci&bel so|u|n|d a*s loud as a jet e$ng$ine, as is common at the heavy metal get toge~th~er in the north of Germany.
After ju"s"t under four hours, th|e three hard rock ba^n^ds have long since w:on the audience over wit}h their confident, expert performance a=nd own songs.
In the end, a/ll three bands can honestly, if figuratively, say: "Here we st~a~nd, having taken the bone s|aw and ignited a con>c>ert e,ve,ning w.ith the strength o<f a ti}ger."
Above all, they enjoyed the ple'n't'if'ul applau'se fr-om the audience.

Trump adores Kim: `/` And then w`e fell in love '~'
It is n=o secret that the US President is well disposed tow!ar!ds Nor`th Korea ’ s ruler Kim, des)pite the n-uclear crisis.
Now Trump h.as made a real declaration of love to hi;s co}l}league.
This is als)o linked t@o Kim ’ s ‘ won!derfu!l letters ’.
At the tender age of 72 ye`ars, t"he m&arried US president h\as a new flame.
T/h/e tragic thing is: I*t i-s a long-distance relationship.
On Saturday, i)n total publi/c, Donald Trump made a_n unusual declaration of love to the North K;orean le>a>der Kim Jong Un.
Supporters in the US federal state of West V[irgin[ia have heard tende^r words from Trump for the descendant from th{e ruling dy*nasty of Pyongyang half his age, alth<ough the struggle for North K(orea ’ s nuclear disarmam[ent i`s proving to be a part|icularly t!ough job.
I was tough and so wa~s he, i+t went backwa!rds and forwards between u_s, reported Trump.
The\n w(e fell in love.
O.K?
N[o, really.
And not only th^e conversations with Kim h)a)d brought his he|a|rt to melt.
He wrot<e me beautiful letters, t|h|ey we?re great letters.
Their personal conn%e%ctio%n also bore fruit pol"iti"ca"ll"y: T{rump po\inted to Kim ’ s announced to halt al(l nuclear an-d missile tes;t;s, even though critics say it is mere cheap talk.
T^he US p_resident seemed to be fully aware, that not everyone was fond of t{he a)ffection for th,e notorious martial thr{eats of the "R)ocket Ma_n" - so Trump ’ s nickname for Kim.
He accepted th`e expected criticism during his appearance at a large sp,orts hall in the city of Wheeling: ‘ Donald Tr#u#mp sa(ys, the$y have fallen i)n l{ove ’.
How terribl.e, ho_w terrible is this?
T'hat is so unpresidential.
H^e cared l)i)ttle f{or that, said T=rump, pointing his finger at the crowd: "I always told you, it is so easy t{o b\e presidential . ')'
But 10,000 pe}o}ple out<side would n]o]t be surging int{o this packed arena, we would only have 200 pe|o|ple standing outside.

Thanks to vid'eo from Libyan prison, refugees are re[scued
Nigerian refugees have used a mobile video to p@oint out t~hei~r catastrophic co{ndi{tions in Libya wh'ich h"as made it possible for them to be res*cue*d.
At the risk of t_he_ir lives, the group had shot t<h<e video in thei+r cell i;n the coastal to#wn of Sawija in Jul:y and spread it online.
They refuse to s)end us b\ack, said a man i$n the video message.
W|e are suffering here . We ar=e dying here.
The rec[ording w]as sent to the website “ France 2@4 Observers, ” whose edito.rs alerted t{h{e International Organization for Migration (IOM).
The refugees w\e\re ulti~mate~l~y flown o?ut to Nigeria at the end of August.
Without t[he video, w|e likely would not have been able t;o return to Nigeria, said Efe Onyeka, who made the video, acc}o}rdin}g t%o th}e news ag$ency AFP.
The 25-\yea\r old was arrested in Libya when a.ttemp.ting to make her w!a!y into Europe v&i&a the Mediterranean.
Wi@t@h t?he video, h!e said he risked his own life.
One of h:i:s companions was almost beaten to de'a'th by guards, said Ony[ek[a.
In gene'ral, the c,onditions in jail were catastrophic; “ T}hey beat all o<f us with pipes and st)ick)s . ”
They d}idn't give us anything to e~at . W?e had to drink out of the lat)ri)ne.
The IOM org]anized the voluntary repatriation of the refuge-es who were s@t@ran@ded in Libya.
Ab}out 2,700 migrants from Nigeria have b)een sent back to their home in the Wes&t African country this year with t'he help of th@e program, s'aid th~e IOM spokesperson Jorge Galindo.
Given the poor conditions in Liby{a, thi{s case of t.h.e n-ow rescued Nigerians is no exception.
However, a ca}l}l for he{lp via mobile phone vi'deo was new to them.
Internationa?l organizations ar+e criticizing the conditions i-n the Libyan refugee camps as inhumane.
The North African country, which is lar:gel:y controlled b=y milit?ia?s, is the main country o#f passage for migrants on t%heir way from Africa to E+u+rope.

A German was trapped in h%i%s au]tomobile for days
A 75 ye'ar old ma_n had to endure several d@a@ys and nights in his ca^r i[n a forested a)rea in Middle Franconia, a$fter his car got stuck away from all for;est roads and a t"ree blocked the car door.
On Saturday afternoon rescue workers ac/cidentally discovered the ca$r near a meadow and fre=ed the pers.o.n considered missing since Tuesday evening, t-h-e police said on Sunda.y.
The 7&5-y&ea&r-o&ld fr`om Pleinfeld was apparently found in a healthy co?ndi?tions despite the cold nights a}nd lon(g period without supplies.
He said he is no}w pleased t"o be home.
The pensioner ha\d been r)eported missing by his family, when on Tuesday he d[id not return from a jou'rney in his S%U%V across local grassla.nd and fields.

L#asche#t urges T&urkey to act according to the rule of la+w
Cologne - According to the Minister President of N:RW Armin Laschet (CDU), during his ta>lks with Turkish President Rec\ep Tayyip Erdogan, c&alled f{or t"he rule o`f law in Turkey.
The relationships of both countries are current'ly ‘ o?vers?hadowed ’, Laschet said on Saturday, follo]wing a meeting w)ith Erdogan at Cologne a'irp'ort.
These concerns are r+e+lated to all th^e arrest waves, freedom of m;edia a\nd religion.
He th-eref-ore m'ade i-t clear to Erdogan that "if in the fut_u_re relations are going to become normal and if economic r#el#ations are goin)g to deepen, then the rule of law i^s a very important con{di{tion."
Acco$rd$in$g to Laschet, h?e also r<e<ferred to the cas&es of Germans being imprisoned in Turkey.
He had expressed the hope t]h]at freedom o{f expr.ession would be respected.
The[reupon Erdogan once again un%d%erlined the independence of Turkish system o#f justice.
The conversation between L{a{schet an(d Erdogan h{ad bee/n transferred to the building of t_he Executive Transport Wing of the Federal Ministry of Defence at Col)ogne Airport.
Or{iginal{ly it should have ta{k{en place at W%ahn castle - b*u*t the castle owners declined due to political v'ie'ws against Erdogan.
Af:t:er the speech Erdogan went to t_he opening of the Ditib Mosque in Colo(gn(e.
Lasch!e!t declined a joint appearance in the buildi$n$g.
H?e did say t!hough: ‘ The Muslim?s who go to this mosque, are al|so citizens of ou#r country ’.
And we are their contact persons - a\nd not the T?urki?sh pre@sid@en@t.
Lack of trust i!n the US: No[rth Korea dema(nds disarmament
While U+S Pre?sid?ent, Trump does not tire of highlighting t#he success of negotiations over North Kor/ea ’ s denuclearization, t.he Eas)t Asian regime is describing relations more demu^rely.
Foreign Minister Ri calls for a concess_i_on from Washi^n^gton.
North Korea ’ s Fore"ign Mini^st^er Ri Yong H[o, speaking at the UN General Debate, ha)s accus{ed th[e US government of stalling negotiations for a nuclear-free Korean peninsula through con?tinued sanctions.
The recent standstill has s@een t&he U;S implementing coerc+i+ve measures, which are lethal t>o trust-building, said Ri in New York.
Disarmament under these circ}umstance would be unthinkable fo<r Nor:t:h Korea.
Without any trust in th:e U=S, there i;s no trust in our national security and u#nder such circumstances there is no way tha(t we can disarm ourselves f~i~rs~t, th{e North Korean head di{plomat said.
The idea that Nor=th Kor-e-a could b"e ‘ brought t)o its knees ’ due to the sanctions, is ‘ a pip*e dream of people w+h+o d-on ’ t know us ’.
To b_uild trust his country has st:opped its atom and missi@le tests an!d has destroyed a nuclear test s\ystem, Ri said.
However, t^he USA ha]s shown n'o "corresponding reactions" to that, the minister cr=iticised.
Last year al!one, because of No>rth Korea ’ s nuclear a.nd missile pr#og#ra#m, the UN Security Council passed sanctions on th}e internationally isolated cou}ntr}y three times.
In recent days the US Pr~esident Donald Trump and h%is Secretary of Stat/e Mike Pompeo have been pushi!ng for strict adherence to the sanctio}ns a#t the United Nations.
Con.cur.rentl.y, the US government i!s working o+n a rapprochement.
In Ju^ne, Trump first met w#i#th North Korea ’ s ru]ler, Kim Jo$ng Un.
After the first s-umm-it in S_in_g_ap_or_e t-he US President is aiming for a second summit meeting with Ki#m.
In October, Pompeo will b#e tr:ave:ling to Pyongyang again for talks about the termination of th}e North Korean nuclear weap}ons prog]ra]m.
The HoT served: N`ew kitch&en with donations from the co*mm*unity
The many v@isitors of the House of the Open Door (HoT) d{idn ’ t r?eal?ise the fact that they were actually in a youth c<lu<b: White blankets an'd floral decorations on the tables an\d a large buffet wer^e wait?in?g for the gu_ests after the T[h[anksgi[vi[ng service.
Youth from the HoT had conjured up t`h`e buffet with deli~c~acies from different cou`ntries in the new ki$tch$en.
The facility was financed by donations from the community, for which the y&o&uth wanted t%o expr-es-s their thanks wi!t!h th}e meal.
The start w+a+s not ea@s@y, as Henriette Westbuer, he:ad o$f the HoT, remembers.
We had already filled our refrigerators with f*ood a|nd ingredients bef#ore the summer break, and w"e were well prepared for th)e big day.
But t^h^en the bad surprise came on the first day after the summer bre?ak: A power out`ag`e had cut the power t+o the huge two-part refr{igera{tor, the food was spoiled an.d ha*d to b+e thrown out.
Now we had to start from the beginn?in?g ag}a}in: W?e got a lot of support from friends a;nd ne?i?ghbors, but the children a&nd youth wanted to d.o it alone, says Westbuer.
And so ev`eryone helped.
The re]su]lt was impressive and the guest_s were excited.
Professional chefs coul-d not d(o any better either, an impressed visitor said, while H\okka\ido pumpkin so~up was served and the g<ue<s<t<s enjoyed quiche, meatloaf o}r cake.
It is r.e.ally great what the children and y-oung p^e^ople have pu~t together, said pastor Frank Beckmann, while mag~icia~n Stephan Lammen a?mazed the guests with card t*r*ic*ks and other performances.
J%ürg%en Sator leaves the NRW executive b]oard of the Tafel
Out o=f frustratio|n o|v|er criticism from their own ranks, the head of the Essen Tafel, Jörg Sarto}r, has give@n up his posi=tion.
Sar#tor had become known nationwide bec`ause the E[s[sen T/afel had introduced a limit for foreigners.
He h)a)d resigned in July a_s vice-chairman of th.e NRW Tafel, said Sartor to t'he `_` Welt am Sonntag".
To^o many had stabbed m,e in the back.
The he+ad of t`he NRW association of the Tafel, Wol%fgang Weilerswist, e|xpres|sed understanding for the decision of his longtime dep?ut?y to dpa.
Sartor to>ok the sha;rp criticism to heart.
I c+an unders"ta"nd his step - ma]ny people spoke u{p wh?o did not even know exactly why the Essen Tafel does that.
But Sartor is sti$ll working for the Essener Tafel - “ six days a week, noth-ing h{as changed abou-t it, ” s?a?ys We$ile$rswist.
Sartor criticized colleagues f#r#om other Taf\el associations in "Welt am Sonntag . `>`.
O|ne should not think, "that without us, peop.le in the city wou_ld b<e starving."
It would b<e the go@v@ernment ’ s obligation t"o ensure that people did not starve t'o death.
The man f%rom Essen did not partic:ipate at a congress o<f the Tafel in Berlin o,n Friday.
They ’ r>e oversimplifying it all, he s~aid.
There a"re all those do-gooders who criticized m?e so much back th]en.

No'w, the team of Domenico Tedesco again sh{owed the sa)me strength, whic=h allowed it t[o take the first plac~e behind Bayern last season.
Alessandro Schöpf secu>red the lead of the home team in the eleventh minute aft|er heavy pre+p+a+rato+ry head work by Yevgeny Konoplyanka, as a result o.f which the home team preserve<d th>e mini buffer wit^h a sol}id defensive performance.
Thanks to an extraordi%na%ry comeback B,or,uss,ia Dortmund ar&e moving back up the national le#ague again.
The team o{f Lucien Favre playing against Bayer Leverkusen by half-time had b<rought itself to a 0:2 l#oss, but in th;e second ha)lf came to a 4::2 win.
Jacob-Bruun Larsen (65 .) and Marco Reus (6~9 .) with a doublet within fo(ur minutes broug(ht the gam@e to a tie . Pa;co Alcacer, wh%o was sent t^o the field by Favre in th&e 63rd minute as a substitute, pro\vi\ded another doublet in the closing s(ta(g(e(s o[f the cam}e (86{./{94 .) a>s the crowning conclusion of the performance i<ncrea<s<e after the break.
The V/fB Stuttgart a?l?so received its first victory.
The Stuttgarters had t=o take fear of the Werde:r Bremen, which al~re~ady before t(he end of the first ha#lf-t#ime h!ad been reduced to a te]am of ten because o(f a yellow-red card against Milos Veljkovic.
Borna Sosa and t<he inattentive goalie Ron-Rob(ert Zieler fabricated a strange throw-in own goal, which help&d the guests tie t&h&e ga|me in the 68t*h minute.
Seven minutes later Gonzalo Castro led the Vf|B t=o its first w!in.
Michael L*ang playing in Wolfs-burg, did no+t experience a completely successful, b?ut neither a failed debut for B:orus:sia Mönchengladbach.
The Gladbachers, using the Swiss quartet$t line-up of Yann Sommer, Nico Elvedi, Denis Zakari.a and Lang gave away th>e lead twice, b}ut u;lti;mately achieved a 2:2 score, which means t$h$at since t(he year 20_0_3 they still await an away win in t*h*e V"W city.
Renato S{te{ffe{n was re`sp`onsibl`e for the 1:1 tie goal for Wolfsburg, which was h"is seco?nd goa+l in the Bundesliga.
The Aargauer Yann Sommer w.as powe(rle(ss ag?ain?st the l;ow shot from 20 metres, a:s well as a;gainst the second goal against an hour later.

Th*e 55-year-old Kahrs speaks on budg%etary po,licy for t;h;e SPD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag and is one of th<e Seeheim region speakers of the conservative SPD win`g.
Kahrs had caused quite a stir wit|h a;n angry spe@e@ch o;n Jun%e 3"0, 2017 during a parliamentary debate over allowing homosexuals to get married.
For example, he a`ccused Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) of having `^` stu^mbled" on the subj,ect.

The fall of Hertha: Overtaken by rea'l'ity: Bayern ca-l-ls for Aj'ax
The title o<f un;b;eat;able is g[one: The defeat in Berlin will no\t allow t#he FC Bayern to give up.
The n/ext two classics against Ajax a>nd Gladbach will now determine t`h`e inter[i[m concl'usi'on for Niko Kovac ’ s tenure.
Under no circumstances should the first sm>all drop in power with t_h_e new coach Ni[ko Kovaca s/h/ould increase for Munich to t]he autumn minimum.
A w|eek ago, everyone still thought we w!ere unbeat-able.
Now we are overtaken by realit_y, said Tho|mas Müller after the 0-2 defeat of Hertha BSC and asks fo_r a return leg i'n the Champions League d*u*el w{i{t{h Ajax Amsterda>m.
Anyone w"ho knows u%s, i_s aware that we are really angry and t(hat is why we will crank u)p on Tuesday.
For the first time w@ithin more than a year of playing aw`a`y there were sco=r=e=d no goals, as at the same time two man@datory preseason games in ser}ies wit_hout a victory, t/he lea)gue leaders in t/he Bundesliga lost to Borussia Dortmund.
The ov\e\ral\l situation is not nearly as dramatic as the final phase of the fai$l$ed Carlo An/ce/lotti at th;e end of September 201"7, bu_t th(e champions shall be aware.
The FC Augsburg with the 1:1 ra"tio having its long running man-on-man tactics and the Berlin through it*s playful pin$pricks ov?er the o&u&tside have delivered within t\w\o days t%wo similar blueprints, a>s t-h-e last overpowering appearing of Bayern failed.
Those who know Bayern ar[e aware that we will not put u\p with that and that w>e wi]ll do everything t$o become successful ag!ai!n, Kovac said.
Apart fro.m this, he quietly bypassed hi}s native city with his lo.ser.s and put his first defeat as Munich coach dow\n to the in!ad!equate handling of opp.o.rt.u.nities.
A win over Amsterdam and Borussia M^onch^en^glad^bach on Saturday would ma/ke t;he fir*st preliminary conclusion of his term being positive before the international break - otherwise t:he tone w&i&ll pr)obably get worse.
So before the se#cond premier class appearance in th<is season after the 2-0 over Be/nfic/a Lisbon, Kovac u?ndertook n,o extraordinary measures.
As it w}as planned, after th<e day of-f on Sunday started quick preparation for t\he second preliminary round match ag_ainst Aj@ax, who beat AEK Athens confidently 3-0 as w~el~l.
Now t*h*e*y ’ v|e scored a victory over u-s in two games, but w<e w.ill also reach our goals again, announc'ed captain of the national team Manuel Neue!r.
Alre{a{d{y after the lost cup final a"g"ai"n"st Eintracht Frankfurt, at the same position t'h'e most notably in p<lain text spoke J+o+shua Kimmich.
T|he right defender take on the rol=e of admonisher.
I do no't believe th\a\t this is all ba"d luck, we n@eed to work i~t out again, because we d<o not go for most of the oppo\r\tunities and ma/ke mistakes, said the 23-year-old shortly befor^e leaving the Olympic stadium.
On the sev{en{th match day of the previous season Bayern was eve'n five poi_nts behind Dortmund, which ha;s now tak]e]n over with o;n;e point ahead.
An?d so Kimmich a.ppreciat.ed only with a shrug of its shoulders at least positively, th.at n*ow the public de+bate about supposedly invincible Bavaria has end#e#d.
Yes, th[at ’ s g_ood, said t{he national player.
It is a good thing fo[r t)he league.
DFB boss comes under f%ire: Özil-Causa: S!ha!rp attack o?f Erdogan on Grindel
The Turkish p$re$side$nt Erdogan condemns the exclusion of Mesut Özil and Ilk#ay Gündogan i#n Germany amidst serious ac#cus#at#i#ons.
The DFB presi+dent Grindel admits mistakes bu\t upholds the a[ss[oc[iation ’ s line.
N;ow will be created a new po>st.
Ber,lin - Recep Tayyi!p Erdogan a>nd Reinhard Grindel fought on different stages fo'r interpretation i}n the lengthy Mesut Özil dispute.
A[fter the Turkish P^r^esident criticized th=e speech of the former wo@r@ld champion i.n Germany at the opening o:f large Ditib Mosque in Cologne, t^he head of DFB upheld the association ’ s line.
Early o>n Sunday morning, Grindl, who ha&d b,een personally attacked by Özil, reported o/n th}e c>onseque>nc>e>s of the i:ssue on the Mainz ZDF “ Sport studio ”.
As we have a l*ot o)f players with a migration background in th;e U t~e~ams, in future we mus)t draw very s?pec?ific conclusions, so something like thi=s this does not happen again, said the 5*7-year-old and plans to get a national p]l]a]yer without a migr%ation background as an additional int>egr>ation official.
Grindel also expl'a'ined again that E|r|d|ogan does not stand for the values of football and t.he DF*B.
The la=tter was very cr<i<tical of the racism against Özi(l and Ilkay Gündogan.
Our Mesut Özil, born an;d raise,d i;n Germany, and our Ilkay.
They e^xcluded them from t-his association because they allowed me to b*e photographed with them in Englan/d, '$' said Erdogan in Domstadt o_n Saturday.
Frankly speaking, a^s their president, I could not accept t&he fact that our t#wo young m,en, who had been rise$n t#o the German n`ati`onal team, were excluded.
Grindel pointed at Gün%do%gan's statement that in contr>as>t to Özil, after the Wo'r'ld Cup affair, whic%h had been take~n pho!tos of the two with Erdo,ga,n, he f<e<l<t that he was "reasonably treated b[y the DFB".
He als`o said he wa/n/ted to s-tan-d up for players in future.
That thing they sa'y: If I wi<n - I ’ m German, i(f I lo^se - I ’ m a migrant - t>hat will n+ot work.
I a@m very sorry t<hat he had such an impression, sa}id Grindel.
I ’ v@e always s:a:id that we had to defend Mesut mo+re.
Yet he d:o:es not see grounds for Özil to return to t;he national t~eam.
As a consequ-ence, in addition to the na[t[ive Brazili"an Cacau and Ce[lia Sasic of Came@ro@on ancestry, now shoul)d be appointed an additional integration representative.
If somebody without a migration background is an o-bv-i-o-us influencer in society an}d footba#ll and says: The issue is a;n impor't'ant one, we need t.o d[o s<om<ethin<g about it ’, thi@s would als#o be an initiative to provide a better foundation for our local teams, where integration ne;e;ds to work ’, Grinde}l said.
Despite the cr{itici{s{m of h%is person after the World Cu*p and t-he Özil affair, h+e wants to run for the post of DFB President again next y:e:ar.
I do my work and take care I d_o it as we_l_l a}s p]oss]i]b]l]e, Grindel said.

If w;e get m~arri~ed, then right.
He has been w"it"h his partn#er for 25 years.
The 55-year-old Kah&rs is t'he f>iscal pol%icy speaker for the SPD parliamentary group in the German Bundestag and is one of th'e Se~eheim region speakers o`f the conservative SPD wing.
On June 30, 20&17 Kahrs caused a huge stir about the o#pening o'f marriage t?o homosexuals in the Bundestag deb]at]e.

H}e felt this was its Schabowski moment, alluding to t"he i-na-dverte-nt a:nnou:n:ce:m:e:nt of the East German bor.der opening by Günter Schabowski.

Switzerland is starting a,n elec%t%r%onic register for organ donors
T_h_e register should faci{litate organ donations a}nd relieve relatives in stressful situations.
Sw,i,sstranspla,nt em|ph|asi|zes that th-e new process will n.o.t change the way organs are only extracted with express consent.
(dpa) Switzerland sta$r$t$s i(ts electronic register for organ donation this Monda|y.
This should facilitate organ donations and relieve r{elatives i{n s!tress!fu!l situations.
Those who want t$o donate their organs i@n cases o,f death, can regi|ster themselves.
You/r wishes will then b/e available to Swi_sst_ra_nsp_l_an_t, if required.
Swisstransplant emphasizes that the new p+r+o+cess will n@o@t change the way organs are on]ly extracted with express co[nsent, as is t=he case in Germa|ny.
It is as[s[umed that 15 percent of the Swiss ha<ve donor cards, says Franz Im;me;r, Director o!f the S'wiss't'ranspl'an't foundation.
But only i)n fi_ve percent of case[s, a card is found a&t the crucial moment when donating is possi.ble.
In over 6;0 percent of conversations, relatives do not know t]h]e dea!d per.s.on ’ s intentions.
You then hav_e t<o de`cide on behalf o_f the deceased, according to their wish, which is often ve&ry stressful, says Immer.
A similar registration system al%rea%dy exists in Great B\rita\in.
In Germany, the recording of details about possible o~rgan donation on the he_a_lth card ha.s been considered, as stated by the speaker for the Feder}al Of_fice f(or Health Education, Marita Völker(-Albert.
The%re is no register where people can record their wishes, fo{r or against orga"n donation, s$he says.
Federal He}a}lth Minister has spoken about ne+w guidelines fo~r organ donation.
According to h,is suggestion, everyone will b(e considered a_n organ donor, unless he/she o@r relatives contradict this.
Among others, the Catholic Church objec>t>s the prop$osed re|gulation.

Wenzel G^rüß fro:m Lastrup demonstrated how he can kee.p a ball in the ai#r while calculating.
He i=s one o^f seven Germans in the competition.
I?n total, 82 cand"idat"es from more th/an 20 countries, tried to qualify for t,he competition.
Two years ago Grü/ß a's a 14 year o~ld, at the time, was present in Bielefel<d.

In India or Singapore, there are even computing c|o|mp|etitions se?t u?p in stadiums.
Square root extraction fro#m six-digit numbers, for e>xample, is als|o included in t,he disciplines.
In the various calcul,ations, the cand.ida.t.es get surprise tasks, fo)r which they ne%ed to find a solut/i/o/n strategy.
The m%ai%n ju-dg-e said the Germans also had a g,ood chance.

Th_ere_fore, road conditions o"n higher mountain pass roa^ds (Arlberg P[a[ss, Timmelsjoch, Bieler Höh\e, Bre_nner Pass, Gerlos Pass, Felbertauern, Grossglockner High Alpine Road) may b!e wintry.
On Monday farmers are all<owed to start th$e annual hedg#e bank maintainance
On Monda^y Sch~leswig-Hols~tein farmers can start with the annual hedge ba)nk maintainance.
For around 2&0&0 years, the `:` green ramparts" which are unique i?n Germany, h\av\e shaped the landscape o<f the forest-poor state.
The tree and undergrowth h|edges, up t]o five meters w}ide, are ‘ forest replacements ’ a.nd for many an,i,m,als and plants ar:e the last areas of retreat.
Hedge ban~ks connect as cor%r%i%d%o%r%s scattered habitats, through which t)he exc[ha[nge of organisms can still func{tion, as the executive d~ire~cto~r of the Nature An"d Biodiversity Conservation Union (NABU) in Sc>hleswig-H>o>lst>ein, Ingo Ludwichowski, said.
Hed,ge banks are living fences
In th.e ye\ar 1766 the hedge ba]n]ks were created at the command of the Dani-sh King Christian V?I who ruled over Schleswig-Holstein.
The ‘ living fences ’ were not jus+t field boundaries an~d cattle fencing, th#ey also provided farmers with firewood an\d beams for t-h-eir half-timbe?red houses.
From that time comes the nam%e `%` Knick": By "bending over '@' (Umkni/c/k/en) the bran(ch(es, the dense, intertwined boundaries co]uld develop.
To;d;ay, arou]n]d 45 00>0 k_ilome_t_ers of hedgerows stretch between the North Sea and the Baltic Sea, givi+ng the image of a w\oode\d, diversely structured landscape.
According to th)e NA[BU ’ s details they are used by approxi=m=at=el=y 7,000 animal species as a_n alternative habitat.
One kilometre o>f hedge bank may contain up to 1 800 diffe(rent species and up t&o 3)0 pairs of bi;rds may breed there.
The hedge banks can only fulfill the~i~r ec&ologic&al&ly important role if they ar*e m+aint+ained accordingly in the winter.
Otherwise, it i-s stunted t.o a sparse tree line, which causes not only losses i%n biodiver^si^ty b@ut also in the windbreaking effect, said Ludwicho$ws$ki.
The hedge bank main#tenance, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, c_an only ta~ke place outside the breeding p"eriod or fr#om O=c=tob=er until March.
After the tsunami on Sulawesi a>n Indonesian talks a$b$out local situa(tion
Th:e local Radika Pinto descr{ibes the local sit\uat\i\on on Sulawesi island following the e.art.hquakes and tsunami in the interview w'ith RedaktionsNetzwerk Deutschland (R:ND):
Were y/ou on location when th~e tsunami took place?
No, I was in Jakarta o|n Ja:va i$sl$a$nd at the time.
A\t the time of the earthquakes, m_y w:ife called me, she was i<n Palu.
Whe<n I h%e%a%rd about the tsunami, I im[m[ed[iate[ly returned to Sulawesi.
I arrived there on Sunday m:o:rn:in:g, because I still h'ad to drive for more th|an 2.0 hours by ca"r after the flight as the airport at Pa?lu was closed at t?he time.
W=ha=t is the situation on t_he island now?
The national gov?ernment has opened the air\port again, so a\id supply can be f/lown in.
When I arrived, I saw the hou;se;s on th%e coast, whic<h were completely d}estro}yed.
O=ur ‘ World Vision ’ offi*ce is also destroyed, but we ha^ve set something up provisionally, where other peo+p+le have al$so been ac'c'o'mmod'ated.
Whe.r.e are the people of Sulawesi li%vi%ng now?
Many ran to the surrounding hills, where they he$ld out thro(ugh fear of another tsunami and ea&rthquake, a!n!d where there is n=o ac)cess to water and food.
M%any stopped in front of t$he$ir ho:uses with aftershocks still being experienced.
As many food shops and g.as stations are comple.tel.y shut, som<e people a.re stealing provisions and gasoline.
The public s~ervices have completely shut down and the natio,nal governme(nt is helping.
Even a pri,son was destroyed, the prisoners are running around free, an/d searching f"o"r them i\s difficult.
There are still lots of bod-ies lyi>n>g around, many people have no-t been found a,nd are missing.
How i!s the comm[u[nic[a[tion and information flow on th\e island?
At th\e moment we hav*e mobile reception, which did not work previously and we ha{ve been rec(eivi(n(g information via r@adio.
Many pe&ople are still looking for their ch(ildre(n, neighbors and other persons, no}t knowing if they are alive and where they are staying, because people were not at h+ome during th&e earthquake an'd wer=e on the wa%y t]o work, for ex'ample.
Th?e tsunami warning system did n,ot work correctly.
Do you have an!y inf$o$rmation about this?
W&e do n[ot know the re<ason<s for this, but w-hen the all-clear was give[n, many p[e[ople thought ‘ O,K, no tsunami ’, and then it came.
In o(th(er regions not affec)ted by the tsunami, there was false information about a tsunami hitting the region and t$hey ra?n t*o the surrou,nd,ing hills.
A!n island like S#ul#awesi that sits on the Pacific r#im of fire, is not pr;epared for earthquakes?
Yet t\here ar"e earthquakes every day, but this one wa,s the worst.
We normally k}no}w how to react to an eart?h?quake a)nd are trained for evacuations.
But the complete infrastructure has collapsed, the earthquake h&as affect|e|d a lot o{f p;eo;ple.

In the coming w~inter, th>e Saalfeld~e~n n(ative wants to catch up on the missed medal at the world championship in Ö]ste]r]su]nd.
The 31 year old ’ s last shot cost him t)he medal that w{as within his grasp in th%e Olympic spr:int a|t Pyeonchang.

B<re<tt Kavanaugh: H'i'gh-sp'ee'd FBI investigation
Time i}s ex+treme+l+y tight and the num*b*er of planned interrogations is very restricted.
Republicans in the U)S Senate want the break-neck sp;ee;d FBI investigation t)o help secur|e a majority for Supr=eme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, wh*ich has become paper thin a?mid allegations of sexual misconduct.
President Donald Tru`mp has s%e%t a deadline of Friday for i"nvest"i"gators to clarify more t*h*an 30 years of suspected incidents fro>m years back.
The recent turnaround in the drama surrounding Kavanaugh ';s nomina+tion, which has involved a cul~ture war, had bee-n triggered on F>rid>a>y.
After an 8-hour hearing of Kavanaugh and the first accus.er Christine Bla(s(ey Ford, in whi}ch the lawye#r directed angry tirades at the oppo|sit|i|on d!emocrats, the Senate Judiciary Committee wanted to pa@ve the way f&or final confirmation of the ultra-sensitive judge a)t the U>S Supreme Court.
The majority of Re"publica"ns seem=ed assured when Sena#to#r Jef>f Flake, against his original announcement, suddenly declared he would ag.re.e, but demanded an FBI inves*tigation.
Fol}lowing tumultuous scenes his part*y friends agreed.
President Trump, who d|es|cribe|d th'e b`itter arguments on Thursday as a ‘ sc"a"m ’, then in$cl$uded f%u%rt%her attacks against the wom'en and spoke in contrast about a ‘ blessing in disguise ’.
He said that th,is way any lingering d>oubts could be eli*mina*ted.
Later, Trump attacked Democrats sharply a>t a rall"y because th\e\y opposed Kavanaugh: "T*hey t=ry to block and destroy."
Trump is or(d(eri(n(g an FBI investigation i@nt@o the Kavanaugh case
The White House h{as also s*e*ve*rely narrowed the powers o%f the investigators.
They wi,ll focu}s o>n investigating t"h"e known allegations by two women, nothin|g more, a government official to{ld the Wall Street Journal: "T,he,y wi:ll not be going on a fishing trip."
According to th&e ‘ N%ew Y)ork Times ’ only four witnesses will be heard.
As of Monda=y October 1st the mobile radar unit insta"l"l"ed in a "civil vehicle", that keeps w'at'ch ov_er speed limits i_n the borough o)f Ried was located to the Gartenstraße, acc*o*rdi*ng t}o the municipality.
Th"e Federal School Centre is a}lso located there.

F:C Schalke 04 a-fter defeating Mainz: You could feel the f@ear
Tra;in;er Domenico Tedesco and Schalke 04 celebrated the first w#in o}f the s#eason against Mainz.
There is a great se(nse of relief at Schalke after th%e first wi&n of th]e season.
Nevertheless, t_i_me was also a factor a"g"ainst Mainz.
Gelsenkirchen - By now, C(hristian Heid)e)l is wel}l-kn}o}wn for being a huge pessimist at football mat{ches.
The home game agains_t Ma;in;z 05 was no different.
I s<aw eve;ry ball going in.
And there w:ere many corners and many balls in our pena_lty a:rea, said the sp(ort(s di*r*e*cto*r of Schalke 04 - and breathed a sig>h of relief.
After all, t&he "royal blue&s" had managed to seal t!he narrow 1:0 wi@n against Mainz over the c/ourse of the match and thus celebrated the first victory o<f the se]aso]n.
In fact, things could have be?en v^er^y different.
After Ale:ssa:ndro Schöpf (11th) had gi[ven the team o}f hea)d coach Domenico Tedesco the lead a]nd th)erefore secur\ity, Tedesco said: "I#n sum, the fi[rst half was good, both in te)rms of how we played a(n(d in terms of pressing". As the match continued, menta;l strength became increasingly important.
Schöpf i;s usually not an aeria_l threat
The last ten minutes f~elt li*ke two hour>s to me, said Heidel: ‘ I c<an understand i>f the team was o`nly half as nervous as I was on the be^nch ’.
The boys wer~e afraid to squander t|he le%ad and therefore kept retreating.
And t{hr{e{w everything they had in>to our defense.
To hold on to t$he first three points o@f the seas:on.
We all felt a huge weight lifted off our s[ho[ulder[s, said Sc<höpf, whose scoring hea-der played n]o insignificant par,t: "A]nd I am actual*ly the worst header on the team."
But in the end, victory i\s all t*hat c%ounts.
Th\e relie=f was felt throughout the entire arena, not least b_y Tedesco.
W!e wanted to start str>o>n>g in the ea:rl:y s~t~a~ges and m_ak_e a firework of it, said Schalke ’ s head coach.
The win wa>s an important on,e.
Finally we can enjoy ourselves fo-r a few h'our's.
I am ver[y, very h%app%y for the team and the fan-s.
We p|layed smart, calmly a<nd with courage, that is how we must approach matche_s over 90 min*utes
The biggest shor:tcoming of the afternoon: The `*` Royal B.lue.s" missed their chance to establish cont&ro&l over the match e&arly.
After al!l, they did get t:heir cha>nces, for example via the strong Yevhen Konpplyanka, wh&o hit the cros;sbar twice (59th/72^n^d) or Amine Harit (6+2nd).
That way it would not h[ave been su=ch a ne$r$ve wrecking victory, said Tedesco: "You r'e'ally could feel the f%ear a little b-i-t."
So I am glad th[a[t w&e won.
He was n=ot the onl?y one at Schalke.
Fischbach>au: Sm"oke column in the L%eit%za%chtal visible from 2 km
The smoke was h?ar?d t;o miss.
O@n Su`n`day at around 13.30, at a distance of approximately t*wo kilo\me\tres a hiker in the Leitzachtal ob~ser~ved a fire.
The police are no:w investig,ating.
Fischbachau - The c&au&se was soon discovered b<y th[e police and fire departments: A strang'e'r had set fire to ga}rbage on a tw-o square meter are@a at Gschwendner Berg.
According to the police, it appears the fire was mo}nito}re}d f<or a long time, but the embers w$e$re in~adv~ertently left b|ehind.
Close t`o the fo|rest too.
3&0 Fischbachau fi_r_ef_ig_ht_ers were tasked with dispersin.g and extinguishing it.
Th!e police no\w think it is a case o`f arson.
Prof. Dr+. Aladin El-Mafaalani discusses i+ntegration: A discussion a`t eye level
Professor Doctor Aladin El-Mafa`al`an`i is standing b*ef*ore them.
He ha:s once again a^c^c^e^pted the invitation from Ernst Reiling a'nd Lore Hauschild.
F<or many year, I have made it my mission to bring in-t-erest-i-n-g people to Greven, exp_lains the founder and chairman o}f the "Reckenfelder Treff" - th;e a!ssoci!at!io!n t)hat cooperates i~n organizing the evening with the "Kulturpolitik '=' alliance.
E,l,-Mafaalani casually starts the reading, describing the wri_ting process of t$he book, talking about how difficult i~t w!as to explain the topic c;o;mprehensi;b;ly.
With a lot of g*estu*re*s, tangible numbers and a joke or two, he introdu;ces t_he audience to one o{f the m&ost content%io%us topics: Migration and integration.
Wh|y are the$re increasingly conflicts, despite successful integration?
Th/e S|yrian-bor|n author uses a metaphor to answer the que?s?t?ion.
The German soc{iety s.it.s at the big table, t$he migrants of the first g&e&nerat&ion at the kid ’ s t#able.
Their c'hildr'en grow up i|n Germany and want t}o sit at the table.
T_h_e third generation of migrants is bo\rn in Germany . They a]lwa]ys sat a-t the bi:g table and now w@ant to have a say too.
This lea^ds to conflicts.
Therefore, it i(s not o'f im@port@ance whether one is po}litically right o[r lef;t, but: "Am I for or against an op%en society?" he emphasizes.
A@t first rather restrained, then the discussion roun%d gets more and more livel{y.
A_nd there is a need fo[r discussion.
An Afghan refugee reports f-rom his perspective, and two teache,rs e}xpla}in how they s*ee successful o{r unsuccessful integration among students.
El-Mafaalani stands i[n front of the stage, not o;n it, symbolizing the discussion: I%t is a d*isc*ussion at eye leve'l.
The so/ciology professor does no#t for"c"e his opinion onto the audience, emphasizing that he s&p&e&ak&s o,f the average, not of individual destinies.
H&e is happy that peopl@e are in~te~rested in the topi)c, because “ w)e can only find a solution once we u^nderstand wha`t the problem is, ” says El-Mafaalani.
Even during the subsequent signing se+ssion, he still ha[s an open e&a&r for the guests ’ questions and th`e discussion continued in the fo'ye'r ove,r Kurdish specialties.
Basketball: B^onn and Gieße"n win opening games
The Giessen 46ers u-nd the Tele@kom Baskets Bonn h^ave ended t]h]e first match day of Bundesliga Basketball (BBL) with a home and a*n aw`ay victory.

The ambitious team from Bonn wo_n a@t BG Göttingen w#ith 86:79 (49:47).
Alb~a Berlin are the fi`st team at the t)op of the table this season aft?er their 112: 55 thumping on Saturday o:f Scienc:e City Jena.
German champions Bayern Munich and t{he former series champi;o;n Brose Bamberg, by cont(rast, had mo]re of a#n uphill b\at\tle at the beginning of the new season.
Munich fought to a ha_r_d-won 83:77 o@n Friday at ratiopharm Ulm, Bamberg w#on the "Frankenderby" o"n Saturday at s.Oli%ver Würzburg with 84:\80.
Building i!n Landsham: 100 applications for 2[0 properties
The demand is obviously hug?e: O%ver 1=00 interested pa}rties have applied t+o buy one of the properties in South Landsham.
The Pliening c|o|mmunity sold the fi&rst properti?es in the S`outh Landsham development area on the open market.
T`his was reported by the mayor Roland Fr)i)c)k.
Anyway the application p_hase for each of the 20 prope^rti^es, which the m&u&nicipali&ty is offer<ing a}t better conditions and prices - similar to th?e earlier loca=l model, has now ended.
At least 100 a^pp^li^cati^ons h\av\e been received, says F?r?ick.
At present, t%he documents are being rev>iewe>d with regard t:o the application criteria, completeness a'n'd correctness.
Ac\cordi\ng to the Mayor of Pliening, the goal by the e/nd of the year i/s to have the candidate ranking lis[t for the 2.0 pl#ots of land r&ead&y for submission to the l^o^c^al council.
After that th<e awardin*g of the plots can follow.
I!n the ar)ea to the south of L`a`ndsh`am a total o.f 5%0 s~ingle-fa~mily and semi-detached properties will be created, including four areas for apartment blocks ea&rm&arked for eight residential units.
Th>e dev{e{lopment is practically completed, only the stre-ets and pathways now need t\o be asphalted.
A single plot and two for ap}artm}ent buildings belong t&o a private ind+ividual, the rest to t~he mun!ici!pa!lity of Pliening.
T$he municipality sells the bulk o#f the p/lots o|n the open market, 20 plots according t]o the socially responsible model.
T.he t>w>o multi-family houses o;f the borough are to b/e built according to Frick as affordable housing.
W|i|th a total o`f 16 income-oriented flats subsidised b"y the Free State.
Room for 200 peo,ple
Roughly estim]a]ted, t?h?ere will b!e space for about 20*0 people within the pro:perties of the developing area of Landsham-Süd.
Not only this: At t<he s]tart of October, Frick says the new c_onstr_uc_ti_on of a daycare center wi:l:l be~gin.
This will accommodate three kindergarten and thre,e toddler g[roup[s, including a multi%purpose room.
The opening is planned for Sep;tember 2019, the start o+f the n~ext kin?dergarten year.
This way, Schalke p[la[y[er Naldo is also a gr'e'at athlete on th)e bench
Not i"n the starting li|ne|up for the third tim(e in a row: Nevertheless, Na~l~do thanks Schalke coach Domenico T|edes|co.
Gelsenkirchen - After Ro)naldo Aparecido Rodr;igues has not been in the Schalke starting line-up f(or the third time in a row, man}y people wou[ld have understood i?t i\f the almost two-meters-tall Brazil=i=an player had got h^is frustration off his chest.
B*u*t when the Schalke players gath!e!red after the 1-_0 win over FSV Mainz 05 in th$e center circle as usual and head coach Do=menico Tedesco thanked all his players, the 36-year-old n]ickna]med Naldo step}pe}d i/n and s?aid; "We have to thank, coach! '&'
T`hat was very emotional, h)e is such a great sport, Tedesco said l!ater about the react$io$n of his vice-captain, who holds n)o grudge despite his s,eat on the benc<h.
Naldo, w`ho was awarded b@est Schalke player last season, probably k?nows th*at he is actually no]t going to b\e stuck o*n the bench - h/e does have a good reason for this break.
A reason calle$d “ loa.d control . ”
It was no#t easy to tell h{im
It was not e#asy to tell him tha_t, I tell you, Tedesco sai=d w*he*n h!e told Naldo that h^e was not in the starting lineup.
He is an important play~er . H(e is a\n important person.
B;ut it ’ s always about t"he thing, i{t ’ s about the clu`b, ” said Tedesco a~s he justifies the step.
Naldo p=layed 90 minutes against Baye\r\n and Porto.
H;e is 3~6 years old.
I^t is important t!ha!t everyone can catch their breat+h at the moment.
And th,at we keep everyone together, said Tedesco explaining t.h.e rotation, which h,as recently h)i)t Naldo.
And to which t_he Brazilian rea^c^ted wisely: by proving himse%lf a`s a model team player on the bench.
Compared to the rest of t*he e(uro zone, t+h+e descending mood in Austria's industry continued t*o accelerate further i@n August.
T-he purchasing managers index (P^MI) was a*t a 37-month low at 46_.7 points.
Across Europe, how]ever, A)ustria still has the third!-b!es!t mood i"n Europe after Ireland an{d the Netherlands, stated the Markit Institute on Monday about it/s survey o.f 3,000 companies.
I|n contrast to Austria, the euro zone PM?I rose by 1.1 po)ints to 45.1 points, putting t<he index below the growth indicati#ng 50-counter mark for th)e 13th m>onth in a row.
Only Ireland's industry c&r&acked this th)reshol)d in August with 50.9 poi&n&ts.
B!ottom were the Gree#ks (42.1 points).
I}n Ge#rmany, Fran`ce and Spain, the mood barometer did fall, but it fell more s\low\ly than in th:e previous months.
In Spain, the index re&ached 44.0 points, its highest l$e$ve$l since Marc]h.
However, the sli'ghtly eased downswing could mean th{a{t t,he worst is over, said Markit economist Rob Dobs/on.
Ho;we;v;er, the industry - a)t least in the th+ird quarter - remains t!he number one growth brake.
A q@uick return to the grow/t/h zone i@s not in sight: Exp'ort orders to the eurozone have no,t fallen this much since November 2*0*11.
That is why c;ompanies have c&ut bac|k jobs for the seventh month i`n a row.
Industrial production in Ch~ina i@n August fell more strongly than initially as/sume/d.
The mood barometer fel(l from 49.3 points in the previous month t:o 4$7.$6 points.
Experts had in<i<ti<ally expected 4"7.8 points.
The PMI figures ar_e b^ased on representative surveys of 3,00#0 European industrial companies.
Among other t~hi~ngs, the de~ve~l~opment~s in terms of turnover, employment, w)a)reho)us)i)n)g and prices a%r%e recorded.
